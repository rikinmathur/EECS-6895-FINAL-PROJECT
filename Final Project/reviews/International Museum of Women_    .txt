I volunteered here. Doing so helped me realize that I need to be an activist and attorney to work in international feminist issues on the level I desire. I am an old friend of Paola Gianturco...author of Celebrating Women. IMOW put on an exhibit for her book in fall 2004.
I know we are not supposed to review places we are affiliated with, but I am a volunteer here, and I want to be helpful by letting everyone know that this is not a physical museum - it is a "virtual" or online museum. Â Every once in a while somebody will come to the office expecting to visit a museum and, of course, become extremely confused when they just see a bunch of people at desks. You can visit their exhibitions online or go to their speaker series events that they host here in San Francisco, just don't try to visit in person!
