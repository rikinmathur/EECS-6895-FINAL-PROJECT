Things have improved a lot here! The lights are on until at least 10 pm and the wonderful crew has been keeping the park clean. New trees were planted and the last big one at risk was never removed.
Took my son here and he loved it. It was well maintained and had maint. guys when we were there.It was super windy when we were there. I love the wood structures.
On my walk home from the Sunset over the weekend I happened to pass by this rather charming little park on Page Street. As I walked through the park I felt that it was a shame no one was playing on the playground or reading a book on a bench in their little garden. This place is clearly well kept as it was sparkling clean and quite inviting. In my opinion this is an ideal park for all ages. Had I not been alone, or bright daylight, I would have sprinted for the zip line, swayed on the teeter totter, then hopped on the tire swing for an hour. The gardens are well kept and inviting for a relaxing afternoon reading your book on a park bench. What I also loved were the handmade tiles that inspired "Peace and Love" which covered the walls to the park on Page and Buchannan streets. Nice touch!
Went here this weekend, I thought it was very nice, quiet and clean.  They have a cute little community garden in the back that seems well kept.  I didn't see any doggy doo so it looke like they keep it pretty clean.  So far I would go back.
it's true; it's not as dirty as i originally thought. *feeling guilty* now that i've been taking the pup here for almost a year, i have much respect for koshland and the people who work to keep it awesome. it's well manicured and not so much a shit hole these days. plus, i've met several now really great friends there in the past year that i would see regularly when we have doggie play time. the kids who play here aren't always friendly, but the dogs and their people are! i am absolved of said guilt now.
