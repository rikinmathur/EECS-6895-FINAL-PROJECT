Awesome FREE family friendly museum that features the maritime history of San Francisco.  Great exhibits with lots of interaction, sounds, videos and artifacts.  Amazingly well done... I'm seriously impressed!  This is a National Park Service Museum, so if your collecting passport stamp cancellations bring your NPS passport.It's located in the same building as the Argonaut hotel & Blue Mermaid and across the street from the Hyde Street Pier in Fishermans Warf.
Outstanding Maritime Museum On The Bay!SITREPI recently got to enjoy the San Francisco Museum Of Modern Art (SFMOMA) "On The Go" event here at the Maritime Museum!Located right on the Bay, it is an impressive structure that is easily accessible by people walking from the nearby park, the pier waterfront and the beaches.yelp.com/biz_photos/mari…THE SETUPSince SFMOMA is currently having their facilities remodeled, they have been partnering up with other museums and institutions in putting on their "On The Go" events!  The most recent installation was held here at the Maritime Museum and was a beautiful affair that included light bites and wine-tasting.THE MARITIME EXHIBITSMaritime Museum has some beautiful pieces of art (some quite modern), of photography (the black & white pieces have a way of being etched into your mind), and historic pieces that even include portions of actual boats.  The exhibits can be quite moving, such as looking at a picture of the seamen of a ferry boat that is subtitled with the news that the boat capsized soon after the picture was taken and no one survived.yelp.com/biz_photos/mari…THE LOWDOWNA stop at the Maritime Museum makes for a memorable stop on the waterfront where one can learn about some interesting maritime history in the area.
0 stars.  This is a review for the museum in the Aquatic Park Bathhouse Building.  My boyfriend and I walk in and there's 3 little exhibits/dioramas on the right.  The people behind the desk never say anything and keep on with their conversation.  We go up the set of stairs, hoping there's more on that floor, but it's absolutely empty!  It would have been nice if that area was roped off.  We go downstairs again, walk out, the people behind the desk keep on talking amongst themselves and we exit the buidling.  So much for that.I even called the place a couple days before my visit to ask about ticket information, so it would have been helpful if the person had said that there's nothing in the actual bathhouse building itself.
A great trip through the history of San Francisco, pretty large and extensive, especially for being entirely free. Not too far from Fisherman's Wharf and the end of the trolley car line, so lots to do in the area and easy to get to. Way to go, National Park Service.
This place was AMAZING!!! I stumbled in with a friend while we were trying to kill time waiting for a reservation and I couldn't believe my eyes... It was huge and one of the most entertaining museums I've ever been in. (Maybe because I wasn't expecting anything and got such a  treat!)I would absolutely bring visitors here to get a unique perspective on the city.  I felt like I learned a ton wile having SO much fun.
I hadn't ever noticed this spot before but I'm quite happy we stumbled upon it. It's definitely a great little spot which offers some historical context of the area.
This place is so cool!  Love the old ships.  (Great place to watch fireworks on the 4th of July!)  Also, very nice displays inside.  Great to learn the history of the Bay.
I hadn't been to the museum since the 80's when it was in the old building. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the job they've done, once I was inside the new place. The panorama video was well done, the displays were interesting and well laid out, and the documentary in the library has my 10 year old daughter ready to join the merchant marines. Good on her! She has my blessing, not that she'd ask.Oh, and it's free!  A rare gem in a part of the city that I generally try to avoid.
I LOVE this museum and once a month they host a Sea Chanty sing-a-long on one of the ships in the harbor.  TRULY a GREAT experience!
I am very proud to have the display of the Paladini Seafood Company at the museum. It is a great honor.Achille Paladini
I think the museum does a great job, especially the visitor center - woah! The exhibits are gorgeous, and really immersive. I really had fun running around the place and exploring. If I had kids I'd def take them there!
This may seem premature considering the Museum is still under construction and won't open until next year but what a place to go!Call me romantic but there's just something about sailing ships and ocean air that beckons.The place was a trove of all that is sea-faring, especially here in San Francisco. And as it was always free, I can't tell you how many times I ventured inside!The location is good too...far enough away from the majority of tourists who repeatedly ask directions for Joe's Crab Shack and Ripley"s!Not sure if they will charge upon opening but if you like sailing, the ocean and history of the Bay, please go!
I like to go in there and browse the displays for a while, it's so relaxing and enjoyable to imagine what it was like back in the old days around SF, it was a busy area even back in the old days.I cant wait for it to reopen again!
