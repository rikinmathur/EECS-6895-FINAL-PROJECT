First and foremost, thank you for the free drink, whoever got it for me! Sorry, I'm just not good with names...Little Skillet is an awesome establishment to get a drink with friends or coworkers, eat some amazing fried chicken and waffles, watch sports, and just relax after an exhausting day at work. Staff is wonderful and food is delicious.The Fried Chicken was crispy, tender, and juicy - just cooked/fried to perfection. Waffles were topped with sugar and were warm and soft. Syrup is a little different from the regular syrup I would get at the supermarket; it seemed a little thicker and had a stronger/powerful taste. Extensive list of cocktails and drinks to choose from. You should be able to find something you want.Really interesting decor. Industrial and hip. Located in alley and only a few blocks from the Caltrain Station. A must try.
Nice bar and decent food! If I could I would give this restaurant a 3.5/5 Me and my friends got here right before taking the Caltrain out of town. While close to the Caltrain, the bar is in an alley which is a little bit sketchy. Nonetheless, we're all safe in San Fran right! :) Got into Little Skillet and was pretty impressed with the decor + music. I was feeling a burger so I just got a regular burger & fries (typical bar food), while my friends got "The Works" - Little Skillet's speciality of fried chicken & a side. Our food arrived very quickly, so I had no problem craving for my burger. The meat was cooked well, although I felt there should have been less raw onions and vegetables on the burger (caramelized or cooked would have been a lot better!), and my friends told me their fried chicken was a little dry. That being said, it was definitely still appetizing and our group's opinion was the food was... "alright!" Overall I felt the prices were a little bit higher than I would have liked ($14 for a standard burger), and I definitely think food could have been cooked/prepared a little better. However, these guys definitely deserve some bonus points for their beautiful interior with nice lighting, music, TV's and overall atmosphere. Keep on rocking the soul food! :)
Very very disappointing experience. My girlfriend and I would come here quite often and the wait will be usually 10-15 minutes. We waited a while 40 minutes tonight! It wasn't until a little more than half an hour in when the cashier finally asked us if we're waiting for food. He looked like he didn't even want to be there. I forgot to get his name, but he should definitely be fired. I know how tough it is in the food service industry and I don't want to hate, but we didn't get one apology or one explanation to why the food was delayed. He did ask us if we wanted a drink or dessert, but how about some sort of apology or even my bad? The only good thing about what happened was that he refunded us for the food, but still no apology or explanation, not even an excuse. I really want to give them another chance because their food is good, but this experience really ruined it. This is so sad.
Holy crap. The service here is the worst. I've eaten here three to four times during the weekends and usually the wait for our food is 15-20 mins. But today is the worst. We waited for our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of corn muffins for 45 mins. Wanna know why? because whoever that cashier was working tonight freaking lost our ticket and he didnt even bother to tell us that he never put the order in. How do I know? I was counting his tickets and his orders the whole time as I was sitting directly across from the counter. The people who came after us after half hour got their food right away. But we were still waitinf the whole time! then whoever was serving/cashier guy tonight passed our table at one point and asked us if we were waitinf for our food even though we had one of their stands indictating that we havent had our food yet! And then when he finally had our one bowl and chili and 6 pieces of cornbread given to us, he didnt even apologize and instead asked us if we wanted a dessert or drink for  time wasted waitinf for our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread. my boyfriend and I were pretty pissed at that point but we chose not to be confrontational and we said no. Mind you, I had a caltrain to catch so we barely had 10 mins of time left to eat our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread. Then the server/cashier guy came back and gave us a refund for our food. But the way he said sounded like he was doing us a favor. He said " I refunded you guys". OH REALLY? WOW THATS GREAT, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO???? Not even one drop of "my bad" or "sorry for waiting" or an explanation why we didnt get our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread earlier while everyone that came after us did!My boyfriend and I worked in the food service industry so we dont like to be confrontational or be rude when we dont get our food on time. They only had one server and two cooks in the kitchen. The place was busy already, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We understand it sucks to only be the one working, but damn at least give your customers some respect. If you know you messed up and were lucky not to have me go off you a$$, an apology is much appreciated. My one bowl of chili was barely cooked, and my 6 pieces of cornbread came out cold. Will we ever come back to this place again? Hell no. There's actually better and legit chicken and waffle places out there that also comes with good customer service #rantover
Uh, no to soul food from here.  Perhaps we were too lazy to cook for Easter and Little Skillet happened to be open via Eat24, but the food was cold.  Like left out all day cold.  I was even surprised when I got an Eat24 text alert that my food would arrive in 20 minutes but now I know why.Chicken was okay, juicy but cold, but also not impressive compared to Popeye's or even Happy Donuts in the neighborhood vicinity.  I want juicy greasy chicken on the inside and a crispy outer layer.  Seasoned fries were seasoned with some generic seasoning, and they tasted worst than In N Out fries.  Oh, and they were cold.Ribs were okay and generic tasting but I've had better.  And it was cold.Mac and cheese was stale with few bits of Panko crumbs.  When I think of good Mac and cheese, I'm talking about loaded with bacon pieces, Panko crumbs to give it texture and put on a surprise cheese element like blue cheese on top.We tossed our leftovers and that rarely happens. So my lesson learned is to stay away from soul food cooked my hipsters (I'm assuming based on the delivery dude) and stick to soul food places that are crazy packed with homeless people, a la Happy Donuts or Popeye's.  They know what's up.
Juicy thighs, dry breasts. If you're a breast man or gal, be prepared to try it dry. We got there right around dinner time. You'd think all the chicken they serve is freshly fried and not for too long, but the white meat translated to dry meat. But if thighs adore you, then you won't be too disappointed as it stayed juicy.The waffles are on the softer side; if that floats your boat, that's great! If you like your waffles crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, well, you may be a bit disappointed.Good selection of beer on tap to wash down that chicken and starch. The coleslaw is no good; as good as picking up a piece of gum off the floor and trying hard to imagine it's delicious. I'm not sure how they managed to pull that off; I love raw cabbage and coleslaw and somehow it turned out belonging in the trashcan.
The best breakfast sandwich in SF. Ive been here several times and the food is always great. Randomly on weekends they'll have bands come thru and play a gig. The bloody Mary's are actually really good now. They used to be just ok. This place started as a take out only walk up counter. We used to order and sit on the ledge across the street. Now they have seating and a bar. And the food is still fantastic. Pro tips-Order the spicy bloody without the celery. The celery beanstalk takes up like 20% of this great drink. So skipping gives you more.-Order the breakfast sandwich with waffles for bread then take one waffle and put it on a side plate. Now you have waffles and a sandwich:)-Check whether the Giants are playing. FBLS continues to become a popular spot for pre gaming-There is limited street parking. In a pinch I've parked in the law office parking lot that's is immediately adjacent to the building. The law office is closed on weekends. And you can see your car thru the restaurant window if you park there. -Did I mention you should order the breakfast sandwich:)*********Update: the New Orleans style band plays there 12-2 on Sundays
Food was ok. My doors weren't blown away.Perhaps I'm not a southern fried chicken connoisseur but I didn't find it incredibly impressive. The pieces were on the smaller side and there just wasn't enough in the box. i did appreciate the crunch but lacked juiciness. The collard greens were too tart. My friend has had collard greens growing up and he commented that they're not supposed to be that tart. The waffles were crunch but doughy. We also ordered the Egg McMahon that other reviews raved about. This was a step up from the regular waffle. It was an pretty satisfying bite w/ the oozy egg and the bits of sausage in the gravy.3 pieces of chicken w/ a side, an order of waffles, Egg McMahon and 2 drinks was approximately $37.
If you want some GOOD down home soul food then this is your place to be!! The BEST fried chicken that'll make you eat even just the skin with no meat on it. Mac 'n Cheese that is cheesy and melts in your mouth with a undertone of spice!! Cole slaw that is made to perfection with no runny residue. The Red Velvet cake looked scrumptious but had no room for it this trip. Nice bar selection. Great soul, Cajun and zydeco music being played. Can't get back here soon enough. Now, for the one downside, when and if you go to the ladies room, there are NO toilet seat covers!! Not saying anything about the clientele BUT (no pun intended) I really don't want to sit after others on the buff.
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G Food @ Little Skillet! 1st time customer for brunch but it won't be my last. Exploring (or lost in the city) and ran into this spot and am so glad I did!! Store front window, food prepared freshly and so good for my tummy! Another great experience at this spot. Andouille and grits was AWESOME!
Get there by 12:05 to avoid the massive lines that ensue. Service is quick. Chicken juicy with crisp crust, and the waffles, sprinkled in powdered sugar, we're like doughnuts at lunch! I noticed a giant basket of toys and books -- for those with families.
I didn't find anything great about Little Skillet. The food was mediocre and the coffee wasn't great either. We ordered the waffle breakfast plate and the farmer's omelette. I asked for the eggs to be over medium but they were over easy at most. The waffles and syrup was tasty but there was nothing special about the eggs. The combination of the eggs, bacon and waffles tasted bland other than the syrup that made it sweeter. The omelette had a nice selection of vegetables but it also tasted bland. There was a side of potatoes that came with the omelette that were nice and crunchy though.The coffee (self serve) was lukewarm in one of the coffee dispensers. Luckily there was a second one which had warmer coffee in it.
Our uber driver took us into a alley and I started praying.Little did I know, we soon arrived at Little Skillet. Upon walking in, I was ready to smoke a cigar and chill at the bar.Price: Look to spend about $10 per item.Parking: UNSUREService: EhhDrinks: They have a full bar and serve bloody marys.Food:Chicken & waffles: Fried chicken was ON POINT. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffles were crispy, but not soft. Pecan Pie: SPOT ON. Full of pecans and less of that gooey sugar stuff.Seafood Gumbo: They do NOT skimp on the seafood. Bomb stuff.Notes: The vibe of this place is awesome. Food is presented super cute-ly.
This place is soooooo good.  I'm in love with soulfood, and this place is situated perfectly in an alley pretty close to the ballpark, and I see now that they have a cute DJ with good jams on Saturday afternoons.  This place has a beautiful and spacious ambiance, and it also has a home comfortable feeling that a truly good soul restaurant should have.  Everything I have tried is good, their biscuits and Gravy, chicken and waffles, collard greens.., etc , oh and the bloody Mary's , so so so GOOD !! Charming place
Really friendly counter people. Awesome view of the kitchen where it looks super exciting. Ordering and waiting for your food (window) was an awesome experience. Fried chicken was super awesome. Crispy crunchy and so juicy and tender in the inside. I have to say it was the best fried chicken breast I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Hot sauce known as crystal was great. Everything else was disappointing considering how much I spent. And I feel like I spent a lot. I don't think I will be coming back here until I'm more ballin and shot callin cause there was no value for me for the price. That being said it could also be that maybe I just don't like corn meal waffles and didn't see the sparkle in the apple cider syrup. I suggest this place... Sadly it is not to my specific taste. And you shouldn't give a crap about that. Cause taste buds are like snowflakes. Go try for yourself!!!
Okay so far this has been the best chicken and waffles I've had in the bay area. I know that's a huge thing to claim but after eating her a few times the food is consistently good. Basically if you come here then you need to order the chicken and waffles. Chicken - The batter is crispy, light and oh so tasty. I usually don't eat the skin when it comes to fried chicken but I eat it here every time. The meat is tasty and tender and I wonder to myself how I could ever eat another fried chicken place. Sorry Church's (I still like them biscuits)Waffles - First thought is, how good can a waffle be right? Well its good. Light, sweet, fluffy, crispy (if i could describe it with other words you can insert them here) and somehow the perfect pairing for that fried chicken.They are in a back alley so most folks end up sitting on the loading dock of the building across the alley way which is a nice spot to hang out and chat. Pretty much this place is worth it so you should stop by.
Lovely place for brunch and some delicious comfort food! The entrance is off an alley and looks kinda hole-in-the-wall but the inside is actually huge (2 separate dining areas) and beautifully decorated, especially during the holiday season! We came around 1pm on a Sunday and there was plenty of seating. You order at a counter and they'll bring your food out to you wherever you find a place to sit.I got the off-menu "Eggs MaMahon" per yelp recommendations, which is waffles topped with either sausage or mushroom gravy (your choice) and 2 over-easy eggs - it was super indulging, savory, and flavorful. However, it did get a bit heavy towards the end. I would maybe recommend splitting it with someone. I also tried my friend's fried chicken po'boy, which was pretty tasty, especially the cajun remoulade. Chicken is inherently kind of dry though, I'd go for shrimp or fish instead. They also have a pretty extensive brunch cocktail menu if you're in the mood. I would definitely come back to try some of these and the fried chicken/waffles! :)
WOW, Am I really driving to a bar intentionally to eat bar food ?WOW, the portion size.WOW, The speed at which my order came out!!Yes, I was quite impressed with this place, Although it is not the BEST BEST gumbo I've had , It definitely hits the spot, and its probably 2x as big as the usual portion size in SF especially for the price. Yes I would definitely come back here.I like my Gumbo with a darker Roux, but the flavor here was pretty delish. The thickness caught me a little off guard at first, as I was just getting used to eating a thinner gumbo, presumably without file powder in it? Anyways, there was a generous amount of white rice underneath the delicious gumbo.. and much to my surprise, HUGE SHRIMP. As I bit into the first shrimp, I noticed there was a buttery smokey flavor to it. Whattttt?!!?! YUM !!! There were many shrimp in my bowl in addition to catfish. WIN!!!!Hubs pork sliders were just ok, a little on the dry side, but If you want to add a side dish to your meal, Get the Jalapeno Cole slaw, We loved it !!
"I am on a chicken and waffle adventure"---Little Skillet. In a bar that just exploded with people once 6:00PM on a Friday hit. This waffle has been my favorite waffle so far. A small fluffy square of goodness that put a smile on my face and found a happy place in my belly. The chicken was interesting. Very tender. Almost like it was braised. I did like that the chicken came with both light and dark meat. It tasted pretty good, but that texture just wasn't doing it for me. Too mushy. Would not come back here for chicken and waffles as a dish. But I could get down on that mac and cheese again. And the waffle. Such a good waffle.
I tried Little Skillet a few years ago when you had to order from a tiny window outside and eat on a way-too-sunny loading dock on an industrial SoMa side street.  Thankfully, they've partnered with Victory Hall so you can order your food at an inside kiosk fast casual style where you get a number and they bring it to wherever you plop down among the ample seating.  This totally changes the game because before you'd basically need to walk to South Park to enjoy your food in a comfortable setting.  Plus, now ample bathroom access to wash the chicken off your hands before you had back to the office.3 Piece Chicken & Waffles: A super indulgent pairing to liven up a workday lunch.  Two waffles that are fist-sized; they're not going to fill you up alone, but there is enough to complement the chicken.  Fluffy with a little crunch.  The chicken is good: juicy and crunchy.  It has a rather light batter, which is totally fine given all the carbs in the waffles.  Great when eaten with some of that Crystal's hot sauce between bites of syrup soaked waffles.Arnold Palmer: I really don't go out of my way for Iced Tea or Lemonade, but for some reason their combo really does it for me.  Not as acidic as pure lemonade and not as dull as pure iced tea.  A great sidekick to salty and sweet main course.
First and foremost, thank you for the free drink, whoever got it for me! Sorry, I'm just not good with names...Little Skillet is an awesome establishment to get a drink with friends or coworkers, eat some amazing fried chicken and waffles, watch sports, and just relax after an exhausting day at work.

I was feeling a burger so I just got a regular burger & fries (typical bar food), while my friends got "The Works" - Little Skillet's speciality of fried chicken & a side. Our food arrived very quickly, so I had no problem craving for my burger. The meat was cooked well, although I felt there should have been less raw onions and vegetables on the burger (caramelized or cooked would have been a lot better!), and my friends told me their fried chicken was a little dry. That being said, it was definitely still appetizing and our group's opinion was the food was... "alright!" Overall I felt the prices were a little bit higher than I would have liked ($14 for a standard burger), and I definitely think food could have been cooked/prepared a little better.

WOW, Am I really driving to a bar intentionally to eat bar food ?WOW, the portion size.WOW, The speed at which my order came out!!Yes, I was quite impressed with this place, Although it is not the BEST BEST gumbo I've had , It definitely hits the spot, and its probably 2x as big as the usual portion size in SF especially for the price. Yes I would definitely come back here.I like my Gumbo with a darker Roux, but the flavor here was pretty delish. The thickness caught me a little off guard at first, as I was just getting used to eating a thinner gumbo, presumably without file powder in it? Anyways, there was a generous amount of white rice underneath the delicious gumbo.. and much to my surprise, HUGE SHRIMP. As I bit into the first shrimp, I noticed there was a buttery smokey flavor to it. Whattttt?!!?! YUM !!! There were many shrimp in my bowl in addition to catfish. WIN!!!!Hubs pork sliders were just ok, a little on the dry side, but If you want to add a side dish to your meal, Get the Jalapeno Cole slaw, We loved it !!
"I am on a chicken and waffle adventure"---Little Skillet. In a bar that just exploded with people once 6:00PM on a Friday hit. This waffle has been my favorite waffle so far. A small fluffy square of goodness that put a smile on my face and found a happy place in my belly. The chicken was interesting. Very tender. Almost like it was braised. I did like that the chicken came with both light and dark meat. It tasted pretty good, but that texture just wasn't doing it for me. Too mushy. Would not come back here for chicken and waffles as a dish. But I could get down on that mac and cheese again. And the waffle. Such a good waffle.
I tried Little Skillet a few years ago when you had to order from a tiny window outside and eat on a way-too-sunny loading dock on an industrial SoMa side street.  Thankfully, they've partnered with Victory Hall so you can order your food at an inside kiosk fast casual style where you get a number and they bring it to wherever you plop down among the ample seating.  This totally changes the game because before you'd basically need to walk to South Park to enjoy your food in a comfortable setting.  Plus, now ample bathroom access to wash the chicken off your hands before you had back to the office.3 Piece Chicken & Waffles: A super indulgent pairing to liven up a workday lunch.  Two waffles that are fist-sized; they're not going to fill you up alone, but there is enough to complement the chicken.  Fluffy with a little crunch.  The chicken is good: juicy and crunchy.  It has a rather light batter, which is totally fine given all the carbs in the waffles.  Great when eaten with some of that Crystal's hot sauce between bites of syrup soaked waffles.Arnold Palmer: I really don't go out of my way for Iced Tea or Lemonade, but for some reason their combo really does it for me.  Not as acidic as pure lemonade and not as dull as pure iced tea.  A great sidekick to salty and sweet main course.
First and foremost, thank you for the free drink, whoever got it for me! Sorry, I'm just not good with names...Little Skillet is an awesome establishment to get a drink with friends or coworkers, eat some amazing fried chicken and waffles, watch sports, and just relax after an exhausting day at work. Staff is wonderful and food is delicious.The Fried Chicken was crispy, tender, and juicy - just cooked/fried to perfection. Waffles were topped with sugar and were warm and soft. Syrup is a little different from the regular syrup I would get at the supermarket; it seemed a little thicker and had a stronger/powerful taste. Extensive list of cocktails and drinks to choose from. You should be able to find something you want.Really interesting decor. Industrial and hip. Located in alley and only a few blocks from the Caltrain Station. A must try.
Nice bar and decent food! If I could I would give this restaurant a 3.5/5 Me and my friends got here right before taking the Caltrain out of town. While close to the Caltrain, the bar is in an alley which is a little bit sketchy. Nonetheless, we're all safe in San Fran right! :) Got into Little Skillet and was pretty impressed with the decor + music. I was feeling a burger so I just got a regular burger & fries (typical bar food), while my friends got "The Works" - Little Skillet's speciality of fried chicken & a side. Our food arrived very quickly, so I had no problem craving for my burger. The meat was cooked well, although I felt there should have been less raw onions and vegetables on the burger (caramelized or cooked would have been a lot better!), and my friends told me their fried chicken was a little dry. That being said, it was definitely still appetizing and our group's opinion was the food was... "alright!" Overall I felt the prices were a little bit higher than I would have liked ($14 for a standard burger), and I definitely think food could have been cooked/prepared a little better. However, these guys definitely deserve some bonus points for their beautiful interior with nice lighting, music, TV's and overall atmosphere. Keep on rocking the soul food! :)
Very very disappointing experience. My girlfriend and I would come here quite often and the wait will be usually 10-15 minutes. We waited a while 40 minutes tonight! It wasn't until a little more than half an hour in when the cashier finally asked us if we're waiting for food. He looked like he didn't even want to be there. I forgot to get his name, but he should definitely be fired. I know how tough it is in the food service industry and I don't want to hate, but we didn't get one apology or one explanation to why the food was delayed. He did ask us if we wanted a drink or dessert, but how about some sort of apology or even my bad? The only good thing about what happened was that he refunded us for the food, but still no apology or explanation, not even an excuse. I really want to give them another chance because their food is good, but this experience really ruined it. This is so sad.
Holy crap. The service here is the worst. I've eaten here three to four times during the weekends and usually the wait for our food is 15-20 mins. But today is the worst. We waited for our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of corn muffins for 45 mins. Wanna know why? because whoever that cashier was working tonight freaking lost our ticket and he didnt even bother to tell us that he never put the order in. How do I know? I was counting his tickets and his orders the whole time as I was sitting directly across from the counter. The people who came after us after half hour got their food right away. But we were still waitinf the whole time! then whoever was serving/cashier guy tonight passed our table at one point and asked us if we were waitinf for our food even though we had one of their stands indictating that we havent had our food yet! And then when he finally had our one bowl and chili and 6 pieces of cornbread given to us, he didnt even apologize and instead asked us if we wanted a dessert or drink for  time wasted waitinf for our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread. my boyfriend and I were pretty pissed at that point but we chose not to be confrontational and we said no. Mind you, I had a caltrain to catch so we barely had 10 mins of time left to eat our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread. Then the server/cashier guy came back and gave us a refund for our food. But the way he said sounded like he was doing us a favor. He said " I refunded you guys". OH REALLY? WOW THATS GREAT, WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO???? Not even one drop of "my bad" or "sorry for waiting" or an explanation why we didnt get our one bowl of chili and 6 pieces of cornbread earlier while everyone that came after us did!My boyfriend and I worked in the food service industry so we dont like to be confrontational or be rude when we dont get our food on time. They only had one server and two cooks in the kitchen. The place was busy already, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We understand it sucks to only be the one working, but damn at least give your customers some respect. If you know you messed up and were lucky not to have me go off you a$$, an apology is much appreciated. My one bowl of chili was barely cooked, and my 6 pieces of cornbread came out cold. Will we ever come back to this place again? Hell no. There's actually better and legit chicken and waffle places out there that also comes with good customer service #rantover
Uh, no to soul food from here.  Perhaps we were too lazy to cook for Easter and Little Skillet happened to be open via Eat24, but the food was cold.  Like left out all day cold.  I was even surprised when I got an Eat24 text alert that my food would arrive in 20 minutes but now I know why.Chicken was okay, juicy but cold, but also not impressive compared to Popeye's or even Happy Donuts in the neighborhood vicinity.  I want juicy greasy chicken on the inside and a crispy outer layer.  Seasoned fries were seasoned with some generic seasoning, and they tasted worst than In N Out fries.  Oh, and they were cold.Ribs were okay and generic tasting but I've had better.  And it was cold.Mac and cheese was stale with few bits of Panko crumbs.  When I think of good Mac and cheese, I'm talking about loaded with bacon pieces, Panko crumbs to give it texture and put on a surprise cheese element like blue cheese on top.We tossed our leftovers and that rarely happens. So my lesson learned is to stay away from soul food cooked my hipsters (I'm assuming based on the delivery dude) and stick to soul food places that are crazy packed with homeless people, a la Happy Donuts or Popeye's.  They know what's up.
Juicy thighs, dry breasts. If you're a breast man or gal, be prepared to try it dry. We got there right around dinner time. You'd think all the chicken they serve is freshly fried and not for too long, but the white meat translated to dry meat. But if thighs adore you, then you won't be too disappointed as it stayed juicy.The waffles are on the softer side; if that floats your boat, that's great! If you like your waffles crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, well, you may be a bit disappointed.Good selection of beer on tap to wash down that chicken and starch. The coleslaw is no good; as good as picking up a piece of gum off the floor and trying hard to imagine it's delicious. I'm not sure how they managed to pull that off; I love raw cabbage and coleslaw and somehow it turned out belonging in the trashcan.
The best breakfast sandwich in SF. Ive been here several times and the food is always great. Randomly on weekends they'll have bands come thru and play a gig. The bloody Mary's are actually really good now. They used to be just ok. This place started as a take out only walk up counter. We used to order and sit on the ledge across the street. Now they have seating and a bar. And the food is still fantastic. Pro tips-Order the spicy bloody without the celery. The celery beanstalk takes up like 20% of this great drink. So skipping gives you more.-Order the breakfast sandwich with waffles for bread then take one waffle and put it on a side plate. Now you have waffles and a sandwich:)-Check whether the Giants are playing. FBLS continues to become a popular spot for pre gaming-There is limited street parking. In a pinch I've parked in the law office parking lot that's is immediately adjacent to the building. The law office is closed on weekends. And you can see your car thru the restaurant window if you park there. -Did I mention you should order the breakfast sandwich:)*********Update: the New Orleans style band plays there 12-2 on Sundays
Food was ok. My doors weren't blown away.Perhaps I'm not a southern fried chicken connoisseur but I didn't find it incredibly impressive. The pieces were on the smaller side and there just wasn't enough in the box. i did appreciate the crunch but lacked juiciness. The collard greens were too tart. My friend has had collard greens growing up and he commented that they're not supposed to be that tart. The waffles were crunch but doughy. We also ordered the Egg McMahon that other reviews raved about. This was a step up from the regular waffle. It was an pretty satisfying bite w/ the oozy egg and the bits of sausage in the gravy.3 pieces of chicken w/ a side, an order of waffles, Egg McMahon and 2 drinks was approximately $37.
If you want some GOOD down home soul food then this is your place to be!! The BEST fried chicken that'll make you eat even just the skin with no meat on it. Mac 'n Cheese that is cheesy and melts in your mouth with a undertone of spice!! Cole slaw that is made to perfection with no runny residue. The Red Velvet cake looked scrumptious but had no room for it this trip. Nice bar selection. Great soul, Cajun and zydeco music being played. Can't get back here soon enough. Now, for the one downside, when and if you go to the ladies room, there are NO toilet seat covers!! Not saying anything about the clientele BUT (no pun intended) I really don't want to sit after others on the buff.
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G Food @ Little Skillet! 1st time customer for brunch but it won't be my last. Exploring (or lost in the city) and ran into this spot and am so glad I did!! Store front window, food prepared freshly and so good for my tummy! Another great experience at this spot. Andouille and grits was AWESOME!
Get there by 12:05 to avoid the massive lines that ensue. Service is quick. Chicken juicy with crisp crust, and the waffles, sprinkled in powdered sugar, we're like doughnuts at lunch! I noticed a giant basket of toys and books -- for those with families.
I didn't find anything great about Little Skillet. The food was mediocre and the coffee wasn't great either. We ordered the waffle breakfast plate and the farmer's omelette. I asked for the eggs to be over medium but they were over easy at most. The waffles and syrup was tasty but there was nothing special about the eggs. The combination of the eggs, bacon and waffles tasted bland other than the syrup that made it sweeter. The omelette had a nice selection of vegetables but it also tasted bland. There was a side of potatoes that came with the omelette that were nice and crunchy though.The coffee (self serve) was lukewarm in one of the coffee dispensers. Luckily there was a second one which had warmer coffee in it.
Our uber driver took us into a alley and I started praying.Little did I know, we soon arrived at Little Skillet. Upon walking in, I was ready to smoke a cigar and chill at the bar.Price: Look to spend about $10 per item.Parking: UNSUREService: EhhDrinks: They have a full bar and serve bloody marys.Food:Chicken & waffles: Fried chicken was ON POINT. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffles were crispy, but not soft. Pecan Pie: SPOT ON. Full of pecans and less of that gooey sugar stuff.Seafood Gumbo: They do NOT skimp on the seafood. Bomb stuff.Notes: The vibe of this place is awesome. Food is presented super cute-ly.
This place is soooooo good.  I'm in love with soulfood, and this place is situated perfectly in an alley pretty close to the ballpark, and I see now that they have a cute DJ with good jams on Saturday afternoons.  This place has a beautiful and spacious ambiance, and it also has a home comfortable feeling that a truly good soul restaurant should have.  Everything I have tried is good, their biscuits and Gravy, chicken and waffles, collard greens.., etc , oh and the bloody Mary's , so so so GOOD !! Charming place
Really friendly counter people. Awesome view of the kitchen where it looks super exciting. Ordering and waiting for your food (window) was an awesome experience. Fried chicken was super awesome. Crispy crunchy and so juicy and tender in the inside. I have to say it was the best fried chicken breast I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Hot sauce known as crystal was great. Everything else was disappointing considering how much I spent. And I feel like I spent a lot. I don't think I will be coming back here until I'm more ballin and shot callin cause there was no value for me for the price. That being said it could also be that maybe I just don't like corn meal waffles and didn't see the sparkle in the apple cider syrup. I suggest this place... Sadly it is not to my specific taste. And you shouldn't give a crap about that. Cause taste buds are like snowflakes. Go try for yourself!!!
Okay so far this has been the best chicken and waffles I've had in the bay area. I know that's a huge thing to claim but after eating her a few times the food is consistently good. Basically if you come here then you need to order the chicken and waffles. Chicken - The batter is crispy, light and oh so tasty. I usually don't eat the skin when it comes to fried chicken but I eat it here every time. The meat is tasty and tender and I wonder to myself how I could ever eat another fried chicken place. Sorry Church's (I still like them biscuits)Waffles - First thought is, how good can a waffle be right? Well its good. Light, sweet, fluffy, crispy (if i could describe it with other words you can insert them here) and somehow the perfect pairing for that fried chicken.They are in a back alley so most folks end up sitting on the loading dock of the building across the alley way which is a nice spot to hang out and chat. Pretty much this place is worth it so you should stop by.
Lovely place for brunch and some delicious comfort food! The entrance is off an alley and looks kinda hole-in-the-wall but the inside is actually huge (2 separate dining areas) and beautifully decorated, especially during the holiday season! We came around 1pm on a Sunday and there was plenty of seating. You order at a counter and they'll bring your food out to you wherever you find a place to sit.I got the off-menu "Eggs MaMahon" per yelp recommendations, which is waffles topped with either sausage or mushroom gravy (your choice) and 2 over-easy eggs - it was super indulging, savory, and flavorful. However, it did get a bit heavy towards the end. I would maybe recommend splitting it with someone. I also tried my friend's fried chicken po'boy, which was pretty tasty, especially the cajun remoulade. Chicken is inherently kind of dry though, I'd go for shrimp or fish instead. They also have a pretty extensive brunch cocktail menu if you're in the mood. I would definitely come back to try some of these and the fried chicken/waffles! :)
WOW, Am I really driving to a bar intentionally to eat bar food ?WOW, the portion size.WOW, The speed at which my order came out!!Yes, I was quite impressed with this place, Although it is not the BEST BEST gumbo I've had , It definitely hits the spot, and its probably 2x as big as the usual portion size in SF especially for the price. Yes I would definitely come back here.I like my Gumbo with a darker Roux, but the flavor here was pretty delish. The thickness caught me a little off guard at first, as I was just getting used to eating a thinner gumbo, presumably without file powder in it? Anyways, there was a generous amount of white rice underneath the delicious gumbo.. and much to my surprise, HUGE SHRIMP. As I bit into the first shrimp, I noticed there was a buttery smokey flavor to it. Whattttt?!!?! YUM !!! There were many shrimp in my bowl in addition to catfish. WIN!!!!Hubs pork sliders were just ok, a little on the dry side, but If you want to add a side dish to your meal, Get the Jalapeno Cole slaw, We loved it !!

This place is soooooo good.  I'm in love with soulfood, and this place is situated perfectly in an alley pretty close to the ballpark, and I see now that they have a cute DJ with good jams on Saturday afternoons.  This place has a beautiful and spacious ambiance, and it also has a home comfortable feeling that a truly good soul restaurant should have.  Everything I have tried is good, their biscuits and Gravy, chicken and waffles, collard greens.., etc , oh and the bloody Mary's , so so so GOOD !! Charming place
Really friendly counter people. Awesome view of the kitchen where it looks super exciting. Ordering and waiting for your food (window) was an awesome experience. Fried chicken was super awesome. Crispy crunchy and so juicy and tender in the inside. I have to say it was the best fried chicken breast I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Hot sauce known as crystal was great. Everything else was disappointing considering how much I spent. And I feel like I spent a lot. I don't think I will be coming back here until I'm more ballin and shot callin cause there was no value for me for the price. That being said it could also be that maybe I just don't like corn meal waffles and didn't see the sparkle in the apple cider syrup. I suggest this place... Sadly it is not to my specific taste. And you shouldn't give a crap about that. Cause taste buds are like snowflakes. Go try for yourself!!!
Okay so far this has been the best chicken and waffles I've had in the bay area. I know that's a huge thing to claim but after eating her a few times the food is consistently good. Basically if you come here then you need to order the chicken and waffles. Chicken - The batter is crispy, light and oh so tasty. I usually don't eat the skin when it comes to fried chicken but I eat it here every time. The meat is tasty and tender and I wonder to myself how I could ever eat another fried chicken place. Sorry Church's (I still like them biscuits)Waffles - First thought is, how good can a waffle be right? Well its good. Light, sweet, fluffy, crispy (if i could describe it with other words you can insert them here) and somehow the perfect pairing for that fried chicken.They are in a back alley so most folks end up sitting on the loading dock of the building across the alley way which is a nice spot to hang out and chat. Pretty much this place is worth it so you should stop by.
Lovely place for brunch and some delicious comfort food! The entrance is off an alley and looks kinda hole-in-the-wall but the inside is actually huge (2 separate dining areas) and beautifully decorated, especially during the holiday season! We came around 1pm on a Sunday and there was plenty of seating. You order at a counter and they'll bring your food out to you wherever you find a place to sit.I got the off-menu "Eggs MaMahon" per yelp recommendations, which is waffles topped with either sausage or mushroom gravy (your choice) and 2 over-easy eggs - it was super indulging, savory, and flavorful. However, it did get a bit heavy towards the end. I would maybe recommend splitting it with someone. I also tried my friend's fried chicken po'boy, which was pretty tasty, especially the cajun remoulade. Chicken is inherently kind of dry though, I'd go for shrimp or fish instead. They also have a pretty extensive brunch cocktail menu if you're in the mood. I would definitely come back to try some of these and the fried chicken/waffles! :)
WOW, Am I really driving to a bar intentionally to eat bar food ?WOW, the portion size.WOW, The speed at which my order came out!!Yes, I was quite impressed with this place, Although it is not the BEST BEST gumbo I've had , It definitely hits the spot, and its probably 2x as big as the usual portion size in SF especially for the price. Yes I would definitely come back here.I like my Gumbo with a darker Roux, but the flavor here was pretty delish. The thickness caught me a little off guard at first, as I was just getting used to eating a thinner gumbo, presumably without file powder in it? Anyways, there was a generous amount of white rice underneath the delicious gumbo.. and much to my surprise, HUGE SHRIMP. As I bit into the first shrimp, I noticed there was a buttery smokey flavor to it. Whattttt?!!?! YUM !!! There were many shrimp in my bowl in addition to catfish. WIN!!!!Hubs pork sliders were just ok, a little on the dry side, but If you want to add a side dish to your meal, Get the Jalapeno Cole slaw, We loved it !!
"I am on a chicken and waffle adventure"---Little Skillet. In a bar that just exploded with people once 6:00PM on a Friday hit. This waffle has been my favorite waffle so far. A small fluffy square of goodness that put a smile on my face and found a happy place in my belly. The chicken was interesting. Very tender. Almost like it was braised. I did like that the chicken came with both light and dark meat. It tasted pretty good, but that texture just wasn't doing it for me. Too mushy. Would not come back here for chicken and waffles as a dish. But I could get down on that mac and cheese again. And the waffle. Such a good waffle.
I tried Little Skillet a few years ago when you had to order from a tiny window outside and eat on a way-too-sunny loading dock on an industrial SoMa side street.  Thankfully, they've partnered with Victory Hall so you can order your food at an inside kiosk fast casual style where you get a number and they bring it to wherever you plop down among the ample seating.  This totally changes the game because before you'd basically need to walk to South Park to enjoy your food in a comfortable setting.  Plus, now ample bathroom access to wash the chicken off your hands before you had back to the office.3 Piece Chicken & Waffles: A super indulgent pairing to liven up a workday lunch.  Two waffles that are fist-sized; they're not going to fill you up alone, but there is enough to complement the chicken.  Fluffy with a little crunch.  The chicken is good: juicy and crunchy.  It has a rather light batter, which is totally fine given all the carbs in the waffles.  Great when eaten with some of that Crystal's hot sauce between bites of syrup soaked waffles.Arnold Palmer: I really don't go out of my way for Iced Tea or Lemonade, but for some reason their combo really does it for me.  Not as acidic as pure lemonade and not as dull as pure iced tea.  A great sidekick to salty and sweet main course.
