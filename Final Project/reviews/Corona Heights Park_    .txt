Awesome view of SF! You can also do a little bit of rock climbing too :) Lots of cute dogs too!Tips for visiting:- There are street parking around since the park is located in a pretty nice neighborhood.- Wear shoes you don't mind getting dirty. There were mud patches when we visited, even though it hadn't rained...- There are 2-3 giant rocks that you can climb on to get an even better view of the city - Bring a jacket! Get's pretty windy in the evening. - If you are afraid of dogs you should avoid this park because a lot of people come to walk their dogs- You can see Mission Dolores Park to the east!
Hands down the best view of the city.  I was wary of even writing this review because I did not want to share this little secret.  Other people have claimed best views int he city.  Grand View Park, Twin Peaks, Coit Tower.  None are as good at this.  Twin Peaks is great if you can catch it on a non cloudy day (almost never).  Coit Tower is blocked by ridiculous high shrubbery.  Grand View Park is nice... but just nice.   Corona Heights Park gives nearly a 360 view of the city on a clear day.  Bring some music and some drinks and enjoy the skyline on a nice day or beautiful night.If you park at the museum it will be a shorter but steeper climb up the steps.  Its a very brief workout for those who never go work out.  An easier walk is to park at the corner of Museum Way and Roosevelt.Bring a coat.  Even if it's not windy it can get windy on top of the park.Great place to go on the 4th of July.  But get there early.
Great views of downtown.  And I've knocked out another of SF's hills.  Funny, I was looking down upon Corona Heights from Tank Hill and thought, "Might as well try that hill since I haven't been there yet".  So, that's where we headed from Tank Hill.Wonderful views of many parts of SF from up there.  Go late afternoon for the best lighting -- as we did.
Yeesh, I hate to give up a killer "secret" spot to view the SF skyline, but Corona Heights Park (CHP) is better than the tourist-laden Twin Peaks (TP).Located above the Castro District and downslope from TP, CHP is a downright odd place with rock outcroppings and a close-up view of downtown and The SF Bay.Lot's of dogs too - it has a dog park.I found the place during an exploratory mission of SF several months ago and returned this past weekend with a whole crew of "day-trippers."Parking is sketchy, footing borders on deadly, views are spectacular and CHP is a 5 star spot to me.PLEASE don't go there, tell anyone about it or advertise in any way/shape/form its "badassness!"5 stars
This is the first park I'd ever visited in San Francisco, and it opened my eyes to how many amazing vantage points of the city there are. The trek up to Corona Heights is quiet and peaceful. It's also a little rocky with dirt paths, so make sure to wear shoes with good grip if possible. I didn't realize that this was a "dog park" because people bring their dogs everywhere anyways... but I like that this place has more of a local vibe rather than the more crowded Twin Peaks area. Nice hilly walk!
This park has a really stellar view of the city. I finally decided to check it out since it's only 20 minutes walking from my house. Once you get to the entrance to the park- the ascent is only about 5 minutes, and is pretty easy- so if you park near the entrance it's a breeze. However climbing up the hill on 15th to get there is another struggle in itself- definitely wore my puppy out! I went on a Sunday morning and there was only one couple there- I was surprised how empty it was because the weather was phenomenal. I will likely make this my go-to weekend dog walk.
Well it's hard to call this a hike.. it's barely a 20-30 minute hike but you do get great views of SF from the top and it's a nice hike you can jog up.There are a few entrances and the most challenging(still fairly easy) and most fun is the entrance from 15th Street from the Tennis courts. It's a great little park as it's in the city and easily accessible.On a clear day, you can see the city from 360 degrees including a great view of Twin peaks.After all the good Latin food in Mission, i recommend this little hike up the hill to take in some views :)value 5/5atmosphere 5/5 it could get really windy up at topservice 4/5 easily marked trailquality 5/5 bang for the buck19/20
There are many places in the city where you can get a good view and Corona Heights is one of those places!  A popular dog friendly park, CH is just a hop and skip away from all the madness of the bustling city.  It's tranquil up at the peak, but not entirely secluded where you will feel unsafe.  There are 360 degree views of SF.  You can see both bridges and everything in between and beyond.  There is a paved main trail that leads up to the summit as well as other hiking trails along the mountain.  Great place for photo ops.  Lots of locals as well as tourists tend to gather here.  Of course, there are lots of dogs running around too.
Cute little "hike" to bring your pups. By hike, I mean five minute walk. The hike to the top is super short and easy to get to. I went on a weekday and there was a lot of people at the top so I didn't get a chance to sit down and enjoy the view. I decided to check out the off leash play area and it was your typical dirt area that was fenced. I prefer dog parks with grass because with my dog running around like an energizer bunny, dust always gets into my eyes. It's a nice place to check out but i probably wouldn't come back just because the hike is not strenuous enough to tire out my pitbull puppy!
Recommendation: Great place for a view of the city and minor climbing on rocks. Very windy, when we went. Cool! I went here with friends this past weekend during a trek around the mission, and this was one of the highlights of the day! We were somewhat disappointed when we had to climb hill after hill just to find another one waiting, but once we got to the top we were happy we made the climb. The 360 degree view of the city was fantastic! The Sutro Tower was just peeking out beyond the clouds, the skyline was at the extent of our vision towards the east, and the Mission sprawled out at our feet had an incredible amount of diversity. Looking down in all directions, perched at the top of the rock formation at the summer, we felt like kings and queens. I don't know how much of a "dog park" this is, but even if that is what the place is marketed as, it was great as a people park too! We started out on 16th Street looking for an entrance there, but the hole in the fence had been patched up. We then wandered along Flint Street until we found the steps and path that led up past the tennis courts to branch off to the building, but we decided to continue on to the right and head to the bench overlooking the east, where we stopped for a meal. There was a squatter's little camp nestled into the fencing at the bottom of the area though, which detracted a little from the view. After the quick break we continued the climb up the deteriorating wooden/dirt terrace steps up higher, where we took a side path directly up to the summit. It was definitely quite a view, but on our way down (on the opposite side) the path was much easier to follow. I'll definitely be taking people up that west path next time!
This place has some of the best views in the city and not nearly as many people as some of the other hotspots. Additionally, it's next to Buena Vista Park if you want to get some extra exercise in (the views and surroundings aren't as stunning but it makes for a decent urban park). I like to go to Bacon Bacon afterwards to undo any health benefits I just accomplished
Best place for great views of the city. I've came here once on a weekend and once on a Monday. When I went during the week there was hardly anyone there. I think parking is limited to two hours but no meters :) The weekends get a little busier which makes parking kind of tough, but that's typical SF. You can get great clear views and see the fog rolling in behind you as well. There's a few boulders you can climb on which depending on where you sit, kind of blocks the wind.  It gets super windy/cold up there even if it's not a windy day. Would really recommend bringing  a scarf and hat.Wouldn't really call it a hike. There's just a lot of stairs to get to the top. Not bad at all. I'd definitely come here during the week if you can! Would love to come back at night too. As for dogs, I only saw one and from my two times coming here people seem to do a good job pick up after them and keeping them on their leashes.
This is Benji and my favorite park in SF. Street parking is easy and the hike up takes less than 5 minutes. The panoramic view at the top is breathtaking and never gets old. There are also lots of friendly pups for Benji to play with and it's super safe for him to wander around.We finish off each visit with some play time in the dog run area. Benji loves the big water bowl and he enjoys being able to play with dogs of all different sizes. I've taken several visitors to this park and everyone agrees that it's a winner.
I dig this park! I never even knew it was here, but I feel like it gives you the same beautiful views you'd get at the always cloudy Twin Peaks but for less effort! My friend and I were traveling from Land's End to Mission when Google Maps routed us past this park. We saw the giant hills and knew that we needed to park and take a walk up this hill to see what we were missing. Street parking wasn't terribly difficult to find near the park--and it doesn't seem like a super frequented park since there weren't that many people there.Anyways, it's a light 5-minute walk up paved steps to get to the top. We went the day after #hellastorm so it was pretty muddy and gross, but I'm sure it would have been lovely on a normal day. The views are SPECTACULAR. I think the photos on Yelp definitely do it justice. You're very much almost in the center ish area of SF so you get great views to the north, east, and south. I don't remember views of the west, but maybe we just forgot to check. Anyways I just dig the place since it gives really nice views--not sure how it would hold up in the fog? Maybe just as well since it's not very high up yet you're still able to see a lot of SF.tldr; awesome park, definitely worth stopping by if you want some nice views of sf!
I really wanted to love Corona Heights! Pros: easy parkingbig fenced in area for dogsgreat views of the cityCons:fenced in area does not have separation for big/small dogslots of dog walkers bring their dogs here to play and some of them can be a little too aggressive (there were a fair share of germans, pit bulls, etc)material of the doggie play area-if you have a poodle or poodle mix (we have a doodle) the material of the doggie play area really gets matted into their fur. We spent a few hours removing the sharp sticks out of our pup's body and paws. It really gets stuck in there too.As long as you are aware of the cons, the pros are really great! We won't be bringing our pooch back just because it takes too much out of mommy and daddy to de-mat her hair!
Simply magical.This park has wonderful views of the city, and a nice rock formation you can climb on top of.You can basically see the whole city, and check out the bay, mount Tam and mount Diablo. Pretty romantic spot, but also pretty good place to bring visiting friends, to show off how great SF is!
The views here rival or even beat those at Twin Peaks! Much less touristy and I hope it stays that way.Parking is minimal to none but is a easy walk from Castro.  I got so many stellar shots here.  Gosh, I love SF!
Sweeping views from GG bridge to the west and bay bridge to the east. An enclosed dog run with watering station.  Nice  incline path to the peak.  A few drought tolerant landscaped areas,  and dispersed wooden benches to sit and take in the elevated hideaway.  Caution: SF residence snap at you if you don't pick up ur dog's poop after 5 seconds.
The view = WIN. AWESOME.Dog park, fenced in area = FAIL.  Why? Because portions of the fence line has either fallen down, or there is NONE, or there are HOLES.  Is this okay for ME? I suppose.  But for the dogs? NO.  This is very unsafe.   The gates need work--they either get stuck or do not lock properly.  Safety first. The trails = nice but there are dogs running up from the fenced area (from the holes) up to the trail.  Overall, this area is quiet, and very good for a short hike. Parking = there's some street parking but be careful to not use Randall Museum's parking, and make sure to read the signs.
If twin peaks is too windy, this is the place to be! I can imagine myself watching fireworks here in the near future... Oops that was suppose to be my secret.. Oh well what good is a secret if you can't tell anyone?!I've came here during the day and nights, and the nights are my favorite because the view of SF is just breathtaking, but BEWARE there are sneaky THIRSTYYYY mosquitos everywhere!!! I got at least 8 last night :'(

Yeesh, I hate to give up a killer "secret" spot to view the SF skyline, but Corona Heights Park (CHP) is better than the tourist-laden Twin Peaks (TP).Located above the Castro District and downslope from TP, CHP is a downright odd place with rock outcroppings and a close-up view of downtown and The SF Bay.Lot's of dogs too - it has a dog park.I found the place during an exploratory mission of SF several months ago and returned this past weekend with a whole crew of "day-trippers."Parking is sketchy, footing borders on deadly, views are spectacular and CHP is a 5 star spot to me.PLEASE don't go there, tell anyone about it or advertise in any way/shape/form its "badassness!"5 stars

It was definitely quite a view, but on our way down (on the opposite side) the path was much easier to follow. I'll definitely be taking people up that west path next time!
This place has some of the best views in the city and not nearly as many people as some of the other hotspots. Additionally, it's next to Buena Vista Park if you want to get some extra exercise in (the views and surroundings aren't as stunning but it makes for a decent urban park). I like to go to Bacon Bacon afterwards to undo any health benefits I just accomplished
Best place for great views of the city. I've came here once on a weekend and once on a Monday. When I went during the week there was hardly anyone there. I think parking is limited to two hours but no meters :) The weekends get a little busier which makes parking kind of tough, but that's typical SF. You can get great clear views and see the fog rolling in behind you as well. There's a few boulders you can climb on which depending on where you sit, kind of blocks the wind.  It gets super windy/cold up there even if it's not a windy day. Would really recommend bringing  a scarf and hat.Wouldn't really call it a hike. There's just a lot of stairs to get to the top. Not bad at all. I'd definitely come here during the week if you can! Would love to come back at night too. As for dogs, I only saw one and from my two times coming here people seem to do a good job pick up after them and keeping them on their leashes.
This is Benji and my favorite park in SF. Street parking is easy and the hike up takes less than 5 minutes. The panoramic view at the top is breathtaking and never gets old. There are also lots of friendly pups for Benji to play with and it's super safe for him to wander around.We finish off each visit with some play time in the dog run area. Benji loves the big water bowl and he enjoys being able to play with dogs of all different sizes. I've taken several visitors to this park and everyone agrees that it's a winner.
I dig this park! I never even knew it was here, but I feel like it gives you the same beautiful views you'd get at the always cloudy Twin Peaks but for less effort! My friend and I were traveling from Land's End to Mission when Google Maps routed us past this park. We saw the giant hills and knew that we needed to park and take a walk up this hill to see what we were missing. Street parking wasn't terribly difficult to find near the park--and it doesn't seem like a super frequented park since there weren't that many people there.Anyways, it's a light 5-minute walk up paved steps to get to the top. We went the day after #hellastorm so it was pretty muddy and gross, but I'm sure it would have been lovely on a normal day. The views are SPECTACULAR. I think the photos on Yelp definitely do it justice. You're very much almost in the center ish area of SF so you get great views to the north, east, and south. I don't remember views of the west, but maybe we just forgot to check. Anyways I just dig the place since it gives really nice views--not sure how it would hold up in the fog? Maybe just as well since it's not very high up yet you're still able to see a lot of SF.tldr; awesome park, definitely worth stopping by if you want some nice views of sf!
I really wanted to love Corona Heights! Pros: easy parkingbig fenced in area for dogsgreat views of the cityCons:fenced in area does not have separation for big/small dogslots of dog walkers bring their dogs here to play and some of them can be a little too aggressive (there were a fair share of germans, pit bulls, etc)material of the doggie play area-if you have a poodle or poodle mix (we have a doodle) the material of the doggie play area really gets matted into their fur. We spent a few hours removing the sharp sticks out of our pup's body and paws. It really gets stuck in there too.As long as you are aware of the cons, the pros are really great! We won't be bringing our pooch back just because it takes too much out of mommy and daddy to de-mat her hair!
Simply magical.This park has wonderful views of the city, and a nice rock formation you can climb on top of.You can basically see the whole city, and check out the bay, mount Tam and mount Diablo. Pretty romantic spot, but also pretty good place to bring visiting friends, to show off how great SF is!
The views here rival or even beat those at Twin Peaks! Much less touristy and I hope it stays that way.Parking is minimal to none but is a easy walk from Castro.  I got so many stellar shots here.  Gosh, I love SF!
Sweeping views from GG bridge to the west and bay bridge to the east. An enclosed dog run with watering station.  Nice  incline path to the peak.  A few drought tolerant landscaped areas,  and dispersed wooden benches to sit and take in the elevated hideaway.  Caution: SF residence snap at you if you don't pick up ur dog's poop after 5 seconds.
The view = WIN. AWESOME.Dog park, fenced in area = FAIL.  Why? Because portions of the fence line has either fallen down, or there is NONE, or there are HOLES.  Is this okay for ME? I suppose.  But for the dogs? NO.  This is very unsafe.   The gates need work--they either get stuck or do not lock properly.  Safety first. The trails = nice but there are dogs running up from the fenced area (from the holes) up to the trail.  Overall, this area is quiet, and very good for a short hike. Parking = there's some street parking but be careful to not use Randall Museum's parking, and make sure to read the signs.
If twin peaks is too windy, this is the place to be! I can imagine myself watching fireworks here in the near future... Oops that was suppose to be my secret.. Oh well what good is a secret if you can't tell anyone?!I've came here during the day and nights, and the nights are my favorite because the view of SF is just breathtaking, but BEWARE there are sneaky THIRSTYYYY mosquitos everywhere!!! I got at least 8 last night :'(
Awesome view of SF! You can also do a little bit of rock climbing too :) Lots of cute dogs too!Tips for visiting:- There are street parking around since the park is located in a pretty nice neighborhood.- Wear shoes you don't mind getting dirty. There were mud patches when we visited, even though it hadn't rained...- There are 2-3 giant rocks that you can climb on to get an even better view of the city - Bring a jacket! Get's pretty windy in the evening. - If you are afraid of dogs you should avoid this park because a lot of people come to walk their dogs- You can see Mission Dolores Park to the east!
Hands down the best view of the city.  I was wary of even writing this review because I did not want to share this little secret.  Other people have claimed best views int he city.  Grand View Park, Twin Peaks, Coit Tower.  None are as good at this.  Twin Peaks is great if you can catch it on a non cloudy day (almost never).  Coit Tower is blocked by ridiculous high shrubbery.  Grand View Park is nice... but just nice.   Corona Heights Park gives nearly a 360 view of the city on a clear day.  Bring some music and some drinks and enjoy the skyline on a nice day or beautiful night.If you park at the museum it will be a shorter but steeper climb up the steps.  Its a very brief workout for those who never go work out.  An easier walk is to park at the corner of Museum Way and Roosevelt.Bring a coat.  Even if it's not windy it can get windy on top of the park.Great place to go on the 4th of July.  But get there early.
Great views of downtown.  And I've knocked out another of SF's hills.  Funny, I was looking down upon Corona Heights from Tank Hill and thought, "Might as well try that hill since I haven't been there yet".  So, that's where we headed from Tank Hill.Wonderful views of many parts of SF from up there.  Go late afternoon for the best lighting -- as we did.
Yeesh, I hate to give up a killer "secret" spot to view the SF skyline, but Corona Heights Park (CHP) is better than the tourist-laden Twin Peaks (TP).Located above the Castro District and downslope from TP, CHP is a downright odd place with rock outcroppings and a close-up view of downtown and The SF Bay.Lot's of dogs too - it has a dog park.I found the place during an exploratory mission of SF several months ago and returned this past weekend with a whole crew of "day-trippers."Parking is sketchy, footing borders on deadly, views are spectacular and CHP is a 5 star spot to me.PLEASE don't go there, tell anyone about it or advertise in any way/shape/form its "badassness!"5 stars
This is the first park I'd ever visited in San Francisco, and it opened my eyes to how many amazing vantage points of the city there are. The trek up to Corona Heights is quiet and peaceful. It's also a little rocky with dirt paths, so make sure to wear shoes with good grip if possible. I didn't realize that this was a "dog park" because people bring their dogs everywhere anyways... but I like that this place has more of a local vibe rather than the more crowded Twin Peaks area. Nice hilly walk!
This park has a really stellar view of the city. I finally decided to check it out since it's only 20 minutes walking from my house. Once you get to the entrance to the park- the ascent is only about 5 minutes, and is pretty easy- so if you park near the entrance it's a breeze. However climbing up the hill on 15th to get there is another struggle in itself- definitely wore my puppy out! I went on a Sunday morning and there was only one couple there- I was surprised how empty it was because the weather was phenomenal. I will likely make this my go-to weekend dog walk.
Well it's hard to call this a hike.. it's barely a 20-30 minute hike but you do get great views of SF from the top and it's a nice hike you can jog up.There are a few entrances and the most challenging(still fairly easy) and most fun is the entrance from 15th Street from the Tennis courts. It's a great little park as it's in the city and easily accessible.On a clear day, you can see the city from 360 degrees including a great view of Twin peaks.After all the good Latin food in Mission, i recommend this little hike up the hill to take in some views :)value 5/5atmosphere 5/5 it could get really windy up at topservice 4/5 easily marked trailquality 5/5 bang for the buck19/20
There are many places in the city where you can get a good view and Corona Heights is one of those places!  A popular dog friendly park, CH is just a hop and skip away from all the madness of the bustling city.  It's tranquil up at the peak, but not entirely secluded where you will feel unsafe.  There are 360 degree views of SF.  You can see both bridges and everything in between and beyond.  There is a paved main trail that leads up to the summit as well as other hiking trails along the mountain.  Great place for photo ops.  Lots of locals as well as tourists tend to gather here.  Of course, there are lots of dogs running around too.
Cute little "hike" to bring your pups. By hike, I mean five minute walk. The hike to the top is super short and easy to get to. I went on a weekday and there was a lot of people at the top so I didn't get a chance to sit down and enjoy the view. I decided to check out the off leash play area and it was your typical dirt area that was fenced. I prefer dog parks with grass because with my dog running around like an energizer bunny, dust always gets into my eyes. It's a nice place to check out but i probably wouldn't come back just because the hike is not strenuous enough to tire out my pitbull puppy!
Recommendation: Great place for a view of the city and minor climbing on rocks. Very windy, when we went. Cool! I went here with friends this past weekend during a trek around the mission, and this was one of the highlights of the day! We were somewhat disappointed when we had to climb hill after hill just to find another one waiting, but once we got to the top we were happy we made the climb. The 360 degree view of the city was fantastic! The Sutro Tower was just peeking out beyond the clouds, the skyline was at the extent of our vision towards the east, and the Mission sprawled out at our feet had an incredible amount of diversity. Looking down in all directions, perched at the top of the rock formation at the summer, we felt like kings and queens. I don't know how much of a "dog park" this is, but even if that is what the place is marketed as, it was great as a people park too! We started out on 16th Street looking for an entrance there, but the hole in the fence had been patched up. We then wandered along Flint Street until we found the steps and path that led up past the tennis courts to branch off to the building, but we decided to continue on to the right and head to the bench overlooking the east, where we stopped for a meal. There was a squatter's little camp nestled into the fencing at the bottom of the area though, which detracted a little from the view. After the quick break we continued the climb up the deteriorating wooden/dirt terrace steps up higher, where we took a side path directly up to the summit. It was definitely quite a view, but on our way down (on the opposite side) the path was much easier to follow. I'll definitely be taking people up that west path next time!
