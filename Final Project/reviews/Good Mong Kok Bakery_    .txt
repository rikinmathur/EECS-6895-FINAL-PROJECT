Went a few hours out of my way to pick up $40 worth of dim sum goodness.Dollar-for-dollar, simply the best dim sum you can score (you wanna sit down and have it brought out to you on a cart: different conversation). Highly recommend the steamed pork buns, and my family went ape for the baked version. Also highly recommend the shark fin and shu mai. Don't waste your time on the peanut/chive dumpling, however (and this is coming from someone who loves both ingredients.
Great spot to get some good "ha gao" shrimp dumplings and shu Mai.  While we were there, spotted the "ma lie go" (Malaysian sponge cake).  $7.30 breakfast for two... Yummy, and satisfying without overstuffing ourselves.  Wish I live closer.... As NY doesn't have as good of "ha gao" and shu mai!
Aside from getting to watch how fortune cookies are made this dim sum place in Chinatown was well worth walking up and down the same streets to finally decide where to eat. That's the problem with Yelp, there are just too many choices (was only looking at the ones with 4 stars). I would definitely make this your dim sum to-go place. There isn't anywhere to sit down at (and I'm not going to take a star off for it) but they take credit card and that helped me to buy more and try so many different things. You meet the most interesting people in lines. While we were waiting in line for dim sum; which wasn't very long we lucked out, we met an older man who said he worked for Steve Jobs wife. But the most interesting thing about it is he never mentioned her name. He just kept referring to her as "Steve Jobs" wife. So I'm not sure if he really did or not. Any ways, back to the food...The man behind the counter spoke enough English to help me place my order. He was really nice and patient which I don't find often in Chinatown shops. He made an effort to describe which dumpling was what despite the language barrier. And he didn't get mad when I wanted to add more stuff to my order. He even recommend me trying the melon cake thingy and the egg yolk tart which I've always wanted to try but never have for whatever reason only that I didn't know what it was. The scallion pancake by far was the best. Not the typical pancake I'm used to but the flavor was so DELISH. It had this brushed salty dough glaze that just sealed the deal for me. The shrimp dumplings and the shrimp with scallion dumpling were right up on our yumminess scale. About $2.10 per serving of 3. Very clean looking and loaded with lots of shrimp. Two servings could me a meal. We also got a chicken or pork dumpling trio that looks like it's sitting in a little basket. Not sure what it's called but those were very meaty in size as well. I love steamed pork chao su bau and my hubby likes the baked so we got both. The pork wasn't dry and chewy tough like I've had from other places. Almost forgot the sesame bean paste balls that I have to always get. They're the size of racquet balls and have the perfect chewy texture. So if you're walking all around Chinatown trying to decide what Yelp location to go to like us then go here. You won't be disappointed and I hope you meet someone interesting in line.
I read about these places that people stand in line for in the big cities.   Stand in line? WTH are you talkin about?  1000's of restaurants to try that probably have NO waiting and you are the dummy standing in line for food?   This isn't Cold War Russia!  This is America!  Well actually it's Chinatown, which is in San Francisco, which ultimately IS technically in The United States of America.  So yeah...no waiting in line for this patriot!Well that is....unless....it's my last day in the city....and like...it's some Asian Holiday and my new friends really needed to try this place.  So yeah. 45 minute line?  No problem. I've done dim sum in the city before and loved it, this was no different.  This was good food.  Affordable and fresh and worth the wait.   I could not stop eating the shrimp ones.  Glad I only bought like 6 of those.  But we went for breakfast meal time and it lived up to its name.  Whatever that name actually means. I have no idea.  I doubt that when you head over, they will be selling bags and bags of stuff all at once.  So go in, and tell them that the white guy sent you....you know the one that looks just like all the other white guys?  Yeah him.
Ode to the (long) Sunday Morning Line:Delicious food, I will wait for thee (for 40 mins)I will strike a conversation with thy neighbor (bonus if they speak English)Look at Yelp for a pics/menu while in line (you have a 1 min window with staff to order)If all fails, yell frantically and point at a bunch of random stuff (everything is good anyway)It's busy, in a good way. The food is delicious and all the items are fresh as can be. I recommend everything, but if you need to pair that down, then try the bao (try one steamed and one baked), the zhong (sticky rice wrapped in leaves), and at least one sweet pastry item and one dim sum item. This will give you a well rounded taste of the menu. This is the type of bakery that makes a Chinatown shine, and should be visited when in town. It's one of the last to remain open while others have closed. BRING CASHHHHHHHH.
I've been struggling to write this review, as I don't know how to properly elaborate how good this food is and how much it means to me. I can't, so I'll just keep it short and sweet.Food: 5/5. Massive dim sum, with crazy explosive flavor. Don't even need soy sauce like other dim sum eateries. Be careful though as they sell out of things by early afternoon (har gow, some buns). Shu Mai is the greatest thing there. Price: ridiculously cheap. Ambience: slightly stressful ordering process with cramped quarters. No longer cash only, can use cards now!!!Overall: my favorite dim sum place on the planet. Deserves to be in its own tier, as it's way better than some of my other 5 star reviews. Best restaurant in Bay Area for me.
Truly amazing place!!! I paid $2.10 for 3 dumplings. I was so full from trying as many restaurants as I could in San Fran, but I could not pass this place up. It was a little hard to order as there was a bit of a language barrier. I just pointed to the ones that looked particularly good. I ended up with shrimp, shrimp and pork, and beef. All three were phenomenal. My absolute favorite was the shrimp though!!!  Ugh so good. Next time I'm in San Francisco I will absolutely be back!!
Good Mong Kok is one of the highest rated places on Yelp in San Francisco Chinatown. I enjoyed what I had, but I am 3 starring it because what I had didn't really blow my mind. I am definitely ignorant about what makes a great dim sum place, so know that before you trust my review. But on the whole, it was just ok to me. I had a pork bun which was really tasty, shrimp dumpling, and one other thing that I'm not entirely sure what it was. I told the girl shark fin, but she left off a couple things from my order, so who really know what was going on. The line was really long, and I went to another place down the street and couldn't really discern the difference between the two.
This is a great to-go spot for dim sum especially for the price and portions of the food. I thoroughly enjoyed everything, but some things I ordered were a tad too oily. All in all, a solid place to go for some dim sum!
If you are in Chinatown and need a quick snack, make sure you stop by Good Mong! Tasty, cheap, to go dim sum! Came on a Friday and expected a crazy line, but lucked out and there was only a few people.Service is quick, just tell them what you want and they get it ready for you. But make sure you know what you want so you don't stand there like a lost baby. They move fast!I was very surprised they take credit card. Shui Mai - $2.10 - Basic dim sum staple, comes with 3. Shrimp Dumpling - $2.10 - Har Gow, basic dim sum staple, comes with 3. Pan Fried Scallion Cake - $1 - Thick and chewy, with great green onion flavor. So cheap and so good!Steam BBQ Bun - $1.10 - Char Siu Bao. Ton of pictures of this, tasted like any bun you get at dim sum.Chicken Bun - $1.10 - I love chicken baos. Chicken baos are usually 3 times the size but this was a miniature version.
Had been meaning to try this place for years now, after hearing really good things about their shrimp dumplings (har gow). Having limited experience with dim sum in SF, I figured I would go with the most popular. In my experience, the better dim sum in NY/Philly is only experienced in parlors/sit-down restaurants, so the concept of straight-up dim sum stands was relatively new to me. I'd been to Wing Sing and Delicious Dim Sum, but friends kept telling me to go to Good Mong Kok. The line was still out the door when a few of us came to visit on a Saturday afternoon, which I took to be a good sign. Another good thing was that the line moved relatively fast, and we only waited outside for about 5 minutes. The dim sum was definitely impressive, both in flavor and in sheer size. The (huge) shrimp dumplings weren't greasy at all, and yet also not overly dry, and the shrimp inside was tender and flavorful. Didn't even need soy sauce. Shu mai was also hefty and delicious as well. I also tried one of their cha siu buns, which were absolutely enormous, and full of pork. The fried turnip cakes were delicious too, although those were actually a little on the greasier side, but still very filling. I liked that you could tell that they used actual turnips, as there was a considerable bit of texture in the cake. They also had sticky rice and a lot of other favorites, but I decided to not stuff myself silly, in the hopes of not putting myself into a coma for the rest of the day. Adult decisions, man.Service was pretty quick, and my non-Chinese-speaking friends were able to order without a hitch, as they do have the menu in English. I was also fairly impressed with how patient they were with people just perusing the menu. I think I'm too used to getting yelled at in Chinatown, ha. Prices were obviously incredibly cheap, with most dumplings at 3 for $2, and large buns for about $1-2. Definitely preferable to Wing Sing and Delicious Dim sum nearby, mostly because it's not as greasy, and because it's clean(er). Also, Delicious Dim Sum doesn't have anything in their menu in English, which can be a problem for some people. Without a question, I will be back at Good Mong Kok.
The line was unbearably slow and took a long time to navigate.  When I reached the end of the line I felt rushed.  I had no idea what some of the things I ordered were.  I was amazed at how little we paid for the amount of food we got.  Five stars!Welcome to the unforgettable experience that is Good Mong Kok Bakery.  My Yelp Community Director had listed this as a "1000% you must do this".  He's often right, except when it comes to iPads or Disney. We decided to walk here early on a Sunday morning.  We arrived at 8:15am and encountered a long line.  Wow, I wonder how bad the line gets later in the day.  To be honest the line took way longer than I expected. I had a flight to catch in a few hours.  I was starting to get antsy and thought about bailing at one point.  I'm glad I stayed though.  Forty five minutes after we got in line it was time to encounter the madness inside.  I would liken it to getting tossed into a tornado.  There are a lot of customers crammed inside.  There was little English spoken by the plethora of employees behind the counter rapidly moving around. The English descriptions on the wall were minimal at best, especially the one that just said "meat dumpling".  What exactly is that? As someone with a severe tree nut allergy I was more than a little concerned that I wouldn't know everything in my food based on the signage. I just crossed my fingers and hoped that the almond cookie was the only item with nuts in it. The first woman who helped me ran to the back room after I asked for a pineapple bun.  She was gone for so long I started questioning whether she was coming back. I eventually got helped by someone else.  I pointed to a few things, she threw them in a bag, and I was out the door for less than five bucks cost. The chicken bun I got was delicious and had a large serving of meat.  I couldn't even finish all of my shui mai because I got so full. The guy that was in line behind us was a regular customer and said that the wait wasn't usually this bad. If that's the case this would be a regular stop for me also if I lived here.
The lines are shorter recently, which usually means bad news. And indeed today's selections were not up to past experiences. The prices are up... still cheap but you no longer feel like you're picking their pocket. Lo mai kai, which was $1.90 a year ago, is $2.35 today. (And they were sold out, at noon on a Sunday.)  The preps had a sameness to them. There's lots of pork in the cha siu bao but it's not especially interesting pork. The gow had tough skins and not enough flavor variety among three we tried. And lots of things were sold out or unavailable.The scallion pancake, at $1, is sill the best value and the best thing on the menu. With shorter lines, I might just hop off the 30 stockton, buy one, and catch the next bus. But for my broader dim sum needs I think I'll be looking elsewhere.
I recently heard about a place that serves pretty similar items that I know so well from my childhood in Hawaii. Things like manapua and pork hash, though, called different names up here. Well, one of my friends told me about a place here and said, "look for the line." Sure enough, when you're walking along Stockton in Chinatown, this will be the only place with a line...because the food is that good! They serve a ton of stuff for not a lot. We're talking dumplings for about a buck and noodles for not a lot as well. It's very affordable. The staff is interesting. No BS and pretty aggressively fast, so know what you want before to speak to someone or you'll get the eye roll. LOL I learned the hard way. Their baked manapua or Baked BBQ Pork bun for $1.20 is HUGE! It's so delicious, I really wanted to get more than one. It's filled with chunks of flavorful bbq pork. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and for the price, you can literally get more than one but no joke, one is filling enough. I also got the pork hash or Shui Mai, 3 pieces for $2.10. Another steal of a deal! Three gigantic dumplings filled with pork and shrimp. So good!! If you're in the area and looking for a really good dim sum/dumpling/manapua joint, go check them out. You will NOT be disappointed!
As we were staying one street off of the San Fran China town district,  I knew I would be in for some amazing dim sum and we hit the jackpot here!  With a perfect setup to service a large menu to a line of hungry guests in a fast orderly fashion,  we took our place in line and waited or turn.  I went for it all!   Pork,  shrimp,  Chinese donuts, you name it!  The prices are stated clearly and you are paying rock bottom prices for really great food!  My favorite was the pork steamed bun, I easily could have been happy with just a couple of those!  The shrimp dumplings were also really mouth wateringly delicious!  I would highly recommend making a quick stop in here.  It may not look like much from the street,  but you will be happy you did!
Stop #2 on my our DIY chinatown food tour brought us to Good Mong Kok Bakery. In hindsight, this was probably my favorite stop. I guess I really never had authentic Chinese food before and had no idea that they used bread. Well they do, and they use it in a very interesting way. Get yourself a BBQ pork Bao. It was really good! The bao is a sweet roll stuffed with meat. This isn't something you rip apart which the wifey and I learned the hard way as the BBQ almost spilled completely out as we were trying to share. The pork wasn't too fatty and the sweet, tangy BBQ sauce was perfect with the sweet bread exterior. We also got a chicken bao which honestly tasted more like pork than the pork did. I don't eat shrimp but the shrimp shumai was good too. I would highly recommend making this a must-stop if you come to chinatown. My wife and I came on a Thursday afternoon so we didn't have to wait on a line, but I can definitely see why there would be lines on the weekends. These places are cash only, but don't worry you could literally feed yourself for $3-$4. Gotta love chinatown!
THIS PLACE IS SO DELICIOUS!!!!! Some of the best dim sum I've ever had. Each item is much larger than what you would usually get out at the restaurants. My dumplings and buns were huge. Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), shu mai (pork meat dumpling thing), chive dumplings were amazing. The wrappers are so chewy, the meat is perfectly seasoned.. the har gow was bursting with shrimp. At about $2 for 3 large pieces, I'm sold. Everything was so tasty on its own, I didn't even need to use soy sauce for added flavor!The pork char siu steamed bun was good --- fluffy, slightly sweet bread and sweet bbq pork meat, but nothing extraordinary. The ladies work fast so you can just tell them what you want and they toss it all in a box.Seriously a delicious meal, much better than the $25 I paid for brunch.....
When in Chinatown this place is a must! I permanently have it bookmarked on Yelp so I can make a quick stop when I'm in the area!The bao's are the best I've had. The baked BBQ pork is full of meat. And not the fatty stuff, I'm talking tender pork full of flavor. Each bite provides a nice combination of the sweet soft bun and chunks of pork. The steamed chicken is equally as good if not better! Imagine that! I have yet to find a steamed bao that I liked but this place nailed it! They are huge and the flavor of the chicken and mushrooms are really enjoyable in every bite!The dumplings are really good too. I like the shark fin gau (I think that's what they call it) and just like the baos, they are huge. Not stuffed with that filler food either. Both the baos and dumplings look like they're on steroids compared to the nearby competition! This place always has a line but don't worry the staff know what they're doing and are fast and competent! They'll get you in and out and your order will be correct even when you don't know what you're ordering like me :) I just point away, but at this small shop you really can't go wrong with anything you try. Enjoy!
This place fills my criteria for an authentic dim sum place; cheap-ness, filling-ness and cash only! Came here around noon time and saw the line was out the door, though it moved rather quickly. Once inside, you have to know what you want from the get go, cause everything moves fast with the ladies. I ordered a bunch of  dim sum items (tho most of them have sold out by then). My fave was their har gaw and Siu mai...tasty and HUGE.Downside is beside not having most of their item just at noon, the cleanliness was questionable, found some weird spot on my bao(s) - so eat at your own risk! Overall, not a bad spot to try if you are into BIG and cheap authentic dim sum spot in SF chinatown.
Best Siu Mai in town. In any town, really. I don't quite get the satisfaction anywhere else but here. When I go to San Francisco, Chinatown is is about a 7 minute walk from my preferred hotel. The walk is manageable, and so is the line here. Know that there is always a line, anywhere from 15-25 heads at a time. So of course, when dropping off the luggage at the room, after freshening up, it's to Good Mong Kok Bakery, first thing. Seeing this small take out store front makes me so happy. Siu Mai and Har Gow are my usual orders. Har gow tends to run out quickly, no matter the time you go. You're lucky if a fresh batch comes out, like  I was. Each are priced at 3 for $2.10.  Now that's an affordable and satisfying meal. I usually eat 2 of each, so then it's really affordable now isn't it. Steamed pork buns are great here as well. $1.10 each, so warm, full of pork. But, the Har Gow though, damn. Unlike anything else. I try to go more than once a trip, and I either eat it upon walking out, or take it back to the room, or stroll around somewhere and munch. I always over order thinking it'd make for a great snack later, or drunk food much later. I must admit, it is no good when it's eaten much much later. Tastes funky, even when you aren't sober. Bear the line, order enough, eat right away! And don't ask for soy sauce, you don't need any for the contents itself is already full of flavor. And you'll probably get shit for it.

The guy that was in line behind us was a regular customer and said that the wait wasn't usually this bad. If that's the case this would be a regular stop for me also if I lived here.
The lines are shorter recently, which usually means bad news. And indeed today's selections were not up to past experiences. The prices are up... still cheap but you no longer feel like you're picking their pocket. Lo mai kai, which was $1.90 a year ago, is $2.35 today. (And they were sold out, at noon on a Sunday.)  The preps had a sameness to them. There's lots of pork in the cha siu bao but it's not especially interesting pork. The gow had tough skins and not enough flavor variety among three we tried. And lots of things were sold out or unavailable.The scallion pancake, at $1, is sill the best value and the best thing on the menu. With shorter lines, I might just hop off the 30 stockton, buy one, and catch the next bus. But for my broader dim sum needs I think I'll be looking elsewhere.
I recently heard about a place that serves pretty similar items that I know so well from my childhood in Hawaii. Things like manapua and pork hash, though, called different names up here. Well, one of my friends told me about a place here and said, "look for the line." Sure enough, when you're walking along Stockton in Chinatown, this will be the only place with a line...because the food is that good! They serve a ton of stuff for not a lot. We're talking dumplings for about a buck and noodles for not a lot as well. It's very affordable. The staff is interesting. No BS and pretty aggressively fast, so know what you want before to speak to someone or you'll get the eye roll. LOL I learned the hard way. Their baked manapua or Baked BBQ Pork bun for $1.20 is HUGE! It's so delicious, I really wanted to get more than one. It's filled with chunks of flavorful bbq pork. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and for the price, you can literally get more than one but no joke, one is filling enough. I also got the pork hash or Shui Mai, 3 pieces for $2.10. Another steal of a deal! Three gigantic dumplings filled with pork and shrimp. So good!! If you're in the area and looking for a really good dim sum/dumpling/manapua joint, go check them out. You will NOT be disappointed!
As we were staying one street off of the San Fran China town district,  I knew I would be in for some amazing dim sum and we hit the jackpot here!  With a perfect setup to service a large menu to a line of hungry guests in a fast orderly fashion,  we took our place in line and waited or turn.  I went for it all!   Pork,  shrimp,  Chinese donuts, you name it!  The prices are stated clearly and you are paying rock bottom prices for really great food!  My favorite was the pork steamed bun, I easily could have been happy with just a couple of those!  The shrimp dumplings were also really mouth wateringly delicious!  I would highly recommend making a quick stop in here.  It may not look like much from the street,  but you will be happy you did!
Stop #2 on my our DIY chinatown food tour brought us to Good Mong Kok Bakery. In hindsight, this was probably my favorite stop. I guess I really never had authentic Chinese food before and had no idea that they used bread. Well they do, and they use it in a very interesting way. Get yourself a BBQ pork Bao. It was really good! The bao is a sweet roll stuffed with meat. This isn't something you rip apart which the wifey and I learned the hard way as the BBQ almost spilled completely out as we were trying to share. The pork wasn't too fatty and the sweet, tangy BBQ sauce was perfect with the sweet bread exterior. We also got a chicken bao which honestly tasted more like pork than the pork did. I don't eat shrimp but the shrimp shumai was good too. I would highly recommend making this a must-stop if you come to chinatown. My wife and I came on a Thursday afternoon so we didn't have to wait on a line, but I can definitely see why there would be lines on the weekends. These places are cash only, but don't worry you could literally feed yourself for $3-$4. Gotta love chinatown!
THIS PLACE IS SO DELICIOUS!!!!! Some of the best dim sum I've ever had. Each item is much larger than what you would usually get out at the restaurants. My dumplings and buns were huge. Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), shu mai (pork meat dumpling thing), chive dumplings were amazing. The wrappers are so chewy, the meat is perfectly seasoned.. the har gow was bursting with shrimp. At about $2 for 3 large pieces, I'm sold. Everything was so tasty on its own, I didn't even need to use soy sauce for added flavor!The pork char siu steamed bun was good --- fluffy, slightly sweet bread and sweet bbq pork meat, but nothing extraordinary. The ladies work fast so you can just tell them what you want and they toss it all in a box.Seriously a delicious meal, much better than the $25 I paid for brunch.....
When in Chinatown this place is a must! I permanently have it bookmarked on Yelp so I can make a quick stop when I'm in the area!The bao's are the best I've had. The baked BBQ pork is full of meat. And not the fatty stuff, I'm talking tender pork full of flavor. Each bite provides a nice combination of the sweet soft bun and chunks of pork. The steamed chicken is equally as good if not better! Imagine that! I have yet to find a steamed bao that I liked but this place nailed it! They are huge and the flavor of the chicken and mushrooms are really enjoyable in every bite!The dumplings are really good too. I like the shark fin gau (I think that's what they call it) and just like the baos, they are huge. Not stuffed with that filler food either. Both the baos and dumplings look like they're on steroids compared to the nearby competition! This place always has a line but don't worry the staff know what they're doing and are fast and competent! They'll get you in and out and your order will be correct even when you don't know what you're ordering like me :) I just point away, but at this small shop you really can't go wrong with anything you try. Enjoy!
This place fills my criteria for an authentic dim sum place; cheap-ness, filling-ness and cash only! Came here around noon time and saw the line was out the door, though it moved rather quickly. Once inside, you have to know what you want from the get go, cause everything moves fast with the ladies. I ordered a bunch of  dim sum items (tho most of them have sold out by then). My fave was their har gaw and Siu mai...tasty and HUGE.Downside is beside not having most of their item just at noon, the cleanliness was questionable, found some weird spot on my bao(s) - so eat at your own risk! Overall, not a bad spot to try if you are into BIG and cheap authentic dim sum spot in SF chinatown.
Best Siu Mai in town. In any town, really. I don't quite get the satisfaction anywhere else but here. When I go to San Francisco, Chinatown is is about a 7 minute walk from my preferred hotel. The walk is manageable, and so is the line here. Know that there is always a line, anywhere from 15-25 heads at a time. So of course, when dropping off the luggage at the room, after freshening up, it's to Good Mong Kok Bakery, first thing. Seeing this small take out store front makes me so happy. Siu Mai and Har Gow are my usual orders. Har gow tends to run out quickly, no matter the time you go. You're lucky if a fresh batch comes out, like  I was. Each are priced at 3 for $2.10.  Now that's an affordable and satisfying meal. I usually eat 2 of each, so then it's really affordable now isn't it. Steamed pork buns are great here as well. $1.10 each, so warm, full of pork. But, the Har Gow though, damn. Unlike anything else. I try to go more than once a trip, and I either eat it upon walking out, or take it back to the room, or stroll around somewhere and munch. I always over order thinking it'd make for a great snack later, or drunk food much later. I must admit, it is no good when it's eaten much much later. Tastes funky, even when you aren't sober. Bear the line, order enough, eat right away! And don't ask for soy sauce, you don't need any for the contents itself is already full of flavor. And you'll probably get shit for it.
Went a few hours out of my way to pick up $40 worth of dim sum goodness.Dollar-for-dollar, simply the best dim sum you can score (you wanna sit down and have it brought out to you on a cart: different conversation). Highly recommend the steamed pork buns, and my family went ape for the baked version. Also highly recommend the shark fin and shu mai. Don't waste your time on the peanut/chive dumpling, however (and this is coming from someone who loves both ingredients.
Great spot to get some good "ha gao" shrimp dumplings and shu Mai.  While we were there, spotted the "ma lie go" (Malaysian sponge cake).  $7.30 breakfast for two... Yummy, and satisfying without overstuffing ourselves.  Wish I live closer.... As NY doesn't have as good of "ha gao" and shu mai!
Aside from getting to watch how fortune cookies are made this dim sum place in Chinatown was well worth walking up and down the same streets to finally decide where to eat. That's the problem with Yelp, there are just too many choices (was only looking at the ones with 4 stars). I would definitely make this your dim sum to-go place. There isn't anywhere to sit down at (and I'm not going to take a star off for it) but they take credit card and that helped me to buy more and try so many different things. You meet the most interesting people in lines. While we were waiting in line for dim sum; which wasn't very long we lucked out, we met an older man who said he worked for Steve Jobs wife. But the most interesting thing about it is he never mentioned her name. He just kept referring to her as "Steve Jobs" wife. So I'm not sure if he really did or not. Any ways, back to the food...The man behind the counter spoke enough English to help me place my order. He was really nice and patient which I don't find often in Chinatown shops. He made an effort to describe which dumpling was what despite the language barrier. And he didn't get mad when I wanted to add more stuff to my order. He even recommend me trying the melon cake thingy and the egg yolk tart which I've always wanted to try but never have for whatever reason only that I didn't know what it was. The scallion pancake by far was the best. Not the typical pancake I'm used to but the flavor was so DELISH. It had this brushed salty dough glaze that just sealed the deal for me. The shrimp dumplings and the shrimp with scallion dumpling were right up on our yumminess scale. About $2.10 per serving of 3. Very clean looking and loaded with lots of shrimp. Two servings could me a meal. We also got a chicken or pork dumpling trio that looks like it's sitting in a little basket. Not sure what it's called but those were very meaty in size as well. I love steamed pork chao su bau and my hubby likes the baked so we got both. The pork wasn't dry and chewy tough like I've had from other places. Almost forgot the sesame bean paste balls that I have to always get. They're the size of racquet balls and have the perfect chewy texture. So if you're walking all around Chinatown trying to decide what Yelp location to go to like us then go here. You won't be disappointed and I hope you meet someone interesting in line.
I read about these places that people stand in line for in the big cities.   Stand in line? WTH are you talkin about?  1000's of restaurants to try that probably have NO waiting and you are the dummy standing in line for food?   This isn't Cold War Russia!  This is America!  Well actually it's Chinatown, which is in San Francisco, which ultimately IS technically in The United States of America.  So yeah...no waiting in line for this patriot!Well that is....unless....it's my last day in the city....and like...it's some Asian Holiday and my new friends really needed to try this place.  So yeah. 45 minute line?  No problem. I've done dim sum in the city before and loved it, this was no different.  This was good food.  Affordable and fresh and worth the wait.   I could not stop eating the shrimp ones.  Glad I only bought like 6 of those.  But we went for breakfast meal time and it lived up to its name.  Whatever that name actually means. I have no idea.  I doubt that when you head over, they will be selling bags and bags of stuff all at once.  So go in, and tell them that the white guy sent you....you know the one that looks just like all the other white guys?  Yeah him.
Ode to the (long) Sunday Morning Line:Delicious food, I will wait for thee (for 40 mins)I will strike a conversation with thy neighbor (bonus if they speak English)Look at Yelp for a pics/menu while in line (you have a 1 min window with staff to order)If all fails, yell frantically and point at a bunch of random stuff (everything is good anyway)It's busy, in a good way. The food is delicious and all the items are fresh as can be. I recommend everything, but if you need to pair that down, then try the bao (try one steamed and one baked), the zhong (sticky rice wrapped in leaves), and at least one sweet pastry item and one dim sum item. This will give you a well rounded taste of the menu. This is the type of bakery that makes a Chinatown shine, and should be visited when in town. It's one of the last to remain open while others have closed. BRING CASHHHHHHHH.
I've been struggling to write this review, as I don't know how to properly elaborate how good this food is and how much it means to me. I can't, so I'll just keep it short and sweet.Food: 5/5. Massive dim sum, with crazy explosive flavor. Don't even need soy sauce like other dim sum eateries. Be careful though as they sell out of things by early afternoon (har gow, some buns). Shu Mai is the greatest thing there. Price: ridiculously cheap. Ambience: slightly stressful ordering process with cramped quarters. No longer cash only, can use cards now!!!Overall: my favorite dim sum place on the planet. Deserves to be in its own tier, as it's way better than some of my other 5 star reviews. Best restaurant in Bay Area for me.
Truly amazing place!!! I paid $2.10 for 3 dumplings. I was so full from trying as many restaurants as I could in San Fran, but I could not pass this place up. It was a little hard to order as there was a bit of a language barrier. I just pointed to the ones that looked particularly good. I ended up with shrimp, shrimp and pork, and beef. All three were phenomenal. My absolute favorite was the shrimp though!!!  Ugh so good. Next time I'm in San Francisco I will absolutely be back!!
Good Mong Kok is one of the highest rated places on Yelp in San Francisco Chinatown. I enjoyed what I had, but I am 3 starring it because what I had didn't really blow my mind. I am definitely ignorant about what makes a great dim sum place, so know that before you trust my review. But on the whole, it was just ok to me. I had a pork bun which was really tasty, shrimp dumpling, and one other thing that I'm not entirely sure what it was. I told the girl shark fin, but she left off a couple things from my order, so who really know what was going on. The line was really long, and I went to another place down the street and couldn't really discern the difference between the two.
This is a great to-go spot for dim sum especially for the price and portions of the food. I thoroughly enjoyed everything, but some things I ordered were a tad too oily. All in all, a solid place to go for some dim sum!
If you are in Chinatown and need a quick snack, make sure you stop by Good Mong! Tasty, cheap, to go dim sum! Came on a Friday and expected a crazy line, but lucked out and there was only a few people.Service is quick, just tell them what you want and they get it ready for you. But make sure you know what you want so you don't stand there like a lost baby. They move fast!I was very surprised they take credit card. Shui Mai - $2.10 - Basic dim sum staple, comes with 3. Shrimp Dumpling - $2.10 - Har Gow, basic dim sum staple, comes with 3. Pan Fried Scallion Cake - $1 - Thick and chewy, with great green onion flavor. So cheap and so good!Steam BBQ Bun - $1.10 - Char Siu Bao. Ton of pictures of this, tasted like any bun you get at dim sum.Chicken Bun - $1.10 - I love chicken baos. Chicken baos are usually 3 times the size but this was a miniature version.
Had been meaning to try this place for years now, after hearing really good things about their shrimp dumplings (har gow). Having limited experience with dim sum in SF, I figured I would go with the most popular. In my experience, the better dim sum in NY/Philly is only experienced in parlors/sit-down restaurants, so the concept of straight-up dim sum stands was relatively new to me. I'd been to Wing Sing and Delicious Dim Sum, but friends kept telling me to go to Good Mong Kok. The line was still out the door when a few of us came to visit on a Saturday afternoon, which I took to be a good sign. Another good thing was that the line moved relatively fast, and we only waited outside for about 5 minutes. The dim sum was definitely impressive, both in flavor and in sheer size. The (huge) shrimp dumplings weren't greasy at all, and yet also not overly dry, and the shrimp inside was tender and flavorful. Didn't even need soy sauce. Shu mai was also hefty and delicious as well. I also tried one of their cha siu buns, which were absolutely enormous, and full of pork. The fried turnip cakes were delicious too, although those were actually a little on the greasier side, but still very filling. I liked that you could tell that they used actual turnips, as there was a considerable bit of texture in the cake. They also had sticky rice and a lot of other favorites, but I decided to not stuff myself silly, in the hopes of not putting myself into a coma for the rest of the day. Adult decisions, man.Service was pretty quick, and my non-Chinese-speaking friends were able to order without a hitch, as they do have the menu in English. I was also fairly impressed with how patient they were with people just perusing the menu. I think I'm too used to getting yelled at in Chinatown, ha. Prices were obviously incredibly cheap, with most dumplings at 3 for $2, and large buns for about $1-2. Definitely preferable to Wing Sing and Delicious Dim sum nearby, mostly because it's not as greasy, and because it's clean(er). Also, Delicious Dim Sum doesn't have anything in their menu in English, which can be a problem for some people. Without a question, I will be back at Good Mong Kok.
The line was unbearably slow and took a long time to navigate.  When I reached the end of the line I felt rushed.  I had no idea what some of the things I ordered were.  I was amazed at how little we paid for the amount of food we got.  Five stars!Welcome to the unforgettable experience that is Good Mong Kok Bakery.  My Yelp Community Director had listed this as a "1000% you must do this".  He's often right, except when it comes to iPads or Disney. We decided to walk here early on a Sunday morning.  We arrived at 8:15am and encountered a long line.  Wow, I wonder how bad the line gets later in the day.  To be honest the line took way longer than I expected. I had a flight to catch in a few hours.  I was starting to get antsy and thought about bailing at one point.  I'm glad I stayed though.  Forty five minutes after we got in line it was time to encounter the madness inside.  I would liken it to getting tossed into a tornado.  There are a lot of customers crammed inside.  There was little English spoken by the plethora of employees behind the counter rapidly moving around. The English descriptions on the wall were minimal at best, especially the one that just said "meat dumpling".  What exactly is that? As someone with a severe tree nut allergy I was more than a little concerned that I wouldn't know everything in my food based on the signage. I just crossed my fingers and hoped that the almond cookie was the only item with nuts in it. The first woman who helped me ran to the back room after I asked for a pineapple bun.  She was gone for so long I started questioning whether she was coming back. I eventually got helped by someone else.  I pointed to a few things, she threw them in a bag, and I was out the door for less than five bucks cost. The chicken bun I got was delicious and had a large serving of meat.  I couldn't even finish all of my shui mai because I got so full. The guy that was in line behind us was a regular customer and said that the wait wasn't usually this bad. If that's the case this would be a regular stop for me also if I lived here.

WTH are you talkin about?  1000's of restaurants to try that probably have NO waiting and you are the dummy standing in line for food?   This isn't Cold War Russia!  This is America!  Well actually it's Chinatown, which is in San Francisco, which ultimately IS technically in The United States of America.  So yeah...no waiting in line for this patriot!Well that is....unless....it's my last day in the city....and like...it's some Asian Holiday and my new friends really needed to try this place.  So yeah. 45 minute line?  No problem. I've done dim sum in the city before and loved it, this was no different.  This was good food.  Affordable and fresh and worth the wait.   I could not stop eating the shrimp ones.  Glad I only bought like 6 of those.  But we went for breakfast meal time and it lived up to its name.  Whatever that name actually means. I have no idea.  I doubt that when you head over, they will be selling bags and bags of stuff all at once.  So go in, and tell them that the white guy sent you....you know the one that looks just like all the other white guys?  Yeah him.
Ode to the (long) Sunday Morning Line:Delicious food, I will wait for thee (for 40 mins)I will strike a conversation with thy neighbor (bonus if they speak English)Look at Yelp for a pics/menu while in line (you have a 1 min window with staff to order)If all fails, yell frantically and point at a bunch of random stuff (everything is good anyway)It's busy, in a good way. The food is delicious and all the items are fresh as can be. I recommend everything, but if you need to pair that down, then try the bao (try one steamed and one baked), the zhong (sticky rice wrapped in leaves), and at least one sweet pastry item and one dim sum item. This will give you a well rounded taste of the menu. This is the type of bakery that makes a Chinatown shine, and should be visited when in town. It's one of the last to remain open while others have closed. BRING CASHHHHHHHH.
I've been struggling to write this review, as I don't know how to properly elaborate how good this food is and how much it means to me. I can't, so I'll just keep it short and sweet.Food: 5/5. Massive dim sum, with crazy explosive flavor. Don't even need soy sauce like other dim sum eateries. Be careful though as they sell out of things by early afternoon (har gow, some buns). Shu Mai is the greatest thing there. Price: ridiculously cheap. Ambience: slightly stressful ordering process with cramped quarters. No longer cash only, can use cards now!!!Overall: my favorite dim sum place on the planet. Deserves to be in its own tier, as it's way better than some of my other 5 star reviews. Best restaurant in Bay Area for me.
Truly amazing place!!! I paid $2.10 for 3 dumplings. I was so full from trying as many restaurants as I could in San Fran, but I could not pass this place up. It was a little hard to order as there was a bit of a language barrier. I just pointed to the ones that looked particularly good. I ended up with shrimp, shrimp and pork, and beef. All three were phenomenal. My absolute favorite was the shrimp though!!!  Ugh so good. Next time I'm in San Francisco I will absolutely be back!!
Good Mong Kok is one of the highest rated places on Yelp in San Francisco Chinatown. I enjoyed what I had, but I am 3 starring it because what I had didn't really blow my mind. I am definitely ignorant about what makes a great dim sum place, so know that before you trust my review. But on the whole, it was just ok to me. I had a pork bun which was really tasty, shrimp dumpling, and one other thing that I'm not entirely sure what it was. I told the girl shark fin, but she left off a couple things from my order, so who really know what was going on. The line was really long, and I went to another place down the street and couldn't really discern the difference between the two.
This is a great to-go spot for dim sum especially for the price and portions of the food. I thoroughly enjoyed everything, but some things I ordered were a tad too oily. All in all, a solid place to go for some dim sum!
If you are in Chinatown and need a quick snack, make sure you stop by Good Mong! Tasty, cheap, to go dim sum! Came on a Friday and expected a crazy line, but lucked out and there was only a few people.Service is quick, just tell them what you want and they get it ready for you. But make sure you know what you want so you don't stand there like a lost baby. They move fast!I was very surprised they take credit card. Shui Mai - $2.10 - Basic dim sum staple, comes with 3. Shrimp Dumpling - $2.10 - Har Gow, basic dim sum staple, comes with 3. Pan Fried Scallion Cake - $1 - Thick and chewy, with great green onion flavor. So cheap and so good!Steam BBQ Bun - $1.10 - Char Siu Bao. Ton of pictures of this, tasted like any bun you get at dim sum.Chicken Bun - $1.10 - I love chicken baos. Chicken baos are usually 3 times the size but this was a miniature version.
Had been meaning to try this place for years now, after hearing really good things about their shrimp dumplings (har gow). Having limited experience with dim sum in SF, I figured I would go with the most popular. In my experience, the better dim sum in NY/Philly is only experienced in parlors/sit-down restaurants, so the concept of straight-up dim sum stands was relatively new to me. I'd been to Wing Sing and Delicious Dim Sum, but friends kept telling me to go to Good Mong Kok. The line was still out the door when a few of us came to visit on a Saturday afternoon, which I took to be a good sign. Another good thing was that the line moved relatively fast, and we only waited outside for about 5 minutes. The dim sum was definitely impressive, both in flavor and in sheer size. The (huge) shrimp dumplings weren't greasy at all, and yet also not overly dry, and the shrimp inside was tender and flavorful. Didn't even need soy sauce. Shu mai was also hefty and delicious as well. I also tried one of their cha siu buns, which were absolutely enormous, and full of pork. The fried turnip cakes were delicious too, although those were actually a little on the greasier side, but still very filling. I liked that you could tell that they used actual turnips, as there was a considerable bit of texture in the cake. They also had sticky rice and a lot of other favorites, but I decided to not stuff myself silly, in the hopes of not putting myself into a coma for the rest of the day. Adult decisions, man.Service was pretty quick, and my non-Chinese-speaking friends were able to order without a hitch, as they do have the menu in English. I was also fairly impressed with how patient they were with people just perusing the menu. I think I'm too used to getting yelled at in Chinatown, ha. Prices were obviously incredibly cheap, with most dumplings at 3 for $2, and large buns for about $1-2. Definitely preferable to Wing Sing and Delicious Dim sum nearby, mostly because it's not as greasy, and because it's clean(er). Also, Delicious Dim Sum doesn't have anything in their menu in English, which can be a problem for some people. Without a question, I will be back at Good Mong Kok.
The line was unbearably slow and took a long time to navigate.  When I reached the end of the line I felt rushed.  I had no idea what some of the things I ordered were.  I was amazed at how little we paid for the amount of food we got.  Five stars!Welcome to the unforgettable experience that is Good Mong Kok Bakery.  My Yelp Community Director had listed this as a "1000% you must do this".  He's often right, except when it comes to iPads or Disney. We decided to walk here early on a Sunday morning.  We arrived at 8:15am and encountered a long line.  Wow, I wonder how bad the line gets later in the day.  To be honest the line took way longer than I expected. I had a flight to catch in a few hours.  I was starting to get antsy and thought about bailing at one point.  I'm glad I stayed though.  Forty five minutes after we got in line it was time to encounter the madness inside.  I would liken it to getting tossed into a tornado.  There are a lot of customers crammed inside.  There was little English spoken by the plethora of employees behind the counter rapidly moving around. The English descriptions on the wall were minimal at best, especially the one that just said "meat dumpling".  What exactly is that? As someone with a severe tree nut allergy I was more than a little concerned that I wouldn't know everything in my food based on the signage. I just crossed my fingers and hoped that the almond cookie was the only item with nuts in it. The first woman who helped me ran to the back room after I asked for a pineapple bun.  She was gone for so long I started questioning whether she was coming back. I eventually got helped by someone else.  I pointed to a few things, she threw them in a bag, and I was out the door for less than five bucks cost. The chicken bun I got was delicious and had a large serving of meat.  I couldn't even finish all of my shui mai because I got so full. The guy that was in line behind us was a regular customer and said that the wait wasn't usually this bad. If that's the case this would be a regular stop for me also if I lived here.
The lines are shorter recently, which usually means bad news. And indeed today's selections were not up to past experiences. The prices are up... still cheap but you no longer feel like you're picking their pocket. Lo mai kai, which was $1.90 a year ago, is $2.35 today. (And they were sold out, at noon on a Sunday.)  The preps had a sameness to them. There's lots of pork in the cha siu bao but it's not especially interesting pork. The gow had tough skins and not enough flavor variety among three we tried. And lots of things were sold out or unavailable.The scallion pancake, at $1, is sill the best value and the best thing on the menu. With shorter lines, I might just hop off the 30 stockton, buy one, and catch the next bus. But for my broader dim sum needs I think I'll be looking elsewhere.
I recently heard about a place that serves pretty similar items that I know so well from my childhood in Hawaii. Things like manapua and pork hash, though, called different names up here. Well, one of my friends told me about a place here and said, "look for the line." Sure enough, when you're walking along Stockton in Chinatown, this will be the only place with a line...because the food is that good! They serve a ton of stuff for not a lot. We're talking dumplings for about a buck and noodles for not a lot as well. It's very affordable. The staff is interesting. No BS and pretty aggressively fast, so know what you want before to speak to someone or you'll get the eye roll. LOL I learned the hard way. Their baked manapua or Baked BBQ Pork bun for $1.20 is HUGE! It's so delicious, I really wanted to get more than one. It's filled with chunks of flavorful bbq pork. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and for the price, you can literally get more than one but no joke, one is filling enough. I also got the pork hash or Shui Mai, 3 pieces for $2.10. Another steal of a deal! Three gigantic dumplings filled with pork and shrimp. So good!! If you're in the area and looking for a really good dim sum/dumpling/manapua joint, go check them out. You will NOT be disappointed!
As we were staying one street off of the San Fran China town district,  I knew I would be in for some amazing dim sum and we hit the jackpot here!  With a perfect setup to service a large menu to a line of hungry guests in a fast orderly fashion,  we took our place in line and waited or turn.  I went for it all!   Pork,  shrimp,  Chinese donuts, you name it!  The prices are stated clearly and you are paying rock bottom prices for really great food!  My favorite was the pork steamed bun, I easily could have been happy with just a couple of those!  The shrimp dumplings were also really mouth wateringly delicious!  I would highly recommend making a quick stop in here.  It may not look like much from the street,  but you will be happy you did!
Stop #2 on my our DIY chinatown food tour brought us to Good Mong Kok Bakery. In hindsight, this was probably my favorite stop. I guess I really never had authentic Chinese food before and had no idea that they used bread. Well they do, and they use it in a very interesting way. Get yourself a BBQ pork Bao. It was really good! The bao is a sweet roll stuffed with meat. This isn't something you rip apart which the wifey and I learned the hard way as the BBQ almost spilled completely out as we were trying to share. The pork wasn't too fatty and the sweet, tangy BBQ sauce was perfect with the sweet bread exterior. We also got a chicken bao which honestly tasted more like pork than the pork did. I don't eat shrimp but the shrimp shumai was good too. I would highly recommend making this a must-stop if you come to chinatown. My wife and I came on a Thursday afternoon so we didn't have to wait on a line, but I can definitely see why there would be lines on the weekends. These places are cash only, but don't worry you could literally feed yourself for $3-$4. Gotta love chinatown!
THIS PLACE IS SO DELICIOUS!!!!! Some of the best dim sum I've ever had. Each item is much larger than what you would usually get out at the restaurants. My dumplings and buns were huge. Har Gow (shrimp dumplings), shu mai (pork meat dumpling thing), chive dumplings were amazing. The wrappers are so chewy, the meat is perfectly seasoned.. the har gow was bursting with shrimp. At about $2 for 3 large pieces, I'm sold. Everything was so tasty on its own, I didn't even need to use soy sauce for added flavor!The pork char siu steamed bun was good --- fluffy, slightly sweet bread and sweet bbq pork meat, but nothing extraordinary. The ladies work fast so you can just tell them what you want and they toss it all in a box.Seriously a delicious meal, much better than the $25 I paid for brunch.....
When in Chinatown this place is a must! I permanently have it bookmarked on Yelp so I can make a quick stop when I'm in the area!The bao's are the best I've had. The baked BBQ pork is full of meat. And not the fatty stuff, I'm talking tender pork full of flavor. Each bite provides a nice combination of the sweet soft bun and chunks of pork. The steamed chicken is equally as good if not better! Imagine that! I have yet to find a steamed bao that I liked but this place nailed it! They are huge and the flavor of the chicken and mushrooms are really enjoyable in every bite!The dumplings are really good too. I like the shark fin gau (I think that's what they call it) and just like the baos, they are huge. Not stuffed with that filler food either. Both the baos and dumplings look like they're on steroids compared to the nearby competition! This place always has a line but don't worry the staff know what they're doing and are fast and competent! They'll get you in and out and your order will be correct even when you don't know what you're ordering like me :) I just point away, but at this small shop you really can't go wrong with anything you try. Enjoy!
This place fills my criteria for an authentic dim sum place; cheap-ness, filling-ness and cash only! Came here around noon time and saw the line was out the door, though it moved rather quickly. Once inside, you have to know what you want from the get go, cause everything moves fast with the ladies. I ordered a bunch of  dim sum items (tho most of them have sold out by then). My fave was their har gaw and Siu mai...tasty and HUGE.Downside is beside not having most of their item just at noon, the cleanliness was questionable, found some weird spot on my bao(s) - so eat at your own risk! Overall, not a bad spot to try if you are into BIG and cheap authentic dim sum spot in SF chinatown.
Best Siu Mai in town. In any town, really. I don't quite get the satisfaction anywhere else but here. When I go to San Francisco, Chinatown is is about a 7 minute walk from my preferred hotel. The walk is manageable, and so is the line here. Know that there is always a line, anywhere from 15-25 heads at a time. So of course, when dropping off the luggage at the room, after freshening up, it's to Good Mong Kok Bakery, first thing. Seeing this small take out store front makes me so happy. Siu Mai and Har Gow are my usual orders. Har gow tends to run out quickly, no matter the time you go. You're lucky if a fresh batch comes out, like  I was. Each are priced at 3 for $2.10.  Now that's an affordable and satisfying meal. I usually eat 2 of each, so then it's really affordable now isn't it. Steamed pork buns are great here as well. $1.10 each, so warm, full of pork. But, the Har Gow though, damn. Unlike anything else. I try to go more than once a trip, and I either eat it upon walking out, or take it back to the room, or stroll around somewhere and munch. I always over order thinking it'd make for a great snack later, or drunk food much later. I must admit, it is no good when it's eaten much much later. Tastes funky, even when you aren't sober. Bear the line, order enough, eat right away! And don't ask for soy sauce, you don't need any for the contents itself is already full of flavor. And you'll probably get shit for it.
