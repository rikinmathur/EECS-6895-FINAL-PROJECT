I'm here on vacation to visit friends, and this came highly recommended. I ordered the el pastor burrito. I had middle-of-the-road expectations because a burrito is a burrito is a burrito...like tacos. Food is made to order so you'll be waiting a bit, in addition to the wait in line. The line was about 8 people and it took about 15 minutes for me to get my order in. There is very little space to wait so you're crowded with the people in line and those waiting for their food. They have a 2-salsa bar where you can help yourself to sauces to go. Got the burrito home. When I opened it, it was larger and heavier than I thought it would be. I took a large bite...I was whisked away into a burrito heaven that I never knew existed. Hands down best burrito I've ever had. The meat was marinated and flavorful. You could taste the spices in your mouth mixing with the rice and beans. It was soooo good! It was a simple burrito with big flavor. I highly recommend, just like the other few thousand reviewers.
Great place for fast, casual, nor-cal stye Mexican food. I would recommend getting anything with shrimp (taco, burrito, quesadilla). The shrimp here always tastes fresh and mixes well with the other fresh ingredients.If you have a big appetite I would recommend the shrimp and steak super burrito. Everything else on the menu is great to with the exception of the torta (mexican sandwich) you have to go somewhere else for that. This location is bigger and less crowded than the one on 24th and Mission. Salsa bar is a definite plus.
Why are you Yelping this resteraunt?  Bookmark this spot, and or go there immediately.  There's only one thing to get here: The Super Carne Asada burrito.  I don't care what anyone else says.  This is the GOLD standard for Mission burritos.  Period.Stop reading this.  Go eat.
Another must while in SF, I really enjoyed their al pastor.Service was nice and they really work the crowds well.Best item here is the quesadilla, great value, tasty cheese and when you spruce it up with the salsa from their salsa bar you have a cheap and filling meal.The store is pretty small and run down, count on a long line and a hard time finding a place to sit.Cash only but they have an ATM around the corner, tasty treat while in SF.
Late night Mexican food anyone? Hanging around the Mission and looking for a bite? RIGHT HERE!CASH ONLYFriends were raving how great this place was and how it was a must-try, so we tried it! There is STILL a line at 9pm at night (late night munchies for everybody, I guess).LOCATION: Right next to the 24th St Mission BART station. Super convenient if you're taking the BART to/from and want to grab a bite.DINE-IN: A few tables lined up for dine-in and they will call your order # and bring it to your table. Self-serve waters right by the cashier. There is also salsa that you can fill up in little containers right by the cashier - get your salsa fix!You can also order to-go if you're in a rush or taking it back to nomz.LINE: There will probably be a line when you get here (or maybe there won't be and you're lucky). The line moves pretty fast and you can see them make the food while you stand in line.FOOD: From quesadillas to burritos to tacos to whatever you can think of, you won't be disappointed! I ordered a Super Burrito - SOOOO FILLING! I saved half of it for the next day. Still tasted delicious as a leftover. The quesadillas looked amazing too (may have to try that next time around).
Al Pastor Super Burrito has certainly changed my perspective of El Farolito. The pork flavor really shined through and brought a great sense of comfort. I hear the chicken is even better so I will definitely be back to give that a shot as well. Portions continue to be massive and great for the price in comparison to La Taqueria My only gripe is that they don't spread the ingredients evenly across the burrito Overall ThoughtsSee you soon El Farolito!
This review is about 10 years overdue.Lines are long, food is worth the wait.Mexican food, Jalisco style. Let me assure you, your mauf will break. The food is like crack. You'll want more, even when you're not hungry anymore. It's that good.The green salsa, peppered with tiny avocado bits is the business.The veggie nachos are where it's at. My fave, and trust me, I've tried every taqueria in the Mission.Don't even look at the menu, just order the nachos. When a Mexican commands you to order the nachos, you shouldn't question it. Do it.
Where else does one go for food before a redeye but El Farolito?Brace yourself- It's chaotic and it'll take time to get your food. Know this, but don't let it stop you from going. Went around 8:30pm on a Sunday. Probably took about 30-40 minutes from the moment I stepped on line until I got my order. While I wasn't in much of a rush, those who were did not have a good time (a person ahead of me started screaming at the poor employees because she had yet to get her food... as if she was the only one waiting and as if the folks weren't working hard enough already). Luggage in tow in the small space, I was constantly in the way, but I persisted and patiently waited for what some consider the best Mexican food on either coast. Very glad I did. The wait is a bit tortuous as the line curves around the front window where you can see every order being made. It was fun to watch the production line- it was clear they know what they're doing and they do it well. Everything looked sinfully delicious. After much debate, I ordered a super burrito with carne asada. Generous portions of every single ingredient that work incredibly well together. You can taste every element -- the flavorful carne asada was enveloped by the perfectly seasoned rice and beans, held together by huge chunks of avocado (each burrito gets at least a half an avocado), cheese, and sour cream. Three or four servings easily (or one, if drunk). I swear it was the size of a large child.Cash only. Know your order when it's your turn. Grab a number (in the meantime, get yourself some salsa/guac- it's self serve), and wait until your number is called. It's like the lottery, except you always win.
Famous for their burritos and quesadillas, you'll have to squeeze through to get you're order. Be prepared to bus your own table as well. Their food was delicious and filling and I definitely recommend you try it at least once, but the dining experience leaves a lot to be desired. This is a CASH ONLY establishment. Take out is the way to go with this joint
I grew up in San Francisco and when I first had this, I was thinking to myself, where have you been all my life. Probably because I don't hang out in the Mission too often. WOW it was amazing. I got their **SUPER BURRITO with Carne Asada. It's FREAKEN amazing! So much flavor. Made with soft flour tortilla prepared with rice beans (I ALWAYS say without, extra rice instead), fresh, tomato, onion, cilantro, salsa, cheese sour cream and avocado. It was 2am when I had it the first time. But I went back during the day and it was still as DELICIOUS as I remember! The only bad thing is that its pretty dirty, I mean that homeless comes in and out. I just take it and go. Fast services. Eat it somewhere else.
There wasn't a wow factor for me when I ate it here, but I must say that their burritos were huge!The line and the wait weren't bad at all. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and it came out in about 10 minutes. The only thing I thought about my burritos was that there was way too much rice in my burrito and not enough meat.There's some sauce near the register to pour on your food. I tried two of the three and I thought the spicier salsa tasted great on my burrito.Good bang for your buck.
I love tacos. I love late night taco joints. I love El Farolito. Their tacos are warm and piping, their salsa is fresh and acidic, and it's a good price for your wallet.The only downside: it gets crowded so the line gets long and there aren't too many places to sit. Also, make sure you bring cash! There's an ATM outside but they do charge you.
Finally got to try it!! I was really excited for some El Farolito when I visited SF. It just seemed like such delicious drunk food. And I'm sure it is, but I wasn't even that drunk anymore when I got here. It was around 1AM or so and the line was out the door... apparently that's typical so good for you El Farolito.My friend suggested the shrimp & steak burrito, and I asked for NO BEANS.... but got some anyway. BOO. If there were no beans, it might have been a LOT better. I don't like beans lol (with exceptions of course). But honestly it was still delicious. I forgot which salsas I got, but I liked the spicy one... as always. Dump some on your burrito and mMMMMMM. The shrimps were surprisingly huge and plump with a nice bite to em. I've only had one other shrimp burrito before lol and maybe I should be hitting those more often! The steak wasn't even necessary I thought lol. Delicious overall though.Also.... you can probably share lol. It's a huge ass burrito, and I think it cost like 12 something bucks! Maybe that's because it's steak and shrimp (the fancier meats oOoO), but in SoCal that seems a little overpriced. I mean.. totally worth it for the size, but I can't finish it lol.BOMB (drunk or regular) food for sure. Would come back. Hopefully be drunker next time so I can enjoy my burrito in all its glorious .... glory.
This is one of the best tacos I've ever had!! I ordered two tacos (marinated pork and chicken) and I already knew it would be awesome when I opened it. And yes I was right!! That first bite made me really happy because all the flavors were just bursting out and it was just reallyyyyy delicious. I absolutely loved this place. I highly recommend it to everyone, do not miss out!
I got to meet up with a friend I have not literally seen in years.  With that being said, when we met up, she had suggested we go get some food. This is where we ended up.  I had nto ever heard of this place before, but when she told me what it was about, my mouth ended up watering.First of all, let me warn you- the parking here is beyond a joke.  On a weeknight, it isn't so bad.  On a weekday, good luck- they have some traffic prick blocking off the area and then you are screwed.  i think you are better off taking a cab, walking, or dropping in via parachute.  This alone is what prevented me from giving this place 5 stars.There was some scaffolding out front so be careful what store you enter.  We were lead in by the line and the smells of cooked meats.  I had no idea what to get or what to expect so I told her I will eat whatever she was eating.  She told me that the burritos here were some of the best in the nation.  I was looking forward to it.  Also she said they were big.  Coming from a man who puts 2-3 Qdoba burritos down at once, I had high expectations.This place was cash only, but 2 burritos and 2 drinks didn't even cost $20.  Nice value!  The place is narrow, so you have to be aggressive in terms of looking for a table.  Thankfully we got one right up front.A few minutes later our food was ready.  It was a great time, catching up, and trying these humungo burritos.  I liked mine a lot.  I didn't even put salsa on it- I just scarfed it.  I still don't even know what I ate that night- except it was large, filling, and tasty.It was good enough I tried going back a few days later in the daytime for lunch.  And then that traffic nerd virgin prevented from getting me to my final destination.  How dare you get in the way of my food.  I really wanted El Farolito that day for lunch, not McDonalds.If you are unfamiliar with this place, give it a shot.  Hell, if I wasn't staying in Concord at the moment writing Yelp reviews I would probably be on my way now to get another one of those burritos I have no idea what was in it.It was good enough I didn't even get a picture of it...
Best burrito of my life. Get the carne asada super burrito. It is tasty with perfectly cooked steak. This place isn't much to look at when you walk in, but what it lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for in taste. This thing is huge! Definitely two meals worth, or in my case, one meal and I didn't eat again until breakfast the next day.Visit El Farolito when you're in the Mission District in San Francisco. It's right off the 24th/Mission BART stop. Super convenient.
The super burrito was very large. The pork was crispy, tender, and flavourful. The avocado was at the perfect ripeness. The tortillas were fresh and the rice was soft but not mushy. They have a variety of self serve salsas to choose from. Even though there were a lot of toppings, you could still taste the creaminess of the sour cream. Overall, it was a fantastic burrito.
El Farolito is definitely a gem of San Francisco and lives up to the hype. After many night outs in the city, this was my first time surprisingly at El Farolitio. My impression of this place is the definition of divey (hole in the wall, small restaurant) and it is great that it is open late at night. This is also cash only place. I could imagine this place being a 'go to' spot after hitting the bars or clubbing. My friend and I went here late at night after a concert, there was still a good amount of people here. You don't come here for the cleanliness, you come here for the food. I had the Al Pastor Super Burrito and my friend got the quesadilla, and both were huge! It was so big that I saved some for the next day and ate it for breakfast and lunch. It also so good that I didn't really need to add sauce. I highly recommend this place if you are a foodie and have a love for mexican food. El Farolito will be the first thing that comes to mind after a night out in the city.
In the middle of the Mission District is an oasis. And it serves chips and salsa. While there are countless bars around the district, El Farolito is the area's main watering hole if you will and I promise you, it's not a mirage. El Farolito has 4 Yelp stars because it's affordable, the portions are large, and the food tastes amazing. Tip: Boba Guy's is right down the street and I'm in love with their balls. But they close their legs..doors..at 9 so keep that in mind.
I really love the Super Quesadilla Suiza with carnitas. The meat is juicy and flavorful and the quesadilla is plump and filling. For about $8, it's fairly priced for SF.That said, El Farolito is so dirty that even Yi Z., a girl who once lived in a third world country, finds it unbearable at times. Due to the volume of customers at night, you have to stalk other patrons to get a table that is never cleaned. Ladies, do not put your purse down either. When I thought it couldn't get any dirtier, I headed to the restroom and I was blown away (not in a positive way). I definitely regretted not using the restroom at the dive bar we were at earlier.There must be other good Mexican places nearby. I'm tired of waiting in a long line in the cold SF wind for this experience.

There is also salsa that you can fill up in little containers right by the cashier - get your salsa fix!You can also order to-go if you're in a rush or taking it back to nomz.LINE: There will probably be a line when you get here (or maybe there won't be and you're lucky). The line moves pretty fast and you can see them make the food while you stand in line.FOOD: From quesadillas to burritos to tacos to whatever you can think of, you won't be disappointed! I ordered a Super Burrito - SOOOO FILLING! I saved half of it for the next day. Still tasted delicious as a leftover. The quesadillas looked amazing too (may have to try that next time around).
Al Pastor Super Burrito has certainly changed my perspective of El Farolito. The pork flavor really shined through and brought a great sense of comfort. I hear the chicken is even better so I will definitely be back to give that a shot as well. Portions continue to be massive and great for the price in comparison to La Taqueria My only gripe is that they don't spread the ingredients evenly across the burrito Overall ThoughtsSee you soon El Farolito!
This review is about 10 years overdue.Lines are long, food is worth the wait.Mexican food, Jalisco style. Let me assure you, your mauf will break. The food is like crack. You'll want more, even when you're not hungry anymore. It's that good.The green salsa, peppered with tiny avocado bits is the business.The veggie nachos are where it's at. My fave, and trust me, I've tried every taqueria in the Mission.Don't even look at the menu, just order the nachos. When a Mexican commands you to order the nachos, you shouldn't question it. Do it.
Where else does one go for food before a redeye but El Farolito?Brace yourself- It's chaotic and it'll take time to get your food. Know this, but don't let it stop you from going. Went around 8:30pm on a Sunday. Probably took about 30-40 minutes from the moment I stepped on line until I got my order. While I wasn't in much of a rush, those who were did not have a good time (a person ahead of me started screaming at the poor employees because she had yet to get her food... as if she was the only one waiting and as if the folks weren't working hard enough already). Luggage in tow in the small space, I was constantly in the way, but I persisted and patiently waited for what some consider the best Mexican food on either coast. Very glad I did. The wait is a bit tortuous as the line curves around the front window where you can see every order being made. It was fun to watch the production line- it was clear they know what they're doing and they do it well. Everything looked sinfully delicious. After much debate, I ordered a super burrito with carne asada. Generous portions of every single ingredient that work incredibly well together. You can taste every element -- the flavorful carne asada was enveloped by the perfectly seasoned rice and beans, held together by huge chunks of avocado (each burrito gets at least a half an avocado), cheese, and sour cream. Three or four servings easily (or one, if drunk). I swear it was the size of a large child.Cash only. Know your order when it's your turn. Grab a number (in the meantime, get yourself some salsa/guac- it's self serve), and wait until your number is called. It's like the lottery, except you always win.
Famous for their burritos and quesadillas, you'll have to squeeze through to get you're order. Be prepared to bus your own table as well. Their food was delicious and filling and I definitely recommend you try it at least once, but the dining experience leaves a lot to be desired. This is a CASH ONLY establishment. Take out is the way to go with this joint
I grew up in San Francisco and when I first had this, I was thinking to myself, where have you been all my life. Probably because I don't hang out in the Mission too often. WOW it was amazing. I got their **SUPER BURRITO with Carne Asada. It's FREAKEN amazing! So much flavor. Made with soft flour tortilla prepared with rice beans (I ALWAYS say without, extra rice instead), fresh, tomato, onion, cilantro, salsa, cheese sour cream and avocado. It was 2am when I had it the first time. But I went back during the day and it was still as DELICIOUS as I remember! The only bad thing is that its pretty dirty, I mean that homeless comes in and out. I just take it and go. Fast services. Eat it somewhere else.
There wasn't a wow factor for me when I ate it here, but I must say that their burritos were huge!The line and the wait weren't bad at all. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and it came out in about 10 minutes. The only thing I thought about my burritos was that there was way too much rice in my burrito and not enough meat.There's some sauce near the register to pour on your food. I tried two of the three and I thought the spicier salsa tasted great on my burrito.Good bang for your buck.
I love tacos. I love late night taco joints. I love El Farolito. Their tacos are warm and piping, their salsa is fresh and acidic, and it's a good price for your wallet.The only downside: it gets crowded so the line gets long and there aren't too many places to sit. Also, make sure you bring cash! There's an ATM outside but they do charge you.
Finally got to try it!! I was really excited for some El Farolito when I visited SF. It just seemed like such delicious drunk food. And I'm sure it is, but I wasn't even that drunk anymore when I got here. It was around 1AM or so and the line was out the door... apparently that's typical so good for you El Farolito.My friend suggested the shrimp & steak burrito, and I asked for NO BEANS.... but got some anyway. BOO. If there were no beans, it might have been a LOT better. I don't like beans lol (with exceptions of course). But honestly it was still delicious. I forgot which salsas I got, but I liked the spicy one... as always. Dump some on your burrito and mMMMMMM. The shrimps were surprisingly huge and plump with a nice bite to em. I've only had one other shrimp burrito before lol and maybe I should be hitting those more often! The steak wasn't even necessary I thought lol. Delicious overall though.Also.... you can probably share lol. It's a huge ass burrito, and I think it cost like 12 something bucks! Maybe that's because it's steak and shrimp (the fancier meats oOoO), but in SoCal that seems a little overpriced. I mean.. totally worth it for the size, but I can't finish it lol.BOMB (drunk or regular) food for sure. Would come back. Hopefully be drunker next time so I can enjoy my burrito in all its glorious .... glory.
This is one of the best tacos I've ever had!! I ordered two tacos (marinated pork and chicken) and I already knew it would be awesome when I opened it. And yes I was right!! That first bite made me really happy because all the flavors were just bursting out and it was just reallyyyyy delicious. I absolutely loved this place. I highly recommend it to everyone, do not miss out!
I got to meet up with a friend I have not literally seen in years.  With that being said, when we met up, she had suggested we go get some food. This is where we ended up.  I had nto ever heard of this place before, but when she told me what it was about, my mouth ended up watering.First of all, let me warn you- the parking here is beyond a joke.  On a weeknight, it isn't so bad.  On a weekday, good luck- they have some traffic prick blocking off the area and then you are screwed.  i think you are better off taking a cab, walking, or dropping in via parachute.  This alone is what prevented me from giving this place 5 stars.There was some scaffolding out front so be careful what store you enter.  We were lead in by the line and the smells of cooked meats.  I had no idea what to get or what to expect so I told her I will eat whatever she was eating.  She told me that the burritos here were some of the best in the nation.  I was looking forward to it.  Also she said they were big.  Coming from a man who puts 2-3 Qdoba burritos down at once, I had high expectations.This place was cash only, but 2 burritos and 2 drinks didn't even cost $20.  Nice value!  The place is narrow, so you have to be aggressive in terms of looking for a table.  Thankfully we got one right up front.A few minutes later our food was ready.  It was a great time, catching up, and trying these humungo burritos.  I liked mine a lot.  I didn't even put salsa on it- I just scarfed it.  I still don't even know what I ate that night- except it was large, filling, and tasty.It was good enough I tried going back a few days later in the daytime for lunch.  And then that traffic nerd virgin prevented from getting me to my final destination.  How dare you get in the way of my food.  I really wanted El Farolito that day for lunch, not McDonalds.If you are unfamiliar with this place, give it a shot.  Hell, if I wasn't staying in Concord at the moment writing Yelp reviews I would probably be on my way now to get another one of those burritos I have no idea what was in it.It was good enough I didn't even get a picture of it...
Best burrito of my life. Get the carne asada super burrito. It is tasty with perfectly cooked steak. This place isn't much to look at when you walk in, but what it lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for in taste. This thing is huge! Definitely two meals worth, or in my case, one meal and I didn't eat again until breakfast the next day.Visit El Farolito when you're in the Mission District in San Francisco. It's right off the 24th/Mission BART stop. Super convenient.
The super burrito was very large. The pork was crispy, tender, and flavourful. The avocado was at the perfect ripeness. The tortillas were fresh and the rice was soft but not mushy. They have a variety of self serve salsas to choose from. Even though there were a lot of toppings, you could still taste the creaminess of the sour cream. Overall, it was a fantastic burrito.
El Farolito is definitely a gem of San Francisco and lives up to the hype. After many night outs in the city, this was my first time surprisingly at El Farolitio. My impression of this place is the definition of divey (hole in the wall, small restaurant) and it is great that it is open late at night. This is also cash only place. I could imagine this place being a 'go to' spot after hitting the bars or clubbing. My friend and I went here late at night after a concert, there was still a good amount of people here. You don't come here for the cleanliness, you come here for the food. I had the Al Pastor Super Burrito and my friend got the quesadilla, and both were huge! It was so big that I saved some for the next day and ate it for breakfast and lunch. It also so good that I didn't really need to add sauce. I highly recommend this place if you are a foodie and have a love for mexican food. El Farolito will be the first thing that comes to mind after a night out in the city.
In the middle of the Mission District is an oasis. And it serves chips and salsa. While there are countless bars around the district, El Farolito is the area's main watering hole if you will and I promise you, it's not a mirage. El Farolito has 4 Yelp stars because it's affordable, the portions are large, and the food tastes amazing. Tip: Boba Guy's is right down the street and I'm in love with their balls. But they close their legs..doors..at 9 so keep that in mind.
I really love the Super Quesadilla Suiza with carnitas. The meat is juicy and flavorful and the quesadilla is plump and filling. For about $8, it's fairly priced for SF.That said, El Farolito is so dirty that even Yi Z., a girl who once lived in a third world country, finds it unbearable at times. Due to the volume of customers at night, you have to stalk other patrons to get a table that is never cleaned. Ladies, do not put your purse down either. When I thought it couldn't get any dirtier, I headed to the restroom and I was blown away (not in a positive way). I definitely regretted not using the restroom at the dive bar we were at earlier.There must be other good Mexican places nearby. I'm tired of waiting in a long line in the cold SF wind for this experience.
I'm here on vacation to visit friends, and this came highly recommended. I ordered the el pastor burrito. I had middle-of-the-road expectations because a burrito is a burrito is a burrito...like tacos. Food is made to order so you'll be waiting a bit, in addition to the wait in line. The line was about 8 people and it took about 15 minutes for me to get my order in. There is very little space to wait so you're crowded with the people in line and those waiting for their food. They have a 2-salsa bar where you can help yourself to sauces to go. Got the burrito home. When I opened it, it was larger and heavier than I thought it would be. I took a large bite...I was whisked away into a burrito heaven that I never knew existed. Hands down best burrito I've ever had. The meat was marinated and flavorful. You could taste the spices in your mouth mixing with the rice and beans. It was soooo good! It was a simple burrito with big flavor. I highly recommend, just like the other few thousand reviewers.
Great place for fast, casual, nor-cal stye Mexican food. I would recommend getting anything with shrimp (taco, burrito, quesadilla). The shrimp here always tastes fresh and mixes well with the other fresh ingredients.If you have a big appetite I would recommend the shrimp and steak super burrito. Everything else on the menu is great to with the exception of the torta (mexican sandwich) you have to go somewhere else for that. This location is bigger and less crowded than the one on 24th and Mission. Salsa bar is a definite plus.
Why are you Yelping this resteraunt?  Bookmark this spot, and or go there immediately.  There's only one thing to get here: The Super Carne Asada burrito.  I don't care what anyone else says.  This is the GOLD standard for Mission burritos.  Period.Stop reading this.  Go eat.
Another must while in SF, I really enjoyed their al pastor.Service was nice and they really work the crowds well.Best item here is the quesadilla, great value, tasty cheese and when you spruce it up with the salsa from their salsa bar you have a cheap and filling meal.The store is pretty small and run down, count on a long line and a hard time finding a place to sit.Cash only but they have an ATM around the corner, tasty treat while in SF.
Late night Mexican food anyone? Hanging around the Mission and looking for a bite? RIGHT HERE!CASH ONLYFriends were raving how great this place was and how it was a must-try, so we tried it! There is STILL a line at 9pm at night (late night munchies for everybody, I guess).LOCATION: Right next to the 24th St Mission BART station. Super convenient if you're taking the BART to/from and want to grab a bite.DINE-IN: A few tables lined up for dine-in and they will call your order # and bring it to your table.
