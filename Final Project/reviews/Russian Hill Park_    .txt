It gets 5-Stars, because if you walk down Hyde from Lombard to The Bay, the view to your left is because there is a park/reservoir here.The view to the West is amazing.  It is pretty low, yet still elevated.  Very intimate as you see The Bay spread out before you.  I love the view of the GGB.  I love the Sunset, as you walk down to The Cannery.  I like this part of town, and, people should know about this view.The reservoir is farther up the hill.  There is also an open space down below.  Very close to Ghirardelli Square and the Aquatic Park.  It provides some good neighborhood space.Part of being in The City is understanding how many really special things you can come across living in San Francisco.  This is one of those special places.  Seeing the views of The Bay is a real experience.  I wish I could really put it into words.See it.  Write a review.
