Yum! The pork belly banh mi at Soapbox is the perfect lunch to kick off the weekend. Yes, the price keeps going up and up but only because it's worth it!The space is super cute but there's not that much sitting room so we usually end up calling in and picking up =)
My little daughter and I came in on a Saturday afternoon and had a blast! They have a small area filled with toys and crayons...I thought we were going to be in and out with take out but we ended up staying and loved it. Banh mi was delicious. I had the pork belly and will be back for more. The pickled carrots are perfect, and all ingredients are fresh. Daughter asked for more bread and when the employees saw that, they gave us a bag of all in the inner pieces of bread that they pull out!!  So thoughtful. My 1 year old ate more than I did lol. Thanks for the great experience!
This little cafe is SUPER chic and cute! It's on the corner of Vallejo and Hyde Streets in the Russian Hill neighborhood of SF. The windows let in a TON of natural light into the cafe, the door was open letting fresh air flow through, and the cable cars passes thru the frontside of the cafe -- making this such a nice spot for people watching.The staff is AMAZING! The mother-daughter team did a wonderful job in hiring really polite, attentive staff. They are friendly and can recommend the best items to order on the menu.My husband order the combo bahn mi -- #6 from the sandwiches list. The bread is baked fresh daily and toasted to perfection. You get a really nice, light crunch. The headcheese adds a nice crunch, the pork belly adds a juicy goodness, and the veggies makes the sandwich light and fresh.I ordered the pork and shrimp spring roll. These are made regularly throughout the day to ensure freshness. The sauce is really tasty. Add the peanuts and sriracha to the sauce if you want it to be extra yummy.We also had two Vietnamese coffee on ice. The made-to-order coffees are strong and rich. Great as an afternoon pick-me-up.Totally check out this place if you're up for something light, tasty, and delicious!
Cute banh mi place! Family run and local. Tbh, I've had better bahn mi's but these taste fresher/healthier, so maybe that's part of the reason. I'm adding a star because I want to support a local business.Pro tip: Fancy pork - not so fancy. Maybe more akin to fancy-feast (the cat food??)
This quiet Russian Hill street corner has been through so many different businesses. Now the new Vietnamese bakery and café has settled in to the area with what not many neighboring businesses in the area offer: Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi). On my debut, for dinner I ordered the Five-spiced chicken banh mi. For $4.75, which is reasonably priced, I get the grilled chicken meat with the standard shredded carrots, daikon, cucumbers, onions and cilantro in a customary warm roll. The chicken meat was cooked and spiced perfectly. But what is unique about the café's sandwich is the condiments are seasoned and grilled, which adds flavors and explosion to my taste buds. For now, new café only offer a limited menu. But once the café is situated, I hope they will offer more food items to excite the quiet Russian Hill neighborhood.
Want a damn good authentic Vietnamese sandwich? Look no further than this place. The tofu sandwich is by far my fave but the others are equally as tasty! Vermicelli bowls....bomb dot com! Spring rolls...dope! Vietnamese coffee...on point! Fizzy drinks...a must try!Really cute decor and very well kept. Clean all around. The owner is also super friendly and sweet. One of my fave new spots :)
Bahn mi was okay.  They give you lots of pickled carrots but hardly any meat.  90% pickled carrots and other veggies, 10% meat.
Finally, a cozy cafe in Russian Hill! This place really makes you feel warm and at home. Super friendly family that owns and runs it and the Banh Mi sandwiches are on point! The patê spread makes all the difference and the ingredients are all super fresh, to go along with the extremely clean and tidy feel of the place in general. I'll be back for the Vietnamese iced coffee and the company!
Strong coffee, delicious sandwich, spot clean store, and friendly staffs all in one place! Too bad they close early during weekdays.
How can you not love a quaint cafe that serves authentic Vietnamese sandwiches? I've tried a handful of Banh Mi spots in the city, and this one is definitely up there. Opt for the combo if you're adventurous.Bonus points: there's a tiny park across the street to the right. Perfect spot to sit down with your coffee and sandwich.
Nice venue.  It's a small, well put together space right on the cable car line. There are big windows, so it feels light and airy inside even though it's tiny.We had a lemon grass chicken banh mi, cold rolls ( pork and shrimp), hot vietnamese coffee, and a florentine/tuile-like cookie dipped in chocolate.I liked the banh mi fine. It had all of the necessary ingredients and the bread was super crunchy and perfect. Kid wanted it to have mayo too ( it didnt) and she still likes Saigon better. I thought it was pretty good, but could have used more chicken. I would get it again, though. It was tasty.I thought the cold rolls were fine, but not quite as flavorful as I wanted them to be. The coffee and cookie were perfection!!! Overall, a nice spot with good service and definitely worth a stop.Two minor quibbles:1. Why is it named 'soap box'? Nobody was expounding on anything there. Was it formerly a laundry? Soap and food don't mix....2. Tourists stare at you because they can due to the windows. I kind of felt like I was a gorilla at the zoo. Poor gorillas. There's a reason why I dont go to the zoo....
Adorable little Vietnamese sandwich cafe located right in the European village section of Nob Hill. Beautifully yet simply designed, love the vintage furniture blends with the the high ceilings and corner glass windows and jazz music. The sandwiches are definitely a bit more sophisticated than what you would find in the Tenderloin but no less authentic. Portions are average but lots of extra flavors via Maggi sauce and a dash of pepper really round out the profile of the combo sandwich. I'll be back to try the Vietnamese coffee when I'm up for some casual relaxation in the area.
Love! Super cute decor and just a very calm and peaceful atmosphere.There is not much seating inside but I came off peak hours and found a seat quickly.The food is fresh and delicious and there is a nice variety for a cafe.The Vietnamese Tea was amazing,the perfect amount of sweetness.
Finally tried this place for lunch today and it did NOT disappoint. After perusing the menu, we ordered the strawberry fizzie (homemade soda with fresh muddled strawberries-very refreshing with the right amount of sweetness), an order of the shrimp and pork spring rolls, the roasted pork banh mi and the lemongrass chicken banh mi. First of all, my SO and I were in agreement that the spring rolls were maybe some of the best we've ever had. Super simple but fresh ingredients and a delicious dipping sauce really makes all the difference. Both of our banh mis were delicious...great bread, tender meats and fresh veggies...what's not to love?! This cafe is super cute with friendly staff, delicious eats and it's maybe a 5-minute walk from our place which we're both pretty excited about.
Sprinklin' in a little variety on Hyde Street. I like it. 80 degree temps and a Friday afternoon, thought I'd treat myself to a refreshing lunch. Walked in and was pleasantly greeted, order was taken. Then begun the wait...Besides being on the slow side, the place kind of confused me. There are shelved books for sale, what looks like a kiddie corner - think children's games and toys plus a school-style seat, and then a random smattering of breakfast goods. Regardless, the bahn mi and spring roll options are just as you would select. Pork, chicken, tofu, shrimp. Really all you need! Opted for the roast pork sandwich and lemongrass chicken spring rolls. Not bad! Tasty, quality ingredients. Yup, I'll be back!
Time: 12:04pm/67°F partly sunnyPurpose: After a short soft opening stint they were close for unknown reasons. Going on a hunch, I swing by again. What do you know? They're open back! Ambiance: This corner location cafe is just what the neighborhood needs. Walking in you can feel good vibes and coziness before even seated. It feels homey and somewhat family oriented. Place begin with wooden L-shape counter line with all cafe essentials and supplies. Couple of round tables nestle against wall mounted box bench seater with cushion/pillows for added comfort. Wooden communal table with glass top sits six comfortably. Natural sun rays magnified through windows can burn your neckline. Depending on the strength of UV that day, it may or may not just be careful. Rest of place with wooden linoleum tiles, utensil station, single door beverage fridge, wooden bench and kid area. Decor are mostly wooden box crates with household items like books, glass ornaments and local SF artist crafts. Simple design nothing extravagant just enough to get message out.Staff: A girl about late 20s very friendly with Minnie mouse voice. Voice so soft, I can't hear her asking me what sandwich I wanted as, cable car bell echoe in doorway. So, I stood there looking at her thinking will she take my order? Then, it became apparent, I didn't hear her first time. She explain that their sandwiches are made differently than standard one. I ask how? She said meat are heated twice. Never in a rush to up sell or ask to buy. Her can do attitude prompted me be more relax instead of rsuhing my order.Cleanliness: Grade A, immaculate from counter to table. No complaints of what so ever. Health department paper posted in public view. There's not one trashbox seen. However, when you're done just leave on table and they'll bus when free. Eats/Drinks: Pork belly sandwich $4.75 and San Pellegrino $2. The bread was definitely good lots of crunch no soggy parts. However, a little more mayo and paté was needed. I like my bread crunchy slather and drench with flavor. Pork belly could've a couple of more slices inserted. They look like char siu with red dye edges and fatty pieces. Not asking for a hefty piece, but 4-5 more slices should be fine. The pickled carrot+daikon are fine, but cucumber was thick. With each bite, it fell off resulting in "up you go" and "down you go" effect. Main Features: Banh mi and spring roll. Products/Services: Menu on posted picture. Catering and custom order available. Punch Lines: Extremely friendly, clean, modest price, kids menu, quiet neighborhood, can't go wrong, casual and delicious, seats are minimal, unpretentious, cable car stop (in front), within steps Broadway and Polk, kids area/activities, street parking (2hr limit), local bakery deliver baked goods. Tradeoffs: Buying one order of spring rolls at $6.75 could've gotten you a sandwich with that price at some places.Final Thoughts: It's a charming place with modern cafe characteristics and conservative look. Prices are slightly more, but area is a lot safer than 2 miles down the road in the TL. With a cable car line right out front just grab a bite, hop on and enjoy the ride. Adequate place to sit on a lazy day and be yourself, perhaps catch up with a few friends.
Great neighborhood spot with delicious Banh Mi's. This is my second time trying and I got the pork belly (2nd time) and roasted pork (1st time) to share. Don't stray from pork belly, it is definitely the best! They did increase their prices from $4.75 to $5.75 between the 2 months that I had been there. Such a shame that it has to reflect nob hill prices. Not saying that $5.75 is expensive, but that is $2 more than a comparable sandwich in Little Saigon. Guess their rent is much higher I suppose.
While strolling along and day dreaming about hot guys,  I happened to stumble upon this new gem. Wowzers! What a cute little new establishment. Everything in this cafe is so cutesy, come to find out the new owner found a lot of the pieces at a junk yard, old dressers and cabinets turned into functional counter tops and a condiment station. She also built some of the furniture herself... Zaaamm! Can I get a amen, 2 snaps and a thumbs up, holla whoot whoot 1 time for the homies! Talk about skills to pay the bills. Okay before we talk FOOD! Let me say prices are dirt cheap!!!! $4.75 for a sandi & $6.75 for fresh made spring rolls!!! Daaammmm zaddy! Pork Belly & Roast Pork Banh Mi is on hit no need to say more it's a must try! Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi - soft, tender, juicy pieces of chicken go oh so well with all the goodies inside which make every bite so scrumptious. Tofu Banh Mi for all my vegetarians, OH EM GEE!!!!! Im ready to give up meat for this! But not today! Ha! How do you turn something like tofu into such goodness! All meat & pickeled veggies marinated and made with the big L, Loooooove! By their momma! Pork & Shrimp spring rolls are BOMB! So I've heard, because of this newly developed allergy to scrimps/shellfish I cannot have EM. Weeeah! Lemongrass Tofu would be my most fave! Only because I'm allergic to shrimp *sad face with a tear*  I think I've become a tofu lover now because of The Soapbox Cafe! "Nicely done" Homemade Peanut & fish sauce for dipping is on point! The perfect addition to make everything so much more better! Pre-made salads look delish!!! Beet Salad is soooo good! Candied walnuts to perfection, I usually don't do salads without meat but I did this time and it was not a fail at all! Love! Love! Love! My favorite drink there right now is the strawberry fizzy, oh my lord Jesus hallelujah amen! Need I say more? Vietnamese coffee is made perfectly! Let the ice melt a little before you sip away and then be ready to be blown away! Staff here are tremendously friendly, can't wait to return to try out everything on the menu
Had the grilled pork banh mi and a shrimp and pork spring roll.  Both delicious.  Very clean space with a friendly staff.  Highly recommend!
Come here often. Service is excellent and food is even better. Everything is here is good. Spring rolls are only Friday and Saturday. They continue to add to the menu as well. My favorite Vietnamese sandwich and coffee in SF!
Yum! The pork belly banh mi at Soapbox is the perfect lunch to kick off the weekend. Yes, the price keeps going up and up but only because it's worth it!The space is super cute but there's not that much sitting room so we usually end up calling in and picking up =)

Was it formerly a laundry? Soap and food don't mix....2. Tourists stare at you because they can due to the windows. I kind of felt like I was a gorilla at the zoo. Poor gorillas. There's a reason why I dont go to the zoo....
Adorable little Vietnamese sandwich cafe located right in the European village section of Nob Hill. Beautifully yet simply designed, love the vintage furniture blends with the the high ceilings and corner glass windows and jazz music. The sandwiches are definitely a bit more sophisticated than what you would find in the Tenderloin but no less authentic. Portions are average but lots of extra flavors via Maggi sauce and a dash of pepper really round out the profile of the combo sandwich. I'll be back to try the Vietnamese coffee when I'm up for some casual relaxation in the area.
Love! Super cute decor and just a very calm and peaceful atmosphere.There is not much seating inside but I came off peak hours and found a seat quickly.The food is fresh and delicious and there is a nice variety for a cafe.The Vietnamese Tea was amazing,the perfect amount of sweetness.
Finally tried this place for lunch today and it did NOT disappoint. After perusing the menu, we ordered the strawberry fizzie (homemade soda with fresh muddled strawberries-very refreshing with the right amount of sweetness), an order of the shrimp and pork spring rolls, the roasted pork banh mi and the lemongrass chicken banh mi. First of all, my SO and I were in agreement that the spring rolls were maybe some of the best we've ever had. Super simple but fresh ingredients and a delicious dipping sauce really makes all the difference. Both of our banh mis were delicious...great bread, tender meats and fresh veggies...what's not to love?! This cafe is super cute with friendly staff, delicious eats and it's maybe a 5-minute walk from our place which we're both pretty excited about.
Sprinklin' in a little variety on Hyde Street. I like it. 80 degree temps and a Friday afternoon, thought I'd treat myself to a refreshing lunch. Walked in and was pleasantly greeted, order was taken. Then begun the wait...Besides being on the slow side, the place kind of confused me. There are shelved books for sale, what looks like a kiddie corner - think children's games and toys plus a school-style seat, and then a random smattering of breakfast goods. Regardless, the bahn mi and spring roll options are just as you would select. Pork, chicken, tofu, shrimp. Really all you need! Opted for the roast pork sandwich and lemongrass chicken spring rolls. Not bad! Tasty, quality ingredients. Yup, I'll be back!
Time: 12:04pm/67°F partly sunnyPurpose: After a short soft opening stint they were close for unknown reasons. Going on a hunch, I swing by again. What do you know? They're open back! Ambiance: This corner location cafe is just what the neighborhood needs. Walking in you can feel good vibes and coziness before even seated. It feels homey and somewhat family oriented. Place begin with wooden L-shape counter line with all cafe essentials and supplies. Couple of round tables nestle against wall mounted box bench seater with cushion/pillows for added comfort. Wooden communal table with glass top sits six comfortably. Natural sun rays magnified through windows can burn your neckline. Depending on the strength of UV that day, it may or may not just be careful. Rest of place with wooden linoleum tiles, utensil station, single door beverage fridge, wooden bench and kid area. Decor are mostly wooden box crates with household items like books, glass ornaments and local SF artist crafts. Simple design nothing extravagant just enough to get message out.Staff: A girl about late 20s very friendly with Minnie mouse voice. Voice so soft, I can't hear her asking me what sandwich I wanted as, cable car bell echoe in doorway. So, I stood there looking at her thinking will she take my order? Then, it became apparent, I didn't hear her first time. She explain that their sandwiches are made differently than standard one. I ask how? She said meat are heated twice. Never in a rush to up sell or ask to buy. Her can do attitude prompted me be more relax instead of rsuhing my order.Cleanliness: Grade A, immaculate from counter to table. No complaints of what so ever. Health department paper posted in public view. There's not one trashbox seen. However, when you're done just leave on table and they'll bus when free. Eats/Drinks: Pork belly sandwich $4.75 and San Pellegrino $2. The bread was definitely good lots of crunch no soggy parts. However, a little more mayo and paté was needed. I like my bread crunchy slather and drench with flavor. Pork belly could've a couple of more slices inserted. They look like char siu with red dye edges and fatty pieces. Not asking for a hefty piece, but 4-5 more slices should be fine. The pickled carrot+daikon are fine, but cucumber was thick. With each bite, it fell off resulting in "up you go" and "down you go" effect. Main Features: Banh mi and spring roll. Products/Services: Menu on posted picture. Catering and custom order available. Punch Lines: Extremely friendly, clean, modest price, kids menu, quiet neighborhood, can't go wrong, casual and delicious, seats are minimal, unpretentious, cable car stop (in front), within steps Broadway and Polk, kids area/activities, street parking (2hr limit), local bakery deliver baked goods. Tradeoffs: Buying one order of spring rolls at $6.75 could've gotten you a sandwich with that price at some places.Final Thoughts: It's a charming place with modern cafe characteristics and conservative look. Prices are slightly more, but area is a lot safer than 2 miles down the road in the TL. With a cable car line right out front just grab a bite, hop on and enjoy the ride. Adequate place to sit on a lazy day and be yourself, perhaps catch up with a few friends.
Great neighborhood spot with delicious Banh Mi's. This is my second time trying and I got the pork belly (2nd time) and roasted pork (1st time) to share. Don't stray from pork belly, it is definitely the best! They did increase their prices from $4.75 to $5.75 between the 2 months that I had been there. Such a shame that it has to reflect nob hill prices. Not saying that $5.75 is expensive, but that is $2 more than a comparable sandwich in Little Saigon. Guess their rent is much higher I suppose.
While strolling along and day dreaming about hot guys,  I happened to stumble upon this new gem. Wowzers! What a cute little new establishment. Everything in this cafe is so cutesy, come to find out the new owner found a lot of the pieces at a junk yard, old dressers and cabinets turned into functional counter tops and a condiment station. She also built some of the furniture herself... Zaaamm! Can I get a amen, 2 snaps and a thumbs up, holla whoot whoot 1 time for the homies! Talk about skills to pay the bills. Okay before we talk FOOD! Let me say prices are dirt cheap!!!! $4.75 for a sandi & $6.75 for fresh made spring rolls!!! Daaammmm zaddy! Pork Belly & Roast Pork Banh Mi is on hit no need to say more it's a must try! Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi - soft, tender, juicy pieces of chicken go oh so well with all the goodies inside which make every bite so scrumptious. Tofu Banh Mi for all my vegetarians, OH EM GEE!!!!! Im ready to give up meat for this! But not today! Ha! How do you turn something like tofu into such goodness! All meat & pickeled veggies marinated and made with the big L, Loooooove! By their momma! Pork & Shrimp spring rolls are BOMB! So I've heard, because of this newly developed allergy to scrimps/shellfish I cannot have EM. Weeeah! Lemongrass Tofu would be my most fave! Only because I'm allergic to shrimp *sad face with a tear*  I think I've become a tofu lover now because of The Soapbox Cafe! "Nicely done" Homemade Peanut & fish sauce for dipping is on point! The perfect addition to make everything so much more better! Pre-made salads look delish!!! Beet Salad is soooo good! Candied walnuts to perfection, I usually don't do salads without meat but I did this time and it was not a fail at all! Love! Love! Love! My favorite drink there right now is the strawberry fizzy, oh my lord Jesus hallelujah amen! Need I say more? Vietnamese coffee is made perfectly! Let the ice melt a little before you sip away and then be ready to be blown away! Staff here are tremendously friendly, can't wait to return to try out everything on the menu
Had the grilled pork banh mi and a shrimp and pork spring roll.  Both delicious.  Very clean space with a friendly staff.  Highly recommend!
Come here often. Service is excellent and food is even better. Everything is here is good. Spring rolls are only Friday and Saturday. They continue to add to the menu as well. My favorite Vietnamese sandwich and coffee in SF!
Yum! The pork belly banh mi at Soapbox is the perfect lunch to kick off the weekend. Yes, the price keeps going up and up but only because it's worth it!The space is super cute but there's not that much sitting room so we usually end up calling in and picking up =)
My little daughter and I came in on a Saturday afternoon and had a blast! They have a small area filled with toys and crayons...I thought we were going to be in and out with take out but we ended up staying and loved it. Banh mi was delicious. I had the pork belly and will be back for more. The pickled carrots are perfect, and all ingredients are fresh. Daughter asked for more bread and when the employees saw that, they gave us a bag of all in the inner pieces of bread that they pull out!!  So thoughtful. My 1 year old ate more than I did lol. Thanks for the great experience!
This little cafe is SUPER chic and cute! It's on the corner of Vallejo and Hyde Streets in the Russian Hill neighborhood of SF. The windows let in a TON of natural light into the cafe, the door was open letting fresh air flow through, and the cable cars passes thru the frontside of the cafe -- making this such a nice spot for people watching.The staff is AMAZING! The mother-daughter team did a wonderful job in hiring really polite, attentive staff. They are friendly and can recommend the best items to order on the menu.My husband order the combo bahn mi -- #6 from the sandwiches list. The bread is baked fresh daily and toasted to perfection. You get a really nice, light crunch. The headcheese adds a nice crunch, the pork belly adds a juicy goodness, and the veggies makes the sandwich light and fresh.I ordered the pork and shrimp spring roll. These are made regularly throughout the day to ensure freshness. The sauce is really tasty. Add the peanuts and sriracha to the sauce if you want it to be extra yummy.We also had two Vietnamese coffee on ice. The made-to-order coffees are strong and rich. Great as an afternoon pick-me-up.Totally check out this place if you're up for something light, tasty, and delicious!
Cute banh mi place! Family run and local. Tbh, I've had better bahn mi's but these taste fresher/healthier, so maybe that's part of the reason. I'm adding a star because I want to support a local business.Pro tip: Fancy pork - not so fancy. Maybe more akin to fancy-feast (the cat food??)
This quiet Russian Hill street corner has been through so many different businesses. Now the new Vietnamese bakery and café has settled in to the area with what not many neighboring businesses in the area offer: Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi). On my debut, for dinner I ordered the Five-spiced chicken banh mi. For $4.75, which is reasonably priced, I get the grilled chicken meat with the standard shredded carrots, daikon, cucumbers, onions and cilantro in a customary warm roll. The chicken meat was cooked and spiced perfectly. But what is unique about the café's sandwich is the condiments are seasoned and grilled, which adds flavors and explosion to my taste buds. For now, new café only offer a limited menu. But once the café is situated, I hope they will offer more food items to excite the quiet Russian Hill neighborhood.
Want a damn good authentic Vietnamese sandwich? Look no further than this place. The tofu sandwich is by far my fave but the others are equally as tasty! Vermicelli bowls....bomb dot com! Spring rolls...dope! Vietnamese coffee...on point! Fizzy drinks...a must try!Really cute decor and very well kept. Clean all around. The owner is also super friendly and sweet. One of my fave new spots :)
Bahn mi was okay.  They give you lots of pickled carrots but hardly any meat.  90% pickled carrots and other veggies, 10% meat.
Finally, a cozy cafe in Russian Hill! This place really makes you feel warm and at home. Super friendly family that owns and runs it and the Banh Mi sandwiches are on point! The patê spread makes all the difference and the ingredients are all super fresh, to go along with the extremely clean and tidy feel of the place in general. I'll be back for the Vietnamese iced coffee and the company!
Strong coffee, delicious sandwich, spot clean store, and friendly staffs all in one place! Too bad they close early during weekdays.
How can you not love a quaint cafe that serves authentic Vietnamese sandwiches? I've tried a handful of Banh Mi spots in the city, and this one is definitely up there. Opt for the combo if you're adventurous.Bonus points: there's a tiny park across the street to the right. Perfect spot to sit down with your coffee and sandwich.
Nice venue.  It's a small, well put together space right on the cable car line. There are big windows, so it feels light and airy inside even though it's tiny.We had a lemon grass chicken banh mi, cold rolls ( pork and shrimp), hot vietnamese coffee, and a florentine/tuile-like cookie dipped in chocolate.I liked the banh mi fine. It had all of the necessary ingredients and the bread was super crunchy and perfect. Kid wanted it to have mayo too ( it didnt) and she still likes Saigon better. I thought it was pretty good, but could have used more chicken. I would get it again, though. It was tasty.I thought the cold rolls were fine, but not quite as flavorful as I wanted them to be. The coffee and cookie were perfection!!! Overall, a nice spot with good service and definitely worth a stop.Two minor quibbles:1. Why is it named 'soap box'? Nobody was expounding on anything there.

Had the grilled pork banh mi and a shrimp and pork spring roll.  Both delicious.  Very clean space with a friendly staff.  Highly recommend!
Come here often. Service is excellent and food is even better. Everything is here is good. Spring rolls are only Friday and Saturday. They continue to add to the menu as well. My favorite Vietnamese sandwich and coffee in SF!
