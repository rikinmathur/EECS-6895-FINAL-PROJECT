The temporary setup is just as wonderful as the permanent location was, at least for our purposes (toddler who is mostly interested in the animal room).  The small playground in the atrium, while modest in itself, is a breathtaking setting.  How often do you hear "breathtaking" and "playground" in the same sentence?If you're unfamiliar with Randall, check out the reviews for their permanent location.  Most of the exhibits are the same, and you can expect to have an hour or two of fun with the under 5 set here.
