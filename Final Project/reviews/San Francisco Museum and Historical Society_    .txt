a warning re: the christmas tea - do not expect to get any food!  2 of us attended in 2012 and did not arrive early (we did arrive at the scheduled time), as it seems those in the know did - we were put in the overflow room and there was not enough food to serve us because the folks in the first room had asked for so many seconds!  kinda disappointing to expect scones with jam and clotted cream, and then get no scones (although a woman at our table who had grabbed one of the few scones available said they weren't that great, we would have liked to check that out for ourselves) - $75 a head is a bit much for a few tiny sandwiches...the rest of the experience was fun - posing with father christmas at the entrance, checking out the exhibit cases, and then the tour of the vaultbut never again for us - too much money for a big disappointment
