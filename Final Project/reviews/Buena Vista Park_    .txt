An Off the Beaten Path Park with Beautiful Natural Scenery, Incredible Panoramic Views and Hiking Trails! My mother and I visited Buena Vista Park during the afternoon of August 1st. We had been exploring the Haight-Ashbury neighbourhood and ended up wandering further down Haight Street, when we discovered Buena Vista Park. The park is basically a large hill with walking trails winding through the densely wooded landscape to the top of the hill. We entered the park and began hiking to the top. The hill was steep and I had to take frequent breaks as I climbed. It was a really exhausting and tough hike, so be prepared for a great work-out! The scenery along the pathways through the forest were beautiful. The trees were so huge! We finally made it to the top of the hill, where there was an open grassy area and a clearing in the trees, with a park bench overlooking the entire city. I hadn't realized how high we had climbed until we made it to the top and saw the amazing panoramic views of the surrounding city! They were incredible and we took some time to relax, admire the views while taking lots of photos, and absorb the fantastic natural beauty around us. The atmosphere was so tranquil and calm. It felt like we were in the middle of a secluded forest and not in the middle of the city. What (pleasantly) surprised me, was the fact that we only saw two other people in the entire park during our visit and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. Buena Vista Park is definitely an off the beaten path, hidden gem in San Francisco. With stunning views and beautiful natural scenery like what this park offers, this is a must-visit for nature lovers, fitness gurus, and those looking for an off the tourist track experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this park and it was well worth a visit!Shhh... Don't tell anyone how great it is. I want this place to remain a secretive hidden gem!
A beautiful park that makes you forget you are in the city. There's some hiking trails and steps that can take you to the top of the park and get a nice panorama view of the city. A bit of a workout going up but the hike is quite short and maybe takes only 15 minutes. Truthfully, the harder part is going back down the steps since the steps are so wide. At the top, it is a very tranquil spot and a wonderful place to just sit and enjoy the wonders of Mother Nature. There's not many tourists here and a lot of locals bring their dogs here to run around the paths. There is a small children's playground in the park.
Such a beautiful and picturesque park! One Sunday morning, I wanted to go on a walk from Castro to Haight and came back via Buena Vista Park. The greenery makes you forget about being in such a huge city. There's plenty of paths to take with minimal tourists here. I would definitely take out-of-town visitors here to this San Francisco gem - now one of my favorite parks in the city!
There was a bunch of grass on the stairs. Got to the top and there were dumb old trees blocking the view. I can't believe I wasted my time here. Go to a different park.
This is actually my favorite park so far. Not that I've been to many but the city views and the feel of the neighborhood is so gorgeous and welcoming. Wild flowers and huge aged trees.
There are tons of steps at the park.  Up and up you  go finally,  Look at the tree tops.  It used to have the best view anywhere,  the trees cover most of it.
You'd think given the location that this would be a great park with awesome views. Instead you get homeless people hanging around the entrance on Haight and blocking the way in and potheads up at the top. And there are hardly any views since it's just trees trees and more trees shrubs blocking the way. You'll definitely get a workout walking up though because it's one of the longest steepest paths from the street to the top.Given that I have Dolores Park, Corona Heights, Tank Hill, Kite Hill and Billy Goat Hill - not to mention Twin Peaks all within the same radius of my apt as Buena Vista Park it pretty much rates at the bottom of the list.
My favorite place to jog. I enjoy getting lost in the foliage. The untamed trails and tall trees  - I love. Lots if uphill trails.
Homeless encampment. Hardly a view because of the shrubs. But good park to jog. The stairs will will make you sweat.
As a Bay Area native, I am embarrassed to admit that I had never walked into Buena Vista Park before last weekend. Like most people who don't live in the immediate vicinity, my default choices for bucolic frolicking have been Golden Gate Park, the Presidio or Dolores Park where spaces are more wide open. But if you like a little more elevation (575 feet high) in a condensed forest, then Buena Vista does the trick, all 37 acres of it. Jamie W. and I just happened upon it because we were at the Castro MUNI station, and out of sheer randomness, I suggested we go north on Castro versus our usual route of going into the Castro. Jamie was a good sport, and we trudged our significant arses up 15th Street and then Park Hill Avenue where we were greeted by a large rat only to find a long flight of steps beckoning us.From there, it was just a quick stroll to the summit where there were already a herd of camera-wielding European tourists and a couple of dog walkers, all of them taking in what we could see of the view through the trees. The best view from here is toward the Golden Gate Bridge, but you have to position yourself just right for your obligatory photo op. We then descended down toward the west where there is a genuinely nice view of St. Ignatius Church and the NOPA neighborhood. You eventually find yourself on Haight where the grassy area is festooned with what looks like the remnants of Woodstock or at least Burning Man with a lot of hippie types in all sorts of horizontal positions. The smell of weed was thick, and if it were better quality, we would have stayed. But no, it was time to leave the park.
This park is like a rainforest in the middle of the city without the humidity, monkeys or giant spiders (I've trekked through the Amazon--I know of what I speak). The foliage is really dense in certain parts and even when you're walking along clearly paved trails, you feel a hush in the air that's partly due to all the surrounding vegetation. Bonus: blackberry bushes. Lots and lots of blackberry bushes.When you get to the top, the view is stunning with the added bonus of being able to see even higher peaks like Corona Heights Park not too far away.
This sprawling park is a plot of Narnia plopped in the middle of the bustling city. Though a favorite among dog-owners and groups on the weekends, Buena Vista Park still manages to give you that magical hush that comes from being a hundred miles from civilization. When you first enter the park through one of the entrances on Haight Street, you can trek up winding paved paths that zig zag up the face of the hill. It's a manageable walk, but the going does get steep in some sections (so bring the sneakers and leave the little kids). For the more adventurous (and less patient), there are also a whole network of off-the-beaten-path stairs and trails that cut through the dense groves of the pines and oaks that grow here. On your way up the slopes, you can catch glimpses of absolutely breathtaking vistas (thus the name!) of the city skyline through the foliage. Though there are grassy slopes towards the bottom of the park near Haight for people who want to picnic and socialize, the park itself is a mini wild patch of land and more suited to being a walker's paradise-- the soothing calm it offers visitors is perfect for soul-searching and thought-sorting.
Not sure why BV Park gets as high ratings as it does.  The views from the top are negligible.  The views from a bit below the summit on the north (Haight St side) are better but still not as good as other locales.  Maybe it's the large grassy area adjacent to Haight St?  I dunno but if this park hadn't been on my hiking route down to Haight St I would have been disappointed.  I guess I'm glad I've been there and delete from my list of places to visit.  Go elsewhere for views of SF.
San Francisco is a place of heart.   It is a place where things come together and break apart and come back together again.  It is a place to build memories, to take photos, to experience life to the fullest and to take that knowledge and share it with the world.  It isn't surprising to me that the technology industry is here and booming because this is where ideas emerge and radiate.  Where am I going with this rambling review?  Well, I've had ecstatic walks here, hopeful walks and just as sad goodbye walks.  If the hills at Buena Vista Park could talk, they would tell of mixed emotions of my short timeline in SF, as well as, of those of others. I love my city by the Bay.
Great place to take your dog! I live in the neighborhood and bring my dog here often. He loves wondering around and meeting all the other puppies. It is great exercise to explore the park and the views from the top are beautiful. I would say to avoid the park after dark, but otherwise I come here 1-3 times a day.
Hanging in The Haight With Dogs would be a great name for a song. Or a sitcom. Or a doggy vegan cookbook. My pal Jon A took his dog Noam Chomsky and I* to Buena Vista to check out the views and get Choms some much needed exercise.Buena Vista is 37 acres and was in Vertigo. Thanks Wikipedia. She is a magical hilly forest that stands tall above SF in Haight Ashbury.  The views are a tourist's dream, so if you're not from the Bay Area you should definitely check this park out. Buena Vista itself has many playgrounds, types of massive trees and butt-loads of homeless partays at night. Sidebar: If I was a homeless person who hung out a lot in BV I'd definitely call my posse the Buena Vista Social Club. PEPPER'S PISSED: About one particular dog owner whose dog body checked NC hurting his precious paw. If you're a dick then your dog will be a dick so do everyone a favor and use a leash and try not to procreate. *Fun Fact: We are all gingers. Even cutie pie N Chomsky. What a peach.
Though Buena Vista Park isn't necessarily the kind of park that I'd recommend wandering around at night or early in the morning in by yourself, it still remains one of the most under-rated parks in the San Francisco area. It boasts some of the most stunning glimpses of the city and beyond - up in it's hilly foliage, and if you're looking for an energizing walk and solitary escape to nature  - it's full of great inclines and hidden treasures.And random fact(ish): I listened to Rich Girl on repeat here for at least 40 times - a little while back.Trust.
I hiked up here in the mild rain one afternoon. Much do prefer this park over say.. Bernal Heights'. Here, there's also the Saturn Steps and the Vulcan Stairway to ooh and aaah over---not to mention the great houses to enjoy. Randall Museum is just a hop/skip away, and all the plethora of cool eats just down the hill.Driving up Levant Street was a trip! Brilliantly located park in the center of it all... lovely  trail... more 'character' to this park perched atop a hill.
I grew up in the bay area, and never knew this place existed! Me and the BF took a short trip to the bay, and I took him to Golden Gate Park. I thought we could take the bus to Haight-Ashbury, and walk from there to the park. On our way, we spotted this fancy grand staircase that looked like it led to someplace magical. We were curious, so we made our way up the stairs. It seems there's a couple pathways once you get up there. They all went upwards. So we continued to climb up. On and on we went, and we could begin to make out a view of the bay. It was slightly foggy that day, so we could only see glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge. We continued to climb all the way to the top, and it was a pretty awesome view from up there. I wish there weren't so many trees so that you could overlook the whole city. There's a little bench up there, and it's pretty romantic. I wish we had a dog to bring with us. There's a little dog run somewhere in this park where you can let them run around and play.
A great place to take a stroll and relax.Every single one of my visits has included the following:*A long hike up a hill*Sweat on the brow*Seeing a homeless person urinate*The downing of a 40I love this park. Find a bench and down some of your favorite malt beverage.

Though Buena Vista Park isn't necessarily the kind of park that I'd recommend wandering around at night or early in the morning in by yourself, it still remains one of the most under-rated parks in the San Francisco area. It boasts some of the most stunning glimpses of the city and beyond - up in it's hilly foliage, and if you're looking for an energizing walk and solitary escape to nature  - it's full of great inclines and hidden treasures.And random fact(ish): I listened to Rich Girl on repeat here for at least 40 times - a little while back.Trust.
I hiked up here in the mild rain one afternoon. Much do prefer this park over say.. Bernal Heights'. Here, there's also the Saturn Steps and the Vulcan Stairway to ooh and aaah over---not to mention the great houses to enjoy. Randall Museum is just a hop/skip away, and all the plethora of cool eats just down the hill.Driving up Levant Street was a trip! Brilliantly located park in the center of it all... lovely  trail... more 'character' to this park perched atop a hill.
I grew up in the bay area, and never knew this place existed! Me and the BF took a short trip to the bay, and I took him to Golden Gate Park. I thought we could take the bus to Haight-Ashbury, and walk from there to the park. On our way, we spotted this fancy grand staircase that looked like it led to someplace magical. We were curious, so we made our way up the stairs. It seems there's a couple pathways once you get up there. They all went upwards. So we continued to climb up. On and on we went, and we could begin to make out a view of the bay. It was slightly foggy that day, so we could only see glimpses of the Golden Gate Bridge. We continued to climb all the way to the top, and it was a pretty awesome view from up there. I wish there weren't so many trees so that you could overlook the whole city. There's a little bench up there, and it's pretty romantic. I wish we had a dog to bring with us. There's a little dog run somewhere in this park where you can let them run around and play.
A great place to take a stroll and relax.Every single one of my visits has included the following:*A long hike up a hill*Sweat on the brow*Seeing a homeless person urinate*The downing of a 40I love this park. Find a bench and down some of your favorite malt beverage.
An Off the Beaten Path Park with Beautiful Natural Scenery, Incredible Panoramic Views and Hiking Trails! My mother and I visited Buena Vista Park during the afternoon of August 1st. We had been exploring the Haight-Ashbury neighbourhood and ended up wandering further down Haight Street, when we discovered Buena Vista Park. The park is basically a large hill with walking trails winding through the densely wooded landscape to the top of the hill. We entered the park and began hiking to the top. The hill was steep and I had to take frequent breaks as I climbed. It was a really exhausting and tough hike, so be prepared for a great work-out! The scenery along the pathways through the forest were beautiful. The trees were so huge! We finally made it to the top of the hill, where there was an open grassy area and a clearing in the trees, with a park bench overlooking the entire city. I hadn't realized how high we had climbed until we made it to the top and saw the amazing panoramic views of the surrounding city! They were incredible and we took some time to relax, admire the views while taking lots of photos, and absorb the fantastic natural beauty around us. The atmosphere was so tranquil and calm. It felt like we were in the middle of a secluded forest and not in the middle of the city. What (pleasantly) surprised me, was the fact that we only saw two other people in the entire park during our visit and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. Buena Vista Park is definitely an off the beaten path, hidden gem in San Francisco. With stunning views and beautiful natural scenery like what this park offers, this is a must-visit for nature lovers, fitness gurus, and those looking for an off the tourist track experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this park and it was well worth a visit!Shhh... Don't tell anyone how great it is. I want this place to remain a secretive hidden gem!
A beautiful park that makes you forget you are in the city. There's some hiking trails and steps that can take you to the top of the park and get a nice panorama view of the city. A bit of a workout going up but the hike is quite short and maybe takes only 15 minutes. Truthfully, the harder part is going back down the steps since the steps are so wide. At the top, it is a very tranquil spot and a wonderful place to just sit and enjoy the wonders of Mother Nature. There's not many tourists here and a lot of locals bring their dogs here to run around the paths. There is a small children's playground in the park.
Such a beautiful and picturesque park! One Sunday morning, I wanted to go on a walk from Castro to Haight and came back via Buena Vista Park. The greenery makes you forget about being in such a huge city. There's plenty of paths to take with minimal tourists here. I would definitely take out-of-town visitors here to this San Francisco gem - now one of my favorite parks in the city!
There was a bunch of grass on the stairs. Got to the top and there were dumb old trees blocking the view. I can't believe I wasted my time here. Go to a different park.
This is actually my favorite park so far. Not that I've been to many but the city views and the feel of the neighborhood is so gorgeous and welcoming. Wild flowers and huge aged trees.
There are tons of steps at the park.  Up and up you  go finally,  Look at the tree tops.  It used to have the best view anywhere,  the trees cover most of it.
You'd think given the location that this would be a great park with awesome views. Instead you get homeless people hanging around the entrance on Haight and blocking the way in and potheads up at the top. And there are hardly any views since it's just trees trees and more trees shrubs blocking the way. You'll definitely get a workout walking up though because it's one of the longest steepest paths from the street to the top.Given that I have Dolores Park, Corona Heights, Tank Hill, Kite Hill and Billy Goat Hill - not to mention Twin Peaks all within the same radius of my apt as Buena Vista Park it pretty much rates at the bottom of the list.
My favorite place to jog. I enjoy getting lost in the foliage. The untamed trails and tall trees  - I love. Lots if uphill trails.
Homeless encampment. Hardly a view because of the shrubs. But good park to jog. The stairs will will make you sweat.
As a Bay Area native, I am embarrassed to admit that I had never walked into Buena Vista Park before last weekend. Like most people who don't live in the immediate vicinity, my default choices for bucolic frolicking have been Golden Gate Park, the Presidio or Dolores Park where spaces are more wide open. But if you like a little more elevation (575 feet high) in a condensed forest, then Buena Vista does the trick, all 37 acres of it. Jamie W. and I just happened upon it because we were at the Castro MUNI station, and out of sheer randomness, I suggested we go north on Castro versus our usual route of going into the Castro. Jamie was a good sport, and we trudged our significant arses up 15th Street and then Park Hill Avenue where we were greeted by a large rat only to find a long flight of steps beckoning us.From there, it was just a quick stroll to the summit where there were already a herd of camera-wielding European tourists and a couple of dog walkers, all of them taking in what we could see of the view through the trees. The best view from here is toward the Golden Gate Bridge, but you have to position yourself just right for your obligatory photo op. We then descended down toward the west where there is a genuinely nice view of St. Ignatius Church and the NOPA neighborhood. You eventually find yourself on Haight where the grassy area is festooned with what looks like the remnants of Woodstock or at least Burning Man with a lot of hippie types in all sorts of horizontal positions. The smell of weed was thick, and if it were better quality, we would have stayed. But no, it was time to leave the park.
This park is like a rainforest in the middle of the city without the humidity, monkeys or giant spiders (I've trekked through the Amazon--I know of what I speak). The foliage is really dense in certain parts and even when you're walking along clearly paved trails, you feel a hush in the air that's partly due to all the surrounding vegetation. Bonus: blackberry bushes. Lots and lots of blackberry bushes.When you get to the top, the view is stunning with the added bonus of being able to see even higher peaks like Corona Heights Park not too far away.
This sprawling park is a plot of Narnia plopped in the middle of the bustling city. Though a favorite among dog-owners and groups on the weekends, Buena Vista Park still manages to give you that magical hush that comes from being a hundred miles from civilization. When you first enter the park through one of the entrances on Haight Street, you can trek up winding paved paths that zig zag up the face of the hill. It's a manageable walk, but the going does get steep in some sections (so bring the sneakers and leave the little kids). For the more adventurous (and less patient), there are also a whole network of off-the-beaten-path stairs and trails that cut through the dense groves of the pines and oaks that grow here. On your way up the slopes, you can catch glimpses of absolutely breathtaking vistas (thus the name!) of the city skyline through the foliage. Though there are grassy slopes towards the bottom of the park near Haight for people who want to picnic and socialize, the park itself is a mini wild patch of land and more suited to being a walker's paradise-- the soothing calm it offers visitors is perfect for soul-searching and thought-sorting.
Not sure why BV Park gets as high ratings as it does.  The views from the top are negligible.  The views from a bit below the summit on the north (Haight St side) are better but still not as good as other locales.  Maybe it's the large grassy area adjacent to Haight St?  I dunno but if this park hadn't been on my hiking route down to Haight St I would have been disappointed.  I guess I'm glad I've been there and delete from my list of places to visit.  Go elsewhere for views of SF.
San Francisco is a place of heart.   It is a place where things come together and break apart and come back together again.  It is a place to build memories, to take photos, to experience life to the fullest and to take that knowledge and share it with the world.  It isn't surprising to me that the technology industry is here and booming because this is where ideas emerge and radiate.  Where am I going with this rambling review?  Well, I've had ecstatic walks here, hopeful walks and just as sad goodbye walks.  If the hills at Buena Vista Park could talk, they would tell of mixed emotions of my short timeline in SF, as well as, of those of others. I love my city by the Bay.
Great place to take your dog! I live in the neighborhood and bring my dog here often. He loves wondering around and meeting all the other puppies. It is great exercise to explore the park and the views from the top are beautiful. I would say to avoid the park after dark, but otherwise I come here 1-3 times a day.
Hanging in The Haight With Dogs would be a great name for a song. Or a sitcom. Or a doggy vegan cookbook. My pal Jon A took his dog Noam Chomsky and I* to Buena Vista to check out the views and get Choms some much needed exercise.Buena Vista is 37 acres and was in Vertigo. Thanks Wikipedia. She is a magical hilly forest that stands tall above SF in Haight Ashbury.  The views are a tourist's dream, so if you're not from the Bay Area you should definitely check this park out.
