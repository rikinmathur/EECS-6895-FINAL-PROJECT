Well, this review is mainly for their sides or how they call it sandwich sidekicks!!Stuffed Jalapenos, Onion Rings, Seasoned Curly Fries - All I can say is YUM YUM YUM!!! And, for sure I've become a huge fan of all three, Yayyyy!!! They taste so awesomely delicious, fried stuff but not dripping oily at all (I'm super impressed), very reasonably priced and comes in with different serving sizes too.Stuffed Jalapenos ($2.19 & $4.19) - 3 piece and 7 piece; Cheese StuffingOnion Rings ($2.29) - Just one portion size of about 97g; CrispySeasoned Curly Fries ($1.99, $2.29 & $2.49) - Small, Medium & Large; very tasty and cooked justly at the right heating temperatureThis facility was maintained clean, friendly staff at the bill counters with ample good high chair-round table seatings. I wouldn't say that the order was served real quick, but the wait time was neither too long. Great to learn that this spot is opened 24hours and is located at the heart of Downtown SF, big bonus to all night owls!!Parking Tip, Street parking only!
Jack in the Box needs to improve a lot of their items.Too many JiTB items are dry and flavorless, and yet pricey at the same time. A typical burger here costs $4-6, which would be fine if their food tastes better.For me, their biggest problem is their french fry quality. It's bland and dry, especially compared to BK and McDs, both of those places take pride in their fries' quality. When i go to McDs, the french fries are a big highlight for me.They mess up the curly fries too. They are one of the few fast food places that offer curly fries and yet they mess it up. It's a simple thing to do, start selling better fries!
Whoever was working on register tonight (first hours of 31st of january) is a thieve. I asked for medium size 12th meal (chicken) and she asked for 11$. (I was like this should cost less than that but did not insist). After I started driving my car, i realized that she also sold(!) me chicken tinders. Fuck this place and that employee seriously.
Stopped in here later at night since we were walking by and have never tasted anything from this chain.  There was a long line but we waited since we had to check out the menu.  They offer a "value" menu so we ordered the jr. bacon cheeseburger, big cheeseburger and the jr. Jack.  These sizes were just right for a snack at a good price.  The burgers tasted good and I would try other items from this chain.The only thing about this location was the front doors were wide open and many less fortunate people were approaching customers for money or food.
I dont see why people complain its a damn Jack in the Box not some fancy restaurant. Anyways it tastes the same as  any jack you go to. Open 24hrs which is a plus. The times I've went staff is always great to me & i get my food quick! But I would also recommend to get your food to go, there are always homeless people inside asking for money or your food, but thats just a normal thing in SF!
Other than a few drunks or bums in and out of this place, I still love their food! Typical fast-food but still yummy! Cheap, fattening and unhealthy but ain't gonna lie.. I love grease :) Their crispy curly fries are seasoned well. Egg-rolls are still crispy and yummm with the sauce. Chicken strips tender in the inside and crispy on the outside. I must say their buttermilk sauce which is like ranch sauce is still thick and very delish for dipping those finger foods! Actually all their sauces are better than most fast-food joints. I don't know why but I like their tacos. Maybe cause I grew up eating it and probably got used to it or something. I'll always come back here! Oh and one last thing.. I praise those workers for trying to have more patience especially when Ruby Skye is active lol.
It's your standard Jack In the Box that's open 24hr and located super close to Ruby Skye, so a reasonable post-EDM food stop before heading home. You might get some weird people here and there, and wait-times for food can be variable, but it's nothing out-of-the-ordinary for your venue and location (or hour of day).
I get harmlessly harassed by a hobo everytime when I'm waiting for my food. The service is a bit slower but then again I'm used to pulling up to a drive-thru. This is the absolute last resort when I'm not feeling food adventurous or I just want to have a fat night with a munchie box and a movie.
So I was staying at the King George hotel on mason and decided to walk to the corner and get a large drink from this jack in the box today. Unfortunately, like many large cities homeless people are all over these fast food restaurants. Today when I got here a homeless man (nice guy) wanted to get his sandwich with a coupon when he was not given service because of his condition I offered to buy him the sand which and also get him a large drink a total of 3 large drinks and a sandwich. When they started calling numbers for orders that were fulfilled all but mine was called. About 10 numbers after mine I asked the gentleman distributing these orders (Jo) what happened with my order one that I myself thought was very simple compared to others after me.( I don't work in the fast food industry but assume pouring a drink is pretty simple.) He responded "oh let me get it for you". What makes me even more upset is the fact that if I didn't ask I would have waited 20 more mins for some drinks. All because I bought a homeless man they don't like food. SF isn't what I expected , coming from a diverse background like this city I would assume they had more respect . Even these trashy places seem to not care about people.
Stuffed jalapeños and Curly fries is what I would prefer the best always. They taste absolutely delicious!!!!!!!
Ate here while waiting for an appointment in downtown San Francisco.  Fast friendly service.  Clean dining room.  Was funny to see businessmen having meetings with their Chinese counterparts in the dining room of a Jack in the Box.  Must be fairly common, because there were a lot of them in there.  Maybe they can't get enough of the awesome curly fries.
I see you judging me. Yeah, I eat at Jack in the Box once in a while. Yeah, I'm actually rating them on Yelp, and yeah, I just gave them 4 stars. Why? Their customer service. Seriously. This location deals with SO MUCH shit. Crazy people, drug addicts, drunk bros and drunken party girls spilling out of Ruby Skye and other nearby clubs and bars, acting like a-holes... and you know what? The staff handles it. I have been to this Jack in the Box more times than I wish to share with you. Sometimes drunk, sometimes hungover, sometimes sober. And I watch them deal with the shit. And they are nice, they have always gotten my order right, and it looks like they bust their ass as a team. I seriously want to write a letter to whoever owns this particular location, and tell them that they are damn lucky to have that staff. Most fast food joints, no matter where you go, are full of employees that could give 2 shits about how many tacos you ordered, or that you would like extra ranch on the side. And the staff here gives it their 100%. I hope the higher ups recognize it. If you ever go to this location, and you aren't too drunk to notice, watch the staff. They kill it!One time I was hungover and stopped at Jack in the Box on my way to work. I ordered 26 tacos and took them to my older co-workers. They looked around at each other, seeing if they would be judged by one another for eating these tasty greasy morsels at 8 AM, and then they dug into the bag like a bunch of vultures around a dead zebra. I'm pretty sure I made everyone's day.
I like Jack in the Box a lot! This location is always open so I can get food anytime!! I am addicted to their Spicy Chicken Burger. It's pretty filling with cheese or more crisp and refreshing with extra lettuce. They have Tacos 2 for 99cents. Don't expext anything exciting. They make for a nice cheap snack. The monster Tacos is bigger and around $1.5 ish but its too large to bite efficiently and so it's not as fun to eat.The Chicken Sandwich is also cheap its like a chicken nugget patty with a lettuce leaf. Good for when you don't want to chew real chicken you know. The Chicken Nuggets are alright. More expensive than McDonalds and the sauce selections are nowhere as food but it'll do. The Crispy Chicken Strips aren't very crispy and a bit dry, the texture is unexciting. I LOVE their Curly Fries. So fun!! Very flavorful. Can be a bit salty at times. Their normal Fries is kinda whatever. The Bacon Cheddar Potato wedges is too carby fatty for my taste. They used to have chorizo cheese fried which I was addicted to. The Mini Churros is fun to eat too. They bite-sizes and crispy with this curstardy filling. Don't expect too much, they're not Michelin quality - they're good for what they are. I think the ice cream shakes are a bit too thich. It's difficult to drink them theough the straw and that really hurt my cheeks. All the Cheeseburger / Hamburger varieties are pretty allright. Theyre soft and easy to chew and swallow. Good enough for me. They don't have a lasting impression or anything thought. The Munchie Meals are too crazy. They are overloaded with cheese it's impossible for me to finish but if you've been starbing for days or want a challenge then just try them out. Available after 9pm only, I think. I like Hash Browns. They have acceptable has browns. I really like their Breakfast Platter, especially the mini pancakes. So soft and cute and spongy and sweet. Breakfast is available allllllllll day. The Chicken Club salad is kinda boring. Normal. Fresh enough. I like the Southwest Chicken Salad better. They have corn!! Haha. I like the Crispy Chicken that comes with the salad a lot better than the chicken strips. These will actually be crispy.
I have lived up the hill from this place for three decades.I seldom go in unless I'm starved; if you like burgers their's are OK if you are not a foodie.  My problems with them have always been this location is a difficult place to have a meal without hassles.Today I ordered a combo meal and asked for it to be supersized as I did not eat breakfast.  It appeared the gal at the counter did not understand so i asked her to read back the order and she kept getting it regular sized three times.She just did not get it I wanted it supersized.  I almost pulled my $10 off of the counter to leave when a supervisor stepped in and showed the gal how to enter it in the computer.After all of these hassles I just wanted to eat and leave.  When my order was coming up the supervisor decided to go in the back leaving one kid on the counter.  So my order and several others sat in the heater ignored by the remaing counter guy.While we were waiting a street tough comes in and panhandle all people waiting for their food or to order.  What you do on the street is your business but any business which allows street people to hassle diners, people waiting for their food or people waiting to order is clueless.Overall I've had enough of this place and probably will not go back in for another couple of years due to the hassles - it is easier to go to McDonalds.Yes, I'm not a foodie!
This place is a freak show. Great entertainment value! Between the random homeless guys coughing their tuberculous all over, the head cases talking to themselves, and the free music from next door it's a win win!
Getting to San Francisco around 2am, we were left with little option for late night eats. Luckily Jack in the Box was big, bright, and stood out in the darkness.Given the drunken crowd on a Friday night, I was glad there was a security guard to let us in. This was a bit odd, but we were hungry, so to hell with it. The workers at the counter should be awarded a medal; they were fast, clear, and didn't get daunted by the plethora of people slurring menu items.Late night menu, what a god send. For $6: Two tacos, curly fries, a drink, and an epic grilled cheese/cheeseburger. Food coma be damned, that's value!If you can deal with a large drunken mess of people, not a bad option for cheap late night eating.
My experience with most Jack in the box locations have been good minus this location. I asked for a munchie meal and the Russian lady asked me what I wanted for my drink. I asked her to pour water into the cup with no ice. She gives me my receipt and I see that bottled water was added to the receipt. I told her I did not want bottled water, only water poured into the cup. Then she stands there arguing with me why she had put bottled water in my receipt instead of giving me the water in the cup for the next ten minutes. After that she takes out the freebie cup and puts water into that. Omg. How hard is it to use the water from the machine and pour water into the standard sized cup that comes with the meal? She gets frustrated and clearly did not want to pour water into the small sized cup and went out of her way to give me this attitude. I'd give this place zero stars if there is that option, just because of the poor training they have given to the early morning cashier. I mean how can you possibly not understand, please pour water into the cup. Don't give me what I didn't ask for.
It's one of those days; you're sick and just need to get some food in your belly so the medicine will sit better.  Hubby and I walked to the ol' Jack in hopes of getting a breakfast sandwich to satisfy our tired bodies.  We got to our destination and there was about half a dozen folks waiting for their order.  They were supposed to have a 2 for $4 deal on their croissant breakfast sandwiches; apparently this location did not participate in this deal.  Oh well, we were still hungry and a few extra dollars wouldn't kill us.I ordered two Supreme Breakfast Croissants with hashbrowns.  I waited... and waited.. and waited.  But that's okay, we figured, it will be worth the wait!We got home (less than 10 minutes later), broke open the bag and wrapper and took a bite.  The croissant was soggy and the ham was SOOOO salty. I literally thought I would have a coronary just after one bite!Good thing I had my coffee to wash it down, but no one said salty coffee was a good thing.  Hubby and I barely could finish it, but we looked at the bright side; at least the sandwich made us drink more water and we'll stay hydrated for the day!
The staff is great... The bums are a real problem!!!! They will follow you all the way to the register asking you to buy them food... It's a cheap, easy, reliable cup of coffee in the AM though!
Have always wanted to eat there. My hubby and I finally did, regretably. Found our hamburgers very disappointing. The burger meat tasted more like meatloaf, not like a nice quality grilled burger.

So I was staying at the King George hotel on mason and decided to walk to the corner and get a large drink from this jack in the box today. Unfortunately, like many large cities homeless people are all over these fast food restaurants. Today when I got here a homeless man (nice guy) wanted to get his sandwich with a coupon when he was not given service because of his condition I offered to buy him the sand which and also get him a large drink a total of 3 large drinks and a sandwich. When they started calling numbers for orders that were fulfilled all but mine was called. About 10 numbers after mine I asked the gentleman distributing these orders (Jo) what happened with my order one that I myself thought was very simple compared to others after me.( I don't work in the fast food industry but assume pouring a drink is pretty simple.) He responded "oh let me get it for you". What makes me even more upset is the fact that if I didn't ask I would have waited 20 more mins for some drinks. All because I bought a homeless man they don't like food. SF isn't what I expected , coming from a diverse background like this city I would assume they had more respect . Even these trashy places seem to not care about people.
Stuffed jalapeños and Curly fries is what I would prefer the best always. They taste absolutely delicious!!!!!!!
Ate here while waiting for an appointment in downtown San Francisco.  Fast friendly service.  Clean dining room.  Was funny to see businessmen having meetings with their Chinese counterparts in the dining room of a Jack in the Box.  Must be fairly common, because there were a lot of them in there.  Maybe they can't get enough of the awesome curly fries.
I see you judging me. Yeah, I eat at Jack in the Box once in a while. Yeah, I'm actually rating them on Yelp, and yeah, I just gave them 4 stars. Why? Their customer service. Seriously. This location deals with SO MUCH shit. Crazy people, drug addicts, drunk bros and drunken party girls spilling out of Ruby Skye and other nearby clubs and bars, acting like a-holes... and you know what? The staff handles it. I have been to this Jack in the Box more times than I wish to share with you. Sometimes drunk, sometimes hungover, sometimes sober. And I watch them deal with the shit. And they are nice, they have always gotten my order right, and it looks like they bust their ass as a team. I seriously want to write a letter to whoever owns this particular location, and tell them that they are damn lucky to have that staff. Most fast food joints, no matter where you go, are full of employees that could give 2 shits about how many tacos you ordered, or that you would like extra ranch on the side. And the staff here gives it their 100%. I hope the higher ups recognize it. If you ever go to this location, and you aren't too drunk to notice, watch the staff. They kill it!One time I was hungover and stopped at Jack in the Box on my way to work. I ordered 26 tacos and took them to my older co-workers. They looked around at each other, seeing if they would be judged by one another for eating these tasty greasy morsels at 8 AM, and then they dug into the bag like a bunch of vultures around a dead zebra. I'm pretty sure I made everyone's day.
I like Jack in the Box a lot! This location is always open so I can get food anytime!! I am addicted to their Spicy Chicken Burger. It's pretty filling with cheese or more crisp and refreshing with extra lettuce. They have Tacos 2 for 99cents. Don't expext anything exciting. They make for a nice cheap snack. The monster Tacos is bigger and around $1.5 ish but its too large to bite efficiently and so it's not as fun to eat.The Chicken Sandwich is also cheap its like a chicken nugget patty with a lettuce leaf. Good for when you don't want to chew real chicken you know. The Chicken Nuggets are alright. More expensive than McDonalds and the sauce selections are nowhere as food but it'll do. The Crispy Chicken Strips aren't very crispy and a bit dry, the texture is unexciting. I LOVE their Curly Fries. So fun!! Very flavorful. Can be a bit salty at times. Their normal Fries is kinda whatever. The Bacon Cheddar Potato wedges is too carby fatty for my taste. They used to have chorizo cheese fried which I was addicted to. The Mini Churros is fun to eat too. They bite-sizes and crispy with this curstardy filling. Don't expect too much, they're not Michelin quality - they're good for what they are. I think the ice cream shakes are a bit too thich. It's difficult to drink them theough the straw and that really hurt my cheeks. All the Cheeseburger / Hamburger varieties are pretty allright. Theyre soft and easy to chew and swallow. Good enough for me. They don't have a lasting impression or anything thought. The Munchie Meals are too crazy. They are overloaded with cheese it's impossible for me to finish but if you've been starbing for days or want a challenge then just try them out. Available after 9pm only, I think. I like Hash Browns. They have acceptable has browns. I really like their Breakfast Platter, especially the mini pancakes. So soft and cute and spongy and sweet. Breakfast is available allllllllll day. The Chicken Club salad is kinda boring. Normal. Fresh enough. I like the Southwest Chicken Salad better. They have corn!! Haha. I like the Crispy Chicken that comes with the salad a lot better than the chicken strips. These will actually be crispy.
I have lived up the hill from this place for three decades.I seldom go in unless I'm starved; if you like burgers their's are OK if you are not a foodie.  My problems with them have always been this location is a difficult place to have a meal without hassles.Today I ordered a combo meal and asked for it to be supersized as I did not eat breakfast.  It appeared the gal at the counter did not understand so i asked her to read back the order and she kept getting it regular sized three times.She just did not get it I wanted it supersized.  I almost pulled my $10 off of the counter to leave when a supervisor stepped in and showed the gal how to enter it in the computer.After all of these hassles I just wanted to eat and leave.  When my order was coming up the supervisor decided to go in the back leaving one kid on the counter.  So my order and several others sat in the heater ignored by the remaing counter guy.While we were waiting a street tough comes in and panhandle all people waiting for their food or to order.  What you do on the street is your business but any business which allows street people to hassle diners, people waiting for their food or people waiting to order is clueless.Overall I've had enough of this place and probably will not go back in for another couple of years due to the hassles - it is easier to go to McDonalds.Yes, I'm not a foodie!
This place is a freak show. Great entertainment value! Between the random homeless guys coughing their tuberculous all over, the head cases talking to themselves, and the free music from next door it's a win win!
Getting to San Francisco around 2am, we were left with little option for late night eats. Luckily Jack in the Box was big, bright, and stood out in the darkness.Given the drunken crowd on a Friday night, I was glad there was a security guard to let us in. This was a bit odd, but we were hungry, so to hell with it. The workers at the counter should be awarded a medal; they were fast, clear, and didn't get daunted by the plethora of people slurring menu items.Late night menu, what a god send. For $6: Two tacos, curly fries, a drink, and an epic grilled cheese/cheeseburger. Food coma be damned, that's value!If you can deal with a large drunken mess of people, not a bad option for cheap late night eating.
My experience with most Jack in the box locations have been good minus this location. I asked for a munchie meal and the Russian lady asked me what I wanted for my drink. I asked her to pour water into the cup with no ice. She gives me my receipt and I see that bottled water was added to the receipt. I told her I did not want bottled water, only water poured into the cup. Then she stands there arguing with me why she had put bottled water in my receipt instead of giving me the water in the cup for the next ten minutes. After that she takes out the freebie cup and puts water into that. Omg. How hard is it to use the water from the machine and pour water into the standard sized cup that comes with the meal? She gets frustrated and clearly did not want to pour water into the small sized cup and went out of her way to give me this attitude. I'd give this place zero stars if there is that option, just because of the poor training they have given to the early morning cashier. I mean how can you possibly not understand, please pour water into the cup. Don't give me what I didn't ask for.
It's one of those days; you're sick and just need to get some food in your belly so the medicine will sit better.  Hubby and I walked to the ol' Jack in hopes of getting a breakfast sandwich to satisfy our tired bodies.  We got to our destination and there was about half a dozen folks waiting for their order.  They were supposed to have a 2 for $4 deal on their croissant breakfast sandwiches; apparently this location did not participate in this deal.  Oh well, we were still hungry and a few extra dollars wouldn't kill us.I ordered two Supreme Breakfast Croissants with hashbrowns.  I waited... and waited.. and waited.  But that's okay, we figured, it will be worth the wait!We got home (less than 10 minutes later), broke open the bag and wrapper and took a bite.  The croissant was soggy and the ham was SOOOO salty. I literally thought I would have a coronary just after one bite!Good thing I had my coffee to wash it down, but no one said salty coffee was a good thing.  Hubby and I barely could finish it, but we looked at the bright side; at least the sandwich made us drink more water and we'll stay hydrated for the day!
The staff is great... The bums are a real problem!!!! They will follow you all the way to the register asking you to buy them food... It's a cheap, easy, reliable cup of coffee in the AM though!
Have always wanted to eat there. My hubby and I finally did, regretably. Found our hamburgers very disappointing. The burger meat tasted more like meatloaf, not like a nice quality grilled burger.
Well, this review is mainly for their sides or how they call it sandwich sidekicks!!Stuffed Jalapenos, Onion Rings, Seasoned Curly Fries - All I can say is YUM YUM YUM!!! And, for sure I've become a huge fan of all three, Yayyyy!!! They taste so awesomely delicious, fried stuff but not dripping oily at all (I'm super impressed), very reasonably priced and comes in with different serving sizes too.Stuffed Jalapenos ($2.19 & $4.19) - 3 piece and 7 piece; Cheese StuffingOnion Rings ($2.29) - Just one portion size of about 97g; CrispySeasoned Curly Fries ($1.99, $2.29 & $2.49) - Small, Medium & Large; very tasty and cooked justly at the right heating temperatureThis facility was maintained clean, friendly staff at the bill counters with ample good high chair-round table seatings. I wouldn't say that the order was served real quick, but the wait time was neither too long. Great to learn that this spot is opened 24hours and is located at the heart of Downtown SF, big bonus to all night owls!!Parking Tip, Street parking only!
Jack in the Box needs to improve a lot of their items.Too many JiTB items are dry and flavorless, and yet pricey at the same time. A typical burger here costs $4-6, which would be fine if their food tastes better.For me, their biggest problem is their french fry quality. It's bland and dry, especially compared to BK and McDs, both of those places take pride in their fries' quality. When i go to McDs, the french fries are a big highlight for me.They mess up the curly fries too. They are one of the few fast food places that offer curly fries and yet they mess it up. It's a simple thing to do, start selling better fries!
Whoever was working on register tonight (first hours of 31st of january) is a thieve. I asked for medium size 12th meal (chicken) and she asked for 11$. (I was like this should cost less than that but did not insist). After I started driving my car, i realized that she also sold(!) me chicken tinders. Fuck this place and that employee seriously.
Stopped in here later at night since we were walking by and have never tasted anything from this chain.  There was a long line but we waited since we had to check out the menu.  They offer a "value" menu so we ordered the jr. bacon cheeseburger, big cheeseburger and the jr. Jack.  These sizes were just right for a snack at a good price.  The burgers tasted good and I would try other items from this chain.The only thing about this location was the front doors were wide open and many less fortunate people were approaching customers for money or food.
I dont see why people complain its a damn Jack in the Box not some fancy restaurant. Anyways it tastes the same as  any jack you go to. Open 24hrs which is a plus. The times I've went staff is always great to me & i get my food quick! But I would also recommend to get your food to go, there are always homeless people inside asking for money or your food, but thats just a normal thing in SF!
Other than a few drunks or bums in and out of this place, I still love their food! Typical fast-food but still yummy! Cheap, fattening and unhealthy but ain't gonna lie.. I love grease :) Their crispy curly fries are seasoned well. Egg-rolls are still crispy and yummm with the sauce. Chicken strips tender in the inside and crispy on the outside. I must say their buttermilk sauce which is like ranch sauce is still thick and very delish for dipping those finger foods! Actually all their sauces are better than most fast-food joints. I don't know why but I like their tacos. Maybe cause I grew up eating it and probably got used to it or something. I'll always come back here! Oh and one last thing.. I praise those workers for trying to have more patience especially when Ruby Skye is active lol.
It's your standard Jack In the Box that's open 24hr and located super close to Ruby Skye, so a reasonable post-EDM food stop before heading home. You might get some weird people here and there, and wait-times for food can be variable, but it's nothing out-of-the-ordinary for your venue and location (or hour of day).
