I'm really impress with Umami Burger. I'm talking about everything from customer service to the food. The waiters/waitresses are really kind, helpful and attentive. It's hard to find that nowadays. Funny story, there's a sushi restaurant a block away. It happens to be called "Umami" as well. I actually stopped in on accident, looked at the menu, did not see any burgers, and was told that they stopped serving at 9:00 p.m. (checked the clock and it was only 8:50 p.m.). Thank goodness that the bartender denied my service because it led to me "Umami Burger". I checked the address again and happy to find out that I made a stop at the wrong restaurant. I walked in, found a seat and was politely greeted by my waiter. The menu was simple and not overwhelming with choices. I ordered "The Original" with a side of the truffle cheese fries. The burger was a simple burger and totally on point! The fries were amazing! I'm a fan of thin fries! The waiter was the REAL M.V.P. He brought out 4 different kinds of homemade sauce without me having to ask.
The truffle fries are soo good. and the sweet potato fries are sooo goood (they have bits of bacon in them... that warrants a few extra o's, right?)I've only had one burger off of their standard menu, the manly burger (haha) which was delicious. it had like onion string things and bacon (always makes everything better). I've also had one of their celebrity burgers, the alton burger, which had bacon in the patty and on the burger (I. Know.), a smashed tater tot, fried egg, and coffee ketchup (sounds weird. tastes awesome.) Plus, of the sales of the celebrity burgers also go to charity which is great!
throwback.   what a juice!  mouthful.  dripping all over....  so good I eat 2 of them... truffle fries.    of course.
What do you think of when you hear the word 'umami'? Something hot & savory, something with MSG. To me, my grandmother's noodle soup is rich with umami, a steaming hot bowl that warms me up from the inside out. A burger is not the first thing that comes to my mind, but these burgers sure taste good. Obviously the guys at Umami Burger think truffle is the key to umami flavor.With a name like Umami Burger, I thought the chain served overrated burgers with a bunch of random toppings and the burgers would have nothing to do with the umami flavor. Well I wasn't exactly correct. Thick, juicy patties + soft, fluffy buns = very good burger! These burgers with the signature U-stamped buns look a little small at first glance, but they're rather thick actually. The thick beef patties are cooked to a medium rare - juicy & pink in the middle. The cheese is nicely melted over the patty. & their 20-yr aged parmesan frico? That is one excellent wafer-thin piece of fried cheese. Put that on everything.$12 Umami - Parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, Umami ketchup (was once the Original): Good! The shiitake and roasted tomato had smokey and woodsy flavors, while the caramelized onions brought in sweet notes. The best part was the parmesan frico, of course.$13 Manly - house beer-cheddar cheese, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami ketchup, mustard spread:Great! I couldn't really taste beer in the cheese, but it was nicely melted. Bacon lardons & onion strings were fried, crunchy, salty goodness.$14 Sunny Side - beef patty, Parmesan frico, fried egg, truffle butter, truffled arugula (was once the Truffle Especiale):Great! I think this might be my favorite of all the ones I've tried. Fried egg & fried cheese, that's a beautiful combination. The egg is cooked perfectly with the silky egg white encompassing smooth yolk in the center. The arugula adds just a bit of bitterness to break up the rich flavors. One of my friends tried to flip the egg upside down so that the egg yolk would run over the arugula. That's actually a genius idea. Too bad he dropped the slippery egg and it splattered onto the paper placemat. $13 Truffle Burger - beef, roasted garlic aioli, truffle cheese, truffle glaze:Not bad! A lot of people think truffle is pungent and robust with flavor, but I think it is very mild and often hard to detect. Even in this burger, I couldn't really taste the mild mushroom flavor. This is a very classic and simple burger. I think the "Truffle" burger should be named their "Original" or signature "Umami" burger and they should rename the Umami burger the Parm Burger or something. Remember the Bacon-Wrapped Scallop Burger - scallop patty topped with crispy pork belly, sweet chili sauce & yuzu garlic aioli, the once-exclusive to Union St. burger? It wasn't good, but I won't get into an item that's no longer on the menu.$5.50 Truffle Fries - thin cut fries w/ house truffle cheese, topped w/ chives:Fries...I'll take 'em or leave 'em, but the truffle cheese & chives really make it something special. Crunchy & salty thin fries. The truffle cheese has a thin enough consistency so the fries don't get all stuck together.What happened to the gravy fries? I liked those too, but didn't like the shredded pork topping.The decor is a nod to Japanese accents, but I don't get what that has to do with the food. They don't use any Japanese ingredients, except perhaps in the ahi tuna dishes. Anyhow, still a pretty nice venue with a wooden theme, curved bar, and swords on the walls. I've experienced very good service every time I've eaten here. However, I ordered for pick-up once and it was super slow.I still don't think these burgers evoke the taste or the sensation of umami, but I do think these are one of the best burgers you can get for a mid-range price.Now, how many people think the logo looks like a pair of lips?
My favorite BURGER joint in the city! Yes, its on the higher price for a burger but they are so good. Especially with their amazing sides, you can't go wrong. When I want somewhere nice to sit, cozy atomphere and enjoy a perfectly cooked burger, I'm coming to Umami. All other times, on the go, super duper would do. My favorites are **Manly Burger comes with cheddar cheese, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami ketchup, mustard spread. Perfect burger to feel like a man. haha the burger isn't too big. Bacon goes perfect with burgers. Medium rare is perfect! When I want something lighter, I get the **Sunny Side Burger comes with a fried egg, So good but messy. You can add an egg to any of your burgers. I love their **Truffle Fries - thin cut fries with house truffle cheese, topped with chives. So freaken yummy! I can have 2 orders of that myself. YUM!!! Also I always get their cheesey totes, off their menu but if you ask for it, they will make it for you. I love coming to this location. The wait can be long depending on the day. But they take your number and text you when your table is almost ready.
Time is a valuable gift. It's something that you cannot get back once it passes.We always say, "I don't have the time to do this or that. I just don't have the time.."Well, I made time for a long leisurely lunch at Umami after power shopping on Union St. Oddly enough, I didn't want to try the burger. But I was in the mood for truffle.I'm always in the mood for truffle ANYTHING.The truffled beet salad is a wonderful thing of beauty. Piled high with peppery arugula, roasted beets, truffled ricotta & goat cheese, a healthy handful of smoked almonds and truffle dressing. OH MY GAH. Where can I get that truffle dressing?! I would eat more veggies every day!And of course, my downfall. Crispy thin fried sticks of potatoes. Yum. The truffled fries with melted parmesan was exactly what I needed to balance out the super healthy salad. What's a leisurely lunch without a glass of vino? a generous pour of 2013 Laurenz Singing Gruner Veltliner: apple/citrus aromas with a touch of spiciness that the wine is known for and only $9!Since I came at lunch right when they opened, there were plenty of seats available and other singe diners as well. I cherish dining alone. I enjoy and eat my food more slowly. I also find that the wait staff take the extra effort to engage in conversation.With a good first time experience, I will return and get the famous burger. It's just a matter of time.
This was my first time dinning at Umami Burger and I loved it! I heard about it before from friends, and then also an episode on 'The Profit' so when I saw it I had to try it.The Food: Easily put, it was simple, but delicious. They really know how to make a good burger! I got the Sunnyside Burger and I wasn't disappointed. It was a perfect blend of Egg, Truffle Oil, Arugula. It leaves you wanting to to come back for sure!If you haven't tried this place, and you're near one you need to get there ASAP!
Great buns, but overall, decent burgers. I've been to multiple locations prior, and I would say this one has the best service by far. I took my best friend here for dinner after a well day spent in SF. We both ordered pretty basic burgers: The Cali and Throwback + truffle fries. I had the Throwback which consisted of two thin patties. It was good, but really reminded me of my childhood days when I used to* eat double cheese burgers from Burger King, but! With a twist of truffle. Lol. And this may be due to the mustard. It was still tasty.. But I think after this meal, I discovered that Umami is not the place for me. I feel that their "truffle" is pretty overwhelming. Every burger I ever had from Umami were cooked with truffle oil, and it's always TOOO* truffled. Although I have a change of heart about this burger joint, I'm still giving them 4 stars for great service and buns! I'm just no longer a fan of their truffle. I'll stick to my truffle fries at Yardhouse! P.s. I actually do really like their homemade ketchup!
Never was I a really big fan of burgers... But this place really changed my outlook of burgers! My boyfriend and I was seated at the bar and was greeted by the bar server. He's super friendly and asked us if it's our first time here. We told him it is our first time and he told us everything we had to know about thier burgers how they use ground beef etc. I got the most simple burger (like I said not a fan burgers) Cali Burger with a side of sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got the Sunny Side burger with a side of truffle fries. Our food came out quick and it was very good! I also got a mimosa as well, pretty good here from all the mimosa I have tried before. Overall customer service, the environment, the place, and the good is really good. 5 stars from me! Will definitely be recommending this place and coming back whenever I'm in the city!
Was going through my reviews and this one definitely needed an update. Food quality has completely gone down hill since my last review. It's not just this Umami, it's the same issue at Palo Alto and I'm sure all of their locations. The burgers are a far cry from what they once were. It seems like they had to cut costs and decided to let the food quality take the hit. I used to love to come to Umami and felt it was a great stop for out of town guests. No more. It's been let down after let down every time I try to give them another shot. If you are looking for a good burger keep on moving. If you just want a place to stop with friends, have a few beers, and don't really care about what you're eating then step right up.
4 out of 5 for sure. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was a fantastic burger with some even more fantastic beers on the menu. The meat was wonderful and cooked perfectly and the tots are something to covet. I see why this place is so successful. The restaurant is clean and tastefully decorated giving a great overall experience. Thanks Umami.
I've been to a fair share of Unami's around California and I will say in confidence, this was one of my favorite experiences!This Unami Burger is nestled in the beautiful Marina. It's a small restaurant with a bar area and seating for 2 people to groups of 10. Even though the seating is limited, the service is fast and enjoyable. I went with a friend on a Friday night around 7pm. We were spending the evening out in the city and both were craving hamburgers, so naturally Unami came to mind. When we entered the dimly lit restaurant, we were greeted by a cheery hostess who managed to seat us right away. Our server, Paul, came to our table shortly after and helped us navigate through the menu. I ordered the Unami Burger and my friend ordered the KBBQ burger with sweet potato fries. We both asked our burgers to be cooked medium-rare and got exactly that! Once again, my taste buds were not disappointed with Unami's food. And I actually preferred the cozier atmosphere of this Unami compared to the one in downtown Oakland.However, street parking is a pain here, but with enough driving around, you're bound to find something haha but it's worth it for the food!
Excellent burgers. A little on the pricey side. But very different than what regular burger places have to offer. My favorites are their sunny-side up, throwback and truffle burgers. Their house made sauces are the best! Truffle fries are thin cut and crunchy (yummy), but onion rings were a little too oily for my taste (you could see a layer of oil at the bottom of the bowl in which it was served)
I heard the burgers we decent here so wanted to give it a try. I waited at the bar for 15 minutes for a staff/waiter to take my order (during a non-busy time) but the waiter kept ignoring me while taking other people's orders or texting/chatting on the phone. Eventually I ask "Can I place an order?" and the waiter put his finger within a few inches of my face and said "just wait, I'll be with you soon." No thank you. Never going back here. Burgers are bad for your health anyway.
Truffle burger. Get the truffle burger. Please send me a truffle burger when finished. Get the truffle burger. This simplistic place is a local chain from what I have been told. Usually when a place becomes a chain it looses something. Some quality, some service, SOMETHING. Not this place. My truffle burger was one of the top 2 burgers I have ever had. It was dripping all over my plate with juicy, cheesy goodness. I ate whatever fell out of my burger. Our server was decent. Our waters weren't empty and he checked on us to make sure everything was ok (I found many places just dropped our food and didn't come back until everything was finished while in San Francisco).Go here. Don't split the burger like I did. Send me one when you're finished.
A more upscale burger joint in a middle class area. Is it worth what you pay for? Well, if you're looking for cheap burgers, maybe you should stick with McD's. I was more than satisfied with what I thought was a great combo, the Truffle Burger w/ Truffle Cheese Fries. The patty is thick, cooked perfect to a medium rare and not overwhelmed with any needed condiments. The fries complimented the burger well. Service was standard, ok at best. Overall, not a "WOW" experience, though I'd return.
Where do I even start! This place is heaven! Whenever I crave for a burger, this is the place to go. My friend and I sat at the bar and Paul took care of us till closing. (We came in at 9 PM) Great customer service! I love how he interacted with us, including educating us about the beers they offer.I ordered a Manly burger and Manly fries. And let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS af! Their alcohol selection just tops off the whole place. I got something simple, sparking wine. Just to lighten it up with the burger. Everything was just wonderful; the environment, the people, the food, the drinks. THUMBS UP!
4 stars for a fancy delicious burger joint. Kind of on the pricy side, $40 for 2 relatively small burgers, but I guess it's actually a good thing so that way I didn't stuff my face with a huge burger lol. My burger was so tasty and although it seemed small, I was stuffed and still had a few bites left. The atmosphere and servers were delightful. I will definitely be back!
Unfortunately this was bit disappointing!Saw the photos for the truffle burger on yelp and decided to come try it. The truffle burger is pretty good but nothing special. It's hard to definitively say that the Umami burger is better than burgers and any other gourmet burger places--so that was disappointing. Maybe it's because of high expectations? The price is also a bit high.The service is was pretty good. The inside is also quite well decorated. Can imagine there'd be a lot of people visit for dinner.Overall, an OK burger place
I don't see what the hype is with this place... This is the second time I've tried umami burger and both have left me unimpressed. We tried 4 burgers between my friend and me, lol. We got the throwback, manly, ahi tuna, and kbbq. Maybe it's because I don't like the house made ketchup very much, but even if you remove that, the burgers are nothing special. The manly burger was the best. The Kbbq was unique and my 2nd favorite of the 4. Both the throwback and ahi tied for worst. The real sugar Mountain Dew was the highlight of my experience here. The onion rings were good too but as I mentioned before, they have their own special ketchup and I'm not a fan.
I'm really impress with Umami Burger. I'm talking about everything from customer service to the food. The waiters/waitresses are really kind, helpful and attentive. It's hard to find that nowadays. Funny story, there's a sushi restaurant a block away. It happens to be called "Umami" as well.

Unfortunately this was bit disappointing!Saw the photos for the truffle burger on yelp and decided to come try it. The truffle burger is pretty good but nothing special. It's hard to definitively say that the Umami burger is better than burgers and any other gourmet burger places--so that was disappointing. Maybe it's because of high expectations? The price is also a bit high.The service is was pretty good. The inside is also quite well decorated. Can imagine there'd be a lot of people visit for dinner.Overall, an OK burger place
I don't see what the hype is with this place... This is the second time I've tried umami burger and both have left me unimpressed. We tried 4 burgers between my friend and me, lol. We got the throwback, manly, ahi tuna, and kbbq. Maybe it's because I don't like the house made ketchup very much, but even if you remove that, the burgers are nothing special. The manly burger was the best. The Kbbq was unique and my 2nd favorite of the 4. Both the throwback and ahi tied for worst. The real sugar Mountain Dew was the highlight of my experience here. The onion rings were good too but as I mentioned before, they have their own special ketchup and I'm not a fan.
I'm really impress with Umami Burger. I'm talking about everything from customer service to the food. The waiters/waitresses are really kind, helpful and attentive. It's hard to find that nowadays. Funny story, there's a sushi restaurant a block away. It happens to be called "Umami" as well. I actually stopped in on accident, looked at the menu, did not see any burgers, and was told that they stopped serving at 9:00 p.m. (checked the clock and it was only 8:50 p.m.). Thank goodness that the bartender denied my service because it led to me "Umami Burger". I checked the address again and happy to find out that I made a stop at the wrong restaurant. I walked in, found a seat and was politely greeted by my waiter. The menu was simple and not overwhelming with choices. I ordered "The Original" with a side of the truffle cheese fries. The burger was a simple burger and totally on point! The fries were amazing! I'm a fan of thin fries! The waiter was the REAL M.V.P. He brought out 4 different kinds of homemade sauce without me having to ask.
The truffle fries are soo good. and the sweet potato fries are sooo goood (they have bits of bacon in them... that warrants a few extra o's, right?)I've only had one burger off of their standard menu, the manly burger (haha) which was delicious. it had like onion string things and bacon (always makes everything better). I've also had one of their celebrity burgers, the alton burger, which had bacon in the patty and on the burger (I. Know.), a smashed tater tot, fried egg, and coffee ketchup (sounds weird. tastes awesome.) Plus, of the sales of the celebrity burgers also go to charity which is great!
throwback.   what a juice!  mouthful.  dripping all over....  so good I eat 2 of them... truffle fries.    of course.
What do you think of when you hear the word 'umami'? Something hot & savory, something with MSG. To me, my grandmother's noodle soup is rich with umami, a steaming hot bowl that warms me up from the inside out. A burger is not the first thing that comes to my mind, but these burgers sure taste good. Obviously the guys at Umami Burger think truffle is the key to umami flavor.With a name like Umami Burger, I thought the chain served overrated burgers with a bunch of random toppings and the burgers would have nothing to do with the umami flavor. Well I wasn't exactly correct. Thick, juicy patties + soft, fluffy buns = very good burger! These burgers with the signature U-stamped buns look a little small at first glance, but they're rather thick actually. The thick beef patties are cooked to a medium rare - juicy & pink in the middle. The cheese is nicely melted over the patty. & their 20-yr aged parmesan frico? That is one excellent wafer-thin piece of fried cheese. Put that on everything.$12 Umami - Parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, Umami ketchup (was once the Original): Good! The shiitake and roasted tomato had smokey and woodsy flavors, while the caramelized onions brought in sweet notes. The best part was the parmesan frico, of course.$13 Manly - house beer-cheddar cheese, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami ketchup, mustard spread:Great! I couldn't really taste beer in the cheese, but it was nicely melted. Bacon lardons & onion strings were fried, crunchy, salty goodness.$14 Sunny Side - beef patty, Parmesan frico, fried egg, truffle butter, truffled arugula (was once the Truffle Especiale):Great! I think this might be my favorite of all the ones I've tried. Fried egg & fried cheese, that's a beautiful combination. The egg is cooked perfectly with the silky egg white encompassing smooth yolk in the center. The arugula adds just a bit of bitterness to break up the rich flavors. One of my friends tried to flip the egg upside down so that the egg yolk would run over the arugula. That's actually a genius idea. Too bad he dropped the slippery egg and it splattered onto the paper placemat. $13 Truffle Burger - beef, roasted garlic aioli, truffle cheese, truffle glaze:Not bad! A lot of people think truffle is pungent and robust with flavor, but I think it is very mild and often hard to detect. Even in this burger, I couldn't really taste the mild mushroom flavor. This is a very classic and simple burger. I think the "Truffle" burger should be named their "Original" or signature "Umami" burger and they should rename the Umami burger the Parm Burger or something. Remember the Bacon-Wrapped Scallop Burger - scallop patty topped with crispy pork belly, sweet chili sauce & yuzu garlic aioli, the once-exclusive to Union St. burger? It wasn't good, but I won't get into an item that's no longer on the menu.$5.50 Truffle Fries - thin cut fries w/ house truffle cheese, topped w/ chives:Fries...I'll take 'em or leave 'em, but the truffle cheese & chives really make it something special. Crunchy & salty thin fries. The truffle cheese has a thin enough consistency so the fries don't get all stuck together.What happened to the gravy fries? I liked those too, but didn't like the shredded pork topping.The decor is a nod to Japanese accents, but I don't get what that has to do with the food. They don't use any Japanese ingredients, except perhaps in the ahi tuna dishes. Anyhow, still a pretty nice venue with a wooden theme, curved bar, and swords on the walls. I've experienced very good service every time I've eaten here. However, I ordered for pick-up once and it was super slow.I still don't think these burgers evoke the taste or the sensation of umami, but I do think these are one of the best burgers you can get for a mid-range price.Now, how many people think the logo looks like a pair of lips?
My favorite BURGER joint in the city! Yes, its on the higher price for a burger but they are so good. Especially with their amazing sides, you can't go wrong. When I want somewhere nice to sit, cozy atomphere and enjoy a perfectly cooked burger, I'm coming to Umami. All other times, on the go, super duper would do. My favorites are **Manly Burger comes with cheddar cheese, bacon lardons, smoked-salt onion strings, Umami ketchup, mustard spread. Perfect burger to feel like a man. haha the burger isn't too big. Bacon goes perfect with burgers. Medium rare is perfect! When I want something lighter, I get the **Sunny Side Burger comes with a fried egg, So good but messy. You can add an egg to any of your burgers. I love their **Truffle Fries - thin cut fries with house truffle cheese, topped with chives. So freaken yummy! I can have 2 orders of that myself. YUM!!! Also I always get their cheesey totes, off their menu but if you ask for it, they will make it for you. I love coming to this location. The wait can be long depending on the day. But they take your number and text you when your table is almost ready.
Time is a valuable gift. It's something that you cannot get back once it passes.We always say, "I don't have the time to do this or that. I just don't have the time.."Well, I made time for a long leisurely lunch at Umami after power shopping on Union St. Oddly enough, I didn't want to try the burger. But I was in the mood for truffle.I'm always in the mood for truffle ANYTHING.The truffled beet salad is a wonderful thing of beauty. Piled high with peppery arugula, roasted beets, truffled ricotta & goat cheese, a healthy handful of smoked almonds and truffle dressing. OH MY GAH. Where can I get that truffle dressing?! I would eat more veggies every day!And of course, my downfall. Crispy thin fried sticks of potatoes. Yum. The truffled fries with melted parmesan was exactly what I needed to balance out the super healthy salad. What's a leisurely lunch without a glass of vino? a generous pour of 2013 Laurenz Singing Gruner Veltliner: apple/citrus aromas with a touch of spiciness that the wine is known for and only $9!Since I came at lunch right when they opened, there were plenty of seats available and other singe diners as well. I cherish dining alone. I enjoy and eat my food more slowly. I also find that the wait staff take the extra effort to engage in conversation.With a good first time experience, I will return and get the famous burger. It's just a matter of time.
This was my first time dinning at Umami Burger and I loved it! I heard about it before from friends, and then also an episode on 'The Profit' so when I saw it I had to try it.The Food: Easily put, it was simple, but delicious. They really know how to make a good burger! I got the Sunnyside Burger and I wasn't disappointed. It was a perfect blend of Egg, Truffle Oil, Arugula. It leaves you wanting to to come back for sure!If you haven't tried this place, and you're near one you need to get there ASAP!
Great buns, but overall, decent burgers. I've been to multiple locations prior, and I would say this one has the best service by far. I took my best friend here for dinner after a well day spent in SF. We both ordered pretty basic burgers: The Cali and Throwback + truffle fries. I had the Throwback which consisted of two thin patties. It was good, but really reminded me of my childhood days when I used to* eat double cheese burgers from Burger King, but! With a twist of truffle. Lol. And this may be due to the mustard. It was still tasty.. But I think after this meal, I discovered that Umami is not the place for me. I feel that their "truffle" is pretty overwhelming. Every burger I ever had from Umami were cooked with truffle oil, and it's always TOOO* truffled. Although I have a change of heart about this burger joint, I'm still giving them 4 stars for great service and buns! I'm just no longer a fan of their truffle. I'll stick to my truffle fries at Yardhouse! P.s. I actually do really like their homemade ketchup!
Never was I a really big fan of burgers... But this place really changed my outlook of burgers! My boyfriend and I was seated at the bar and was greeted by the bar server. He's super friendly and asked us if it's our first time here. We told him it is our first time and he told us everything we had to know about thier burgers how they use ground beef etc. I got the most simple burger (like I said not a fan burgers) Cali Burger with a side of sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got the Sunny Side burger with a side of truffle fries. Our food came out quick and it was very good! I also got a mimosa as well, pretty good here from all the mimosa I have tried before. Overall customer service, the environment, the place, and the good is really good. 5 stars from me! Will definitely be recommending this place and coming back whenever I'm in the city!
Was going through my reviews and this one definitely needed an update. Food quality has completely gone down hill since my last review. It's not just this Umami, it's the same issue at Palo Alto and I'm sure all of their locations. The burgers are a far cry from what they once were. It seems like they had to cut costs and decided to let the food quality take the hit. I used to love to come to Umami and felt it was a great stop for out of town guests. No more. It's been let down after let down every time I try to give them another shot. If you are looking for a good burger keep on moving. If you just want a place to stop with friends, have a few beers, and don't really care about what you're eating then step right up.
4 out of 5 for sure. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was a fantastic burger with some even more fantastic beers on the menu. The meat was wonderful and cooked perfectly and the tots are something to covet. I see why this place is so successful. The restaurant is clean and tastefully decorated giving a great overall experience. Thanks Umami.
I've been to a fair share of Unami's around California and I will say in confidence, this was one of my favorite experiences!This Unami Burger is nestled in the beautiful Marina. It's a small restaurant with a bar area and seating for 2 people to groups of 10. Even though the seating is limited, the service is fast and enjoyable. I went with a friend on a Friday night around 7pm. We were spending the evening out in the city and both were craving hamburgers, so naturally Unami came to mind. When we entered the dimly lit restaurant, we were greeted by a cheery hostess who managed to seat us right away. Our server, Paul, came to our table shortly after and helped us navigate through the menu. I ordered the Unami Burger and my friend ordered the KBBQ burger with sweet potato fries. We both asked our burgers to be cooked medium-rare and got exactly that! Once again, my taste buds were not disappointed with Unami's food. And I actually preferred the cozier atmosphere of this Unami compared to the one in downtown Oakland.However, street parking is a pain here, but with enough driving around, you're bound to find something haha but it's worth it for the food!
Excellent burgers. A little on the pricey side. But very different than what regular burger places have to offer. My favorites are their sunny-side up, throwback and truffle burgers. Their house made sauces are the best! Truffle fries are thin cut and crunchy (yummy), but onion rings were a little too oily for my taste (you could see a layer of oil at the bottom of the bowl in which it was served)
I heard the burgers we decent here so wanted to give it a try. I waited at the bar for 15 minutes for a staff/waiter to take my order (during a non-busy time) but the waiter kept ignoring me while taking other people's orders or texting/chatting on the phone. Eventually I ask "Can I place an order?" and the waiter put his finger within a few inches of my face and said "just wait, I'll be with you soon." No thank you. Never going back here. Burgers are bad for your health anyway.
Truffle burger. Get the truffle burger. Please send me a truffle burger when finished. Get the truffle burger. This simplistic place is a local chain from what I have been told. Usually when a place becomes a chain it looses something. Some quality, some service, SOMETHING. Not this place. My truffle burger was one of the top 2 burgers I have ever had. It was dripping all over my plate with juicy, cheesy goodness. I ate whatever fell out of my burger. Our server was decent. Our waters weren't empty and he checked on us to make sure everything was ok (I found many places just dropped our food and didn't come back until everything was finished while in San Francisco).Go here. Don't split the burger like I did. Send me one when you're finished.
A more upscale burger joint in a middle class area. Is it worth what you pay for? Well, if you're looking for cheap burgers, maybe you should stick with McD's. I was more than satisfied with what I thought was a great combo, the Truffle Burger w/ Truffle Cheese Fries. The patty is thick, cooked perfect to a medium rare and not overwhelmed with any needed condiments. The fries complimented the burger well. Service was standard, ok at best. Overall, not a "WOW" experience, though I'd return.
Where do I even start! This place is heaven! Whenever I crave for a burger, this is the place to go. My friend and I sat at the bar and Paul took care of us till closing. (We came in at 9 PM) Great customer service! I love how he interacted with us, including educating us about the beers they offer.I ordered a Manly burger and Manly fries. And let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS af! Their alcohol selection just tops off the whole place. I got something simple, sparking wine. Just to lighten it up with the burger. Everything was just wonderful; the environment, the people, the food, the drinks. THUMBS UP!
4 stars for a fancy delicious burger joint. Kind of on the pricy side, $40 for 2 relatively small burgers, but I guess it's actually a good thing so that way I didn't stuff my face with a huge burger lol. My burger was so tasty and although it seemed small, I was stuffed and still had a few bites left. The atmosphere and servers were delightful. I will definitely be back!

A more upscale burger joint in a middle class area. Is it worth what you pay for? Well, if you're looking for cheap burgers, maybe you should stick with McD's. I was more than satisfied with what I thought was a great combo, the Truffle Burger w/ Truffle Cheese Fries. The patty is thick, cooked perfect to a medium rare and not overwhelmed with any needed condiments. The fries complimented the burger well. Service was standard, ok at best. Overall, not a "WOW" experience, though I'd return.
Where do I even start! This place is heaven! Whenever I crave for a burger, this is the place to go. My friend and I sat at the bar and Paul took care of us till closing. (We came in at 9 PM) Great customer service! I love how he interacted with us, including educating us about the beers they offer.I ordered a Manly burger and Manly fries. And let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS af! Their alcohol selection just tops off the whole place. I got something simple, sparking wine. Just to lighten it up with the burger. Everything was just wonderful; the environment, the people, the food, the drinks. THUMBS UP!
4 stars for a fancy delicious burger joint. Kind of on the pricy side, $40 for 2 relatively small burgers, but I guess it's actually a good thing so that way I didn't stuff my face with a huge burger lol. My burger was so tasty and although it seemed small, I was stuffed and still had a few bites left. The atmosphere and servers were delightful. I will definitely be back!
Unfortunately this was bit disappointing!Saw the photos for the truffle burger on yelp and decided to come try it. The truffle burger is pretty good but nothing special. It's hard to definitively say that the Umami burger is better than burgers and any other gourmet burger places--so that was disappointing. Maybe it's because of high expectations? The price is also a bit high.The service is was pretty good. The inside is also quite well decorated. Can imagine there'd be a lot of people visit for dinner.Overall, an OK burger place
I don't see what the hype is with this place... This is the second time I've tried umami burger and both have left me unimpressed. We tried 4 burgers between my friend and me, lol. We got the throwback, manly, ahi tuna, and kbbq. Maybe it's because I don't like the house made ketchup very much, but even if you remove that, the burgers are nothing special. The manly burger was the best. The Kbbq was unique and my 2nd favorite of the 4. Both the throwback and ahi tied for worst. The real sugar Mountain Dew was the highlight of my experience here. The onion rings were good too but as I mentioned before, they have their own special ketchup and I'm not a fan.
