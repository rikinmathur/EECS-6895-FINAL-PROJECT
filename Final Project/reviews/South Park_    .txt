Hands down the cutest, most charming little park to visit when having a picnic or when deciding to take a stroll.Lush and green, this park is smack dab in the middle of SOMA. Although very close to AT&T Ballpark, the Bay Bridge, two blocks away from Yerba Buena Gardens, and a short walk to Cal Trans; this park still feels hidden and peaceful in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the city.There's even a nice playground for all the kids to enjoy!Nice little restaurants and shops line the outside border of the park. It almost feels very European in a way in which it feels very family oriented, very intimate, and can also feel very country-like. Parking is straight booboo though and extremely difficult to find. Only metered and parallel parking in this location. Perfect, casual little spot to carve in some peace and quiet into your day!  Zen on!
So...alot of my friends have been posting pictures on Insta with "South Park" as the location.I realized I work 5 blocks away from this place so I decided to eat my lunch here. Pretty hidden park in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the work week. I thought I would be surrounded by techies/professionals but instead, there were lots of HOMELESS and young teens looking for trouble...Nevertheless, a great place to retreat from the stress of work!
Not for kids. Old equipment with a smashed snail spread all over one slide, old dirty sand, lots of wandering adults, some sort of police stop by an undercover car while we were here, dogs running off leash, people digging through trash cans....The grass is green and not a lot of litter.
too bad it is currently not accessible due to renovation and they are cutting down all the trees :(
Hidden Europe in the heart of SOMA. 2 hour parking, jack London alley...the secret to quick onramp at 2/Bryant for the BB....LOVE love this park. Ate lunch here recently on a super sunny, brilliant day.
Pretty cool except that strange lady on a bench rambling lines from The Lord of the Rings.
One of my favorite parks in SF, but still leaves much to be desired.  I like Cafe Centro and the Butler and the Chef.  Great during the week, but on Saturday only a few places are open, and on Sunday it's a complete ghost town.This is a great place to work, and seems like everyone at a startup agrees, yet there is no WiFi in the park or provided by any of the establishments around the park.  Every time I'm at the park, I witness a domestic dispute from the same house, and several times the police have been called.  It's a bit distracting and disturbing. The picnic benches are nice, but usually quite dirty and seem to never be in the sun.  And at least 1 or 2 of the benches are monopolized by a sleeping homeless person.
Update for the movie buffs: the ending scene of Blue Jasmine, where Cate Blanchett has officially lost her shit and is sitting on a park bench? That's South Park!There's not a lot to this park, but if you work in the area it's the perfect spot to eat lunch on a sunny day. Walk up with your to-go box, pop a squat on a bench, and maybe think of Cate Blanchett while you eat your food. A little warning: I overheard a gal in line at Mexico au Parc say that she's found hypodermic needles in the grass because the park apparently gets shady at night. Sit carefully!
Nice little park tucked away between 2nd and 3rd street. Great during the day but watch out for creepers at night. A few days ago, around 9PM, I decided to have a good sit in the park. The guy on the bench next to me was burping uncontrollably for about 40 minutes. At first I was annoyed but then I was impressed. How could someone consistently burp for 40 minutes? Amazing.There is a bike shop and a few cafes that surround the grassy patch. Make sure to look up their hours before venturing over; they are pretty limited on certain days.
Such a cute little park!It's right in the middle of SOMA and has tons of swings, benches and dogs running around. Very picturesque and I love the location.
This park has certainly changed a lot over the years, it truly is the little park that could!  I love that the City has been giving it it's much needed attention, it looks lovelier each time I come back.  I used to live a block away and would often be terrified walking my dog here, but there really wasn't any other choices!  There would be homeless people sleeping and/or pissing in every corner, shady characters roaming around, and trash everywhere.  Now it's entirely different!  Luxury shops, quaint little cafes, even the surrounding townhomes have been transformed into multi-million dollar cool contemporary properties!
So I read my horoscope today:"The day's planetary configuration indicates that you have a chance to express how you feel honestly and openly. It is also a great time to clear the air on any subject that may have become a sticking point, as there is genuine warmth and good feeling present."and guess what I noticed at the bottom?Astrocenter dot com is located in South Park! How appropriate! All the more reason to love... if only everyone could have an office in this gem of a park. Now I can be there in spirit every day when I read my sent-to-email Capricorn horoscope.
I love love love discovering new spots, and having been to SF sooo many times, I'm amazed I had never heard or seen this place before.That's what you get for hanging with locals.  This little circle feels every bit of Boston, or some sleepy corner of some bucolic European city.  It's that nice.  And doubly surprising to find it in SOMA the area of SF which is mostly warehouse-y and filled with conference halls and concrete.I wanna go back!
My daughter loves playing this local park despite the druggies and the homeless people that call this place home.  What can I do but take my daughter here when it's daylight and I have pepper spray in my pocket.
The little park that could.  This area has turned into an area of $$$ restaurants.  My uncle used to have a factory here.  How different it looks now, probably thanks to the tech/software/game companies nearby... and maybe the ballpark.It's still quaint, except flocked by cute restaurants.  I like the butler and the chef.  Pass on the American Grilled Cheese Kitchen, though.  Public Bikes is here; I like to window shop.
This is one of my favorite places to be in San Francisco. It's this perfect little oasis to escape to when I need a breather from the office. I really hope that they can maintain the charm this park has as they make updates (saw a renovation project plan a month or so ago).
We fought violently that day. He was freaking out because he had misplaced his keys. We had been all over SF and back, they could be anywhere. We ripped the car apart looking for those damn keys. For some reason, amidst his tantrum, I directed him back to South Park. Woman's intuition. He fought me tooth and nail. I slammed the door and walked off to the benches. Where the keys sat.  waiting. I would give anything to fight like that with him again. RIP BA.
I lived here, it was 5 min walk to work. All the major public trans lines go through here which makes it super conveinient. It's pretty dead after 5pm and when baseball is not in season. Its a good lunch spot for all the tech and start up companies in the area. Watch where you sit, lots of dog poop hiding amongst the grass.
Sadly, in San Francisco, most play structures are reserved for children, but not the one at South Park. In fact, I've never seen a child on it, only adults. Actually I've never seen anyone on anything but the swings.... probably because the structure is TERRIFYING!It has the world's highest monkey bars at 1.5 stories high. And, at the same height, it has parallel bars. Yes, basically a set of monkey bars without the horizontal bars, because, you know, monkey bars are too easy.This jungle gym was designed for giants. Or fearless Ninja Warrior wannabes. Or those who don't take fall damage.At least the poles are fun to slide down.
This park is a cute little respite in the city. We swing by here a couple times a year and I feel like everytime there is a new business opening up on the street surrounding the park.The park itself is a shady cute spot with both a toddler playground and older kid playground plus a grassy area where people play with their dogs. Despite the signs requiring dogs to be onleash, I have never seen a leashed dog here but all the dogs and owners seem to be happy and well-behaved.The playgrounds are nothing special, but as long as they have swings my little one is happy.The park also seems to come with an iguana. I know it must belong to someone but I don't know how. Perhaps someone abandoned a pet here. It is a huge iguana and parents should be wary because those things can a vicious bite. I also saw mice, so it can be a fun adventure in wildlife!interesting mixture of business people having lunch, old chinese men doing calisthenics, dog owners, homeless groups, and yuppies with babies (umm.. that last one may have just been me).

This park is a cute little respite in the city. We swing by here a couple times a year and I feel like everytime there is a new business opening up on the street surrounding the park.The park itself is a shady cute spot with both a toddler playground and older kid playground plus a grassy area where people play with their dogs. Despite the signs requiring dogs to be onleash, I have never seen a leashed dog here but all the dogs and owners seem to be happy and well-behaved.The playgrounds are nothing special, but as long as they have swings my little one is happy.The park also seems to come with an iguana. I know it must belong to someone but I don't know how. Perhaps someone abandoned a pet here. It is a huge iguana and parents should be wary because those things can a vicious bite. I also saw mice, so it can be a fun adventure in wildlife!interesting mixture of business people having lunch, old chinese men doing calisthenics, dog owners, homeless groups, and yuppies with babies (umm.. that last one may have just been me).
