Edgehill Mountain Park (well, technically an "Open Space"--I wonder what the difference is) is a beautiful slice of forested hillside on the southwest slope of Laguna Honda hill.  There is basically just one trail running across it from Knockash to Edgehill streets, and a couple of benches.  The views are limited a bit due to the trees, but it is still a very pretty place to walk through, especially at sunset.  In fact, the entirety of Laguna Honda Hill is very scenic, and I highly recommend walking up to the top while you're here.  Also, what is with those crazy shingled castle-mansions?  Someday I gotta get me one of those.It seems that there is a very active volunteer group that works in Edgehill Park doing habitat restoration and I've also seen proposals for a staircase down to Kensington Way, which would be awesome!  You can check out their website here: edgehill.net/Edgehill-Mo…
A little piece of nature is a large city
Edgehill Mountain's west side is an off-the-beaten and mostly undiscovered urban path, but I'm sure that's A-OK for this tucked-away neighborhood and its residents. To find this short trail, venture up to Knockash Hill (off of Ulloa) and find the trail entrance. You'll be rewarded with beautiful, but tree-filled views of West Portal, Miraloma Park, Mt. Davidson and the ocean. Finish this trek by walking down Edgehill Way to explore the Forest Hill Ext. area. It's a fun, nature-inspired walk through one of San Francisco's treasured neighborhoods. This location is within walking distance from Muni's Forest HIll station, and is also accessible from Muni's #36, #43 and #48 lines, among others.
Open space it is ;)
