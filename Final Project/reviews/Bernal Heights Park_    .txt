Great views of San Francisco! First time here, you get a 360 panoramic view compared to Lands End and such. Will bring my friend and the dogs to enjoy this open space. Not too crowded either. I was ably to find my neighborhood easily.
I am not sure why it took me so long to finally visit this park with my dogs. Truly it is a people and dog friendly place, where both can enjoy a stroll any time of the day. With 360 degree views of San Francisco, you'll want to mark this place as a spot to bring your out-of-town guests! I can only imagine what the views look like at night, with The City a-glow. The hike, which I would't really call a full on hike, is perhaps a 20-30 minute walk to the top. That is depending on your speed and whether your dog races to the top of course. The area is lush with Wildflowers, tall grass and California's State flower, the Poppy. Parking was extremely easy. I practically pulled into a spot at the park entrance at peak 12:30pm on a Sunday. Put on your walking shoes and go check it out!
Lovely view of SF from the southeast! Tips for visiting: - visit during the daytime (preferably on a sunny day) because you will be able to see really really far;- you can park at the base of the park and hike up (~10 min walk) or drive up to find street parking;- look for a paved road that leads to the top of the park (there is also a rocky road a bit further down the street, which is steeper and harder to walk on, but it will lead to the same place as the paved road);- there is tree at the top of the park and it has a rope with a handle bar tied to it. It's sturdy and you can swing on it;- the grass looks really green and soft but dogs pee and poop on it so be very careful where you want to lie down if you decide to take a nap somewhere;- if you are afraid of dogs you should avoid this park because a lot of people come to walk their dogs;- you can see Corona Heights park to the west!
I love hiking up here or going here for a walk. I personally think this is THE BEST view of SF. There's a lot of nearby hills/heights/peaks, but I think this one takes the cake. You get a very wide/panoramic view of the city and a great view of downtown and the bay too. With other peaks/hills, there's usually something in the way. Or sometimes, the hill itself is already too near the center of the city, so you miss out of views of the entire city. With Bernal Hill, you can see downtown really well and all the neighborhoods leading up to it (mission, soma, dog patch, etc). I don't know how many other ways I can say this, but it's just THE BEST VIEW.Other things to note: This is a dog park, so many people come and bring ALL their dogs. So if you love corgis, goldens, pugs, or any other kind of dog, you'll love this place.There's a water fountain near the south entrance of the park. If you're thirsty, or if you have a friend who happens to have her contact fall out of here eye and you need to wash it out so she isn't blind in one eye.If you want to actually walk up to the top/summit, there are actual walking trails that aren't super steep that lead you up there. So you don't have to take the makeshift/super steep trails, unless you want to.To get to the actual hill can sometimes be tricky, as the roads wind around. But google maps usually helps me. If you're walking, I'd just put it into google maps. If you're driving, I'd just park wherever you feel comfortable (since most spots are parallel parking on a steep incline) and there's no actual parking lot.People are super friendly here and in my experience more than happy to take pictures of you/for you/of themselves.Also, it can be windy up here near sunset, so wear extra layers!
Great views in the day, evening or night. There are many access points up. You can follow the main path up or other smaller man made paths that have been created (shortcuts or secret spots). Parking is easy around the entire area.
San Francisco, CA:  W-O-W.Amazing.Breathtaking.Arrived by the #24 Cortland bus from Divisadero at McAllister. The Muni 311 helpline suggested I get off at Cortland /Bocana but a kindly gentleman residing in the neighborhood was about to get off at the following bus stop and suggested I follow him off. He pointed to Andover, said to take the stairs up to the top, and I will be at Bernal Heights Park. Sounded simple enough and away I went. Ten minutes later, after zig-zagging my way up alongside many pretty residential gardens, I literally arrived at Bernal Heights Park. The sign told me so.The time was nearing 5:00pm, on a Sunday. There was a drinking fountain nearby and a sign with the name of the park inscribed on it. Wildflowers were blooming on the hill. Lots of poochies and their humans were coming and going. It looked like I still needed to climb up an incline for views so I went up to as close to the top as I legally could. There, I found jaw dropping views of San Francisco! Photos do not quite do the scenery justice. See yelp buddy Edwin R's review for a local's perspective of this "magical place." I was very moved and felt I wasn't ready to head home yet, despite the fact that I would  be leaving the next morning. Despite the many number of two and four legged creatures, the shade of the trees, the gentle breeze, the peacefulness, the beautiful sight of San Francisco below,  made me want to keep lingering. A place of rejuvenation in the middle of a great city.But, evening called, and I still had to get down to Mission Street to catch the Muni (bus). Almost a tear and no happy smiles as I slowly found my way down the north side of Bernal Hill.
I absolutely love green spaces. As humans, it's in our nature to be drawn to the beauty of nature. Bernal Park isn't as big as some urban parks I've been accustomed to in Los Angeles but it perfect for San Francisco. From the top you'll get a 360 degree of this world renowned city. The views are spectacular especially on a clear night. It's my go to place to seek serenity and clarity of my mind. The park is frequent by many locals but isn't crowded even during peak hours. Its a great place for a picnic for couples or just to clear your head and enjoy the beauty of this dense city. Parking isn't bad at all and there aren't any steep inclines so its a great place for beginners although its about the size of Will Smith's estate (big but not huge). Check it out and remember to avoid littering. I'm watching you!!! Oh yes, dogs are welcomed!!!!!
Short hike, amazing view!You can see all of SF in a 360 angle, yes 360! You can see the city, bay bridge, golden gate bridge, and all the housing! I would definitely recommend Bernal Heights Park for a view of the entire San Francisco area! THERE IS A SWING AT THE TOP. Good spot to take photos while chillin on the swing!
I don't know how a place like this only has some 48 reviews right now. I almost don't wanna write a review so I can keep it my little secret BUT this kind of beauty needs to be shared! If I ever needed to be reminded of how beautiful SF is, I'll always come here, Twin Peaks, or Battery Spencer. This location is fairly easy to navigate to, with pretty easy parking. I can't speak on the other side because I always enter on the same side, but to my knowledge, the parking is just street (read: parallel) parking. I've come here early in the morning and also at night, and I've never had issues finding parking. There's a brief walk to get to the top from the parking area. It's really up to you whether or not to go all the way to the top, but after walking ~5 minutes you're more or less surrounded by a 360 view of SF already. There's a single bench if you wanna sit, but I've found crossing over the barrier and sitting on the rocks on the hill work just as well. On a more recent visit, I was surprised to see that there's a swing at the top now! Fair warning, the swing is kiiiiinda high so if you're on the smaller side (5'3" and below), you might have some trouble getting up on the swing. Not that I tried to get on, fell off, and bled..or anything....but seriously, be careful please lol. Also, not sure if it's seasonal but when I went there were a ton of mosquitoes, so to all my fellow sweet blood homies: PROTECT YA NECK...and arms, and legs too! Just be liberal with that bug spray and I think you'll be okay.  Overall, it's a pretty solid place to take your dog, get your cardio on, catch the sunrise, or to just take in the beautiful view of SF when Karl the Fog isn't around. Or you know, to get a picture that'll get you a good amount of likes on your Instagram, haha.
Wow, this park was a wonderful surprise. What a view!I Love the view of the pink mural on the  modern home at the base of the park as well
Beautiful 360 views of the city!! It's not really a hike, but you do have to walk up dirt paths to get to the top. You could walk circular routes or repeat routes to make it a hike if you wanted to. Dogs are free to roam around which is nice.Basically, beautiful city views definitely worth a trip up to sit, relax, and enjoy.Tip: Bring a jacket as it can get windy.
Go when it is not foggy!! I was in the area checking out Dynamo Donuts and had to burn some energy to get hungry for dinner (first world problems, I know). Found this place on yelp and decided to explore. Paved path to the top is easy, not bad at all. While walking up the paved path, you'll see dirt trails of people ditching the trail and climbing straight to the top. I tried this and wow. Def wore the wrong shoes and def glad I didn't slip on the rocks and break my two front teeth. View at the top could probably be a nice view of the whole city but it was foggy so I couldn't see much. There were lots of people there with dogs, babies in strollers, bikes, and picnics. I didn't see any official picnic areas; it was an actual picnic with a blanket on the ground. There is parking as well if you don't want to walk up the trail. Somewhere near the parking is a labyrinth rock thing. It's a small but still really cool. I'd go here again just to walk around, relax, and maybe picnic on a blanket.
Beautiful, calm park. Open layout. Good views of the city. Nice place to walk around. Near Bernal street slides, as well. Not over ridden with crowds of tourists. Come here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
I have been here several times with my best friend Joe who lives in the neighborhood and who is also a dog owner named "Bantay" (Guard Dog in Filipino) and I keep forgetting to check in!Anyhow, this park is suitable for dogs who enjoys the outdoor and enjoy plenty of walking and running around especially without a leash.  Fortunately for me, my dog "Jackson Louie" is super active -- and hiking and running is one of his weekly regimen on the list amongst other things (we will not mention food).This park has a great view over looking San Francisco.  On a clear day - you will have a clear view of Twin Peaks just to  your left, and in the middle is Market Street -- and to your right - the San Francisco Bay Bridge.  We even got great shots of ships cruising the bay in view of Potrero Hill (Dog Patch District).But that's just one of the perks of this park. I think the best part is their hiking trails.  There are plenty of hideaway where you can escape and explore with your four legged friend as well as with your friends and family.  When you get to the very top of the mountain peak - it is absolutely magical.  There are plenty of trees so do plan on bringing your favorite book or  "Kindle" and read, relax, and enjoy the moment of nature.  Best of all, your dog will enjoy mingling with the local dogs as well as the visiting ones!  Most of the owners here are very nice and their dogs too are well behaved.  It is a great place for your dog to explore off leash and not have to worry about the hustle and bustle of busy on coming traffic especially cars. It does get busy here during the week especially between 3-6PM where people go running and jogging.  So stay off the paved road during that time and enjoy the rocky terrain.I highly recommend visiting this place especially if you live in San Francisco.  What a treat indeed!  Your dog will thank you!Cheers!
Love this one! We found out about this place recently after living in the neighborhood for few years.You cab see the whole view of the city:) Definitely taking my family and friends when they visit next time.
Another awesome view of the city. We walked up at night to see the city lights and they did not disappoint.
Great views of the city:) Very peaceful, lots of dogs too but not crowded (in the morning at least).
The view from Bernal Heights is incredible. There are not many places east of Twin Peaks where you can see as far north as the Golden Gate bridge and as far south as San Bruno mountain. Plus, the surrounding neighborhood is adorable. Take a picnic, enjoy the view, and try not to get stuck on a steep slope!
I was first introduced to Bernal Heights Park a few years ago by a friend.  My friend lives down the street from this top of the hill park.  It's a short hike up there and we usually bring the dogs with us.  It's a popular park where dogs can go off leash.  The views are pretty amazing once you get up to the top.  On a non foggy day, you can see the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, San Bruno Mountain, and the hills of the East Bay.  It's a great neighborhood park but also could be a tourist attraction for those who like to stray from the beaten path.  It does get quite windy up there though, so don't forget your jacket!
This is a hidden gem hike near the end of the mission.  Its very short (15-20 minutes walking from Mission St.) and its easily done by anyone.  While steep and step-filled, it's totally worth the magnificent view of SF, downtown, and the bay bridge.  If it's a sunny day, it's a perfect hike for a nice glimpse of the city while not having to go too far.Must do for the SF bucklist!

Despite the many number of two and four legged creatures, the shade of the trees, the gentle breeze, the peacefulness, the beautiful sight of San Francisco below,  made me want to keep lingering. A place of rejuvenation in the middle of a great city.But, evening called, and I still had to get down to Mission Street to catch the Muni (bus). Almost a tear and no happy smiles as I slowly found my way down the north side of Bernal Hill.
I absolutely love green spaces. As humans, it's in our nature to be drawn to the beauty of nature. Bernal Park isn't as big as some urban parks I've been accustomed to in Los Angeles but it perfect for San Francisco. From the top you'll get a 360 degree of this world renowned city. The views are spectacular especially on a clear night. It's my go to place to seek serenity and clarity of my mind. The park is frequent by many locals but isn't crowded even during peak hours. Its a great place for a picnic for couples or just to clear your head and enjoy the beauty of this dense city. Parking isn't bad at all and there aren't any steep inclines so its a great place for beginners although its about the size of Will Smith's estate (big but not huge). Check it out and remember to avoid littering. I'm watching you!!! Oh yes, dogs are welcomed!!!!!
Short hike, amazing view!You can see all of SF in a 360 angle, yes 360! You can see the city, bay bridge, golden gate bridge, and all the housing! I would definitely recommend Bernal Heights Park for a view of the entire San Francisco area! THERE IS A SWING AT THE TOP. Good spot to take photos while chillin on the swing!
I don't know how a place like this only has some 48 reviews right now. I almost don't wanna write a review so I can keep it my little secret BUT this kind of beauty needs to be shared! If I ever needed to be reminded of how beautiful SF is, I'll always come here, Twin Peaks, or Battery Spencer. This location is fairly easy to navigate to, with pretty easy parking. I can't speak on the other side because I always enter on the same side, but to my knowledge, the parking is just street (read: parallel) parking. I've come here early in the morning and also at night, and I've never had issues finding parking. There's a brief walk to get to the top from the parking area. It's really up to you whether or not to go all the way to the top, but after walking ~5 minutes you're more or less surrounded by a 360 view of SF already. There's a single bench if you wanna sit, but I've found crossing over the barrier and sitting on the rocks on the hill work just as well. On a more recent visit, I was surprised to see that there's a swing at the top now! Fair warning, the swing is kiiiiinda high so if you're on the smaller side (5'3" and below), you might have some trouble getting up on the swing. Not that I tried to get on, fell off, and bled..or anything....but seriously, be careful please lol. Also, not sure if it's seasonal but when I went there were a ton of mosquitoes, so to all my fellow sweet blood homies: PROTECT YA NECK...and arms, and legs too! Just be liberal with that bug spray and I think you'll be okay.  Overall, it's a pretty solid place to take your dog, get your cardio on, catch the sunrise, or to just take in the beautiful view of SF when Karl the Fog isn't around. Or you know, to get a picture that'll get you a good amount of likes on your Instagram, haha.
Wow, this park was a wonderful surprise. What a view!I Love the view of the pink mural on the  modern home at the base of the park as well
Beautiful 360 views of the city!! It's not really a hike, but you do have to walk up dirt paths to get to the top. You could walk circular routes or repeat routes to make it a hike if you wanted to. Dogs are free to roam around which is nice.Basically, beautiful city views definitely worth a trip up to sit, relax, and enjoy.Tip: Bring a jacket as it can get windy.
Go when it is not foggy!! I was in the area checking out Dynamo Donuts and had to burn some energy to get hungry for dinner (first world problems, I know). Found this place on yelp and decided to explore. Paved path to the top is easy, not bad at all. While walking up the paved path, you'll see dirt trails of people ditching the trail and climbing straight to the top. I tried this and wow. Def wore the wrong shoes and def glad I didn't slip on the rocks and break my two front teeth. View at the top could probably be a nice view of the whole city but it was foggy so I couldn't see much. There were lots of people there with dogs, babies in strollers, bikes, and picnics. I didn't see any official picnic areas; it was an actual picnic with a blanket on the ground. There is parking as well if you don't want to walk up the trail. Somewhere near the parking is a labyrinth rock thing. It's a small but still really cool. I'd go here again just to walk around, relax, and maybe picnic on a blanket.
Beautiful, calm park. Open layout. Good views of the city. Nice place to walk around. Near Bernal street slides, as well. Not over ridden with crowds of tourists. Come here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
I have been here several times with my best friend Joe who lives in the neighborhood and who is also a dog owner named "Bantay" (Guard Dog in Filipino) and I keep forgetting to check in!Anyhow, this park is suitable for dogs who enjoys the outdoor and enjoy plenty of walking and running around especially without a leash.  Fortunately for me, my dog "Jackson Louie" is super active -- and hiking and running is one of his weekly regimen on the list amongst other things (we will not mention food).This park has a great view over looking San Francisco.  On a clear day - you will have a clear view of Twin Peaks just to  your left, and in the middle is Market Street -- and to your right - the San Francisco Bay Bridge.  We even got great shots of ships cruising the bay in view of Potrero Hill (Dog Patch District).But that's just one of the perks of this park. I think the best part is their hiking trails.  There are plenty of hideaway where you can escape and explore with your four legged friend as well as with your friends and family.  When you get to the very top of the mountain peak - it is absolutely magical.  There are plenty of trees so do plan on bringing your favorite book or  "Kindle" and read, relax, and enjoy the moment of nature.  Best of all, your dog will enjoy mingling with the local dogs as well as the visiting ones!  Most of the owners here are very nice and their dogs too are well behaved.  It is a great place for your dog to explore off leash and not have to worry about the hustle and bustle of busy on coming traffic especially cars. It does get busy here during the week especially between 3-6PM where people go running and jogging.  So stay off the paved road during that time and enjoy the rocky terrain.I highly recommend visiting this place especially if you live in San Francisco.  What a treat indeed!  Your dog will thank you!Cheers!
Love this one! We found out about this place recently after living in the neighborhood for few years.You cab see the whole view of the city:) Definitely taking my family and friends when they visit next time.
Another awesome view of the city. We walked up at night to see the city lights and they did not disappoint.
Great views of the city:) Very peaceful, lots of dogs too but not crowded (in the morning at least).
The view from Bernal Heights is incredible. There are not many places east of Twin Peaks where you can see as far north as the Golden Gate bridge and as far south as San Bruno mountain. Plus, the surrounding neighborhood is adorable. Take a picnic, enjoy the view, and try not to get stuck on a steep slope!
I was first introduced to Bernal Heights Park a few years ago by a friend.  My friend lives down the street from this top of the hill park.  It's a short hike up there and we usually bring the dogs with us.  It's a popular park where dogs can go off leash.  The views are pretty amazing once you get up to the top.  On a non foggy day, you can see the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, downtown, San Bruno Mountain, and the hills of the East Bay.  It's a great neighborhood park but also could be a tourist attraction for those who like to stray from the beaten path.  It does get quite windy up there though, so don't forget your jacket!
This is a hidden gem hike near the end of the mission.  Its very short (15-20 minutes walking from Mission St.) and its easily done by anyone.  While steep and step-filled, it's totally worth the magnificent view of SF, downtown, and the bay bridge.  If it's a sunny day, it's a perfect hike for a nice glimpse of the city while not having to go too far.Must do for the SF bucklist!
Great views of San Francisco! First time here, you get a 360 panoramic view compared to Lands End and such. Will bring my friend and the dogs to enjoy this open space. Not too crowded either. I was ably to find my neighborhood easily.
I am not sure why it took me so long to finally visit this park with my dogs. Truly it is a people and dog friendly place, where both can enjoy a stroll any time of the day. With 360 degree views of San Francisco, you'll want to mark this place as a spot to bring your out-of-town guests! I can only imagine what the views look like at night, with The City a-glow. The hike, which I would't really call a full on hike, is perhaps a 20-30 minute walk to the top. That is depending on your speed and whether your dog races to the top of course. The area is lush with Wildflowers, tall grass and California's State flower, the Poppy. Parking was extremely easy. I practically pulled into a spot at the park entrance at peak 12:30pm on a Sunday. Put on your walking shoes and go check it out!
Lovely view of SF from the southeast! Tips for visiting: - visit during the daytime (preferably on a sunny day) because you will be able to see really really far;- you can park at the base of the park and hike up (~10 min walk) or drive up to find street parking;- look for a paved road that leads to the top of the park (there is also a rocky road a bit further down the street, which is steeper and harder to walk on, but it will lead to the same place as the paved road);- there is tree at the top of the park and it has a rope with a handle bar tied to it. It's sturdy and you can swing on it;- the grass looks really green and soft but dogs pee and poop on it so be very careful where you want to lie down if you decide to take a nap somewhere;- if you are afraid of dogs you should avoid this park because a lot of people come to walk their dogs;- you can see Corona Heights park to the west!
I love hiking up here or going here for a walk. I personally think this is THE BEST view of SF. There's a lot of nearby hills/heights/peaks, but I think this one takes the cake. You get a very wide/panoramic view of the city and a great view of downtown and the bay too. With other peaks/hills, there's usually something in the way. Or sometimes, the hill itself is already too near the center of the city, so you miss out of views of the entire city. With Bernal Hill, you can see downtown really well and all the neighborhoods leading up to it (mission, soma, dog patch, etc). I don't know how many other ways I can say this, but it's just THE BEST VIEW.Other things to note: This is a dog park, so many people come and bring ALL their dogs. So if you love corgis, goldens, pugs, or any other kind of dog, you'll love this place.There's a water fountain near the south entrance of the park. If you're thirsty, or if you have a friend who happens to have her contact fall out of here eye and you need to wash it out so she isn't blind in one eye.If you want to actually walk up to the top/summit, there are actual walking trails that aren't super steep that lead you up there. So you don't have to take the makeshift/super steep trails, unless you want to.To get to the actual hill can sometimes be tricky, as the roads wind around. But google maps usually helps me. If you're walking, I'd just put it into google maps. If you're driving, I'd just park wherever you feel comfortable (since most spots are parallel parking on a steep incline) and there's no actual parking lot.People are super friendly here and in my experience more than happy to take pictures of you/for you/of themselves.Also, it can be windy up here near sunset, so wear extra layers!
Great views in the day, evening or night. There are many access points up. You can follow the main path up or other smaller man made paths that have been created (shortcuts or secret spots). Parking is easy around the entire area.
San Francisco, CA:  W-O-W.Amazing.Breathtaking.Arrived by the #24 Cortland bus from Divisadero at McAllister. The Muni 311 helpline suggested I get off at Cortland /Bocana but a kindly gentleman residing in the neighborhood was about to get off at the following bus stop and suggested I follow him off. He pointed to Andover, said to take the stairs up to the top, and I will be at Bernal Heights Park. Sounded simple enough and away I went. Ten minutes later, after zig-zagging my way up alongside many pretty residential gardens, I literally arrived at Bernal Heights Park. The sign told me so.The time was nearing 5:00pm, on a Sunday. There was a drinking fountain nearby and a sign with the name of the park inscribed on it. Wildflowers were blooming on the hill. Lots of poochies and their humans were coming and going. It looked like I still needed to climb up an incline for views so I went up to as close to the top as I legally could. There, I found jaw dropping views of San Francisco! Photos do not quite do the scenery justice. See yelp buddy Edwin R's review for a local's perspective of this "magical place." I was very moved and felt I wasn't ready to head home yet, despite the fact that I would  be leaving the next morning.
