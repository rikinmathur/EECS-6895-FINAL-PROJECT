A little background - the museum is located on the third floor of the Russian culture center, which includes other Russian community services like a library and preschool.  You have to buzz an intercom to get inside (just say you're there to visit).It has weird hours because it's staffed by volunteers.  That's a good thing though, because someone will inevitably act as your informal tour guide!  I was met by Felix who, recognizing I wasn't Russian, gave me an energetic tour of the museum's highlights.  Apparently, just about every modern technology can be traced back to a Russian inventor.It's a fairly small space (think of a big living room), but packed floor to ceiling with books, photos, paintings, memorabilia, newspaper clippings, coins, models, flags, and sculptures of Russian history spanning the last several centuries.  Of course, there's a focus on the history of Russian Californians, which is a group I didn't even know existed.  Fascinating stuff in every corner.You won't spend hours here, but you will walk away with a warm impression of the Russian community here in SF.  This is not a sterilized museum, but the sincere product of some very committed and proud individuals.  Culture! Real culture!
