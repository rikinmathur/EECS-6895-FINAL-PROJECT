My little brother wanted to visit here while we were in town so we went on a Sunday night when it was relatively empty. My family took about an hour/hour and a half to walk through the entire museum.  It had a lot of different, interesting items with a lot of interactive exhibits as well. It was a little pricey but the employee checking out us out was nice enough to honor a 20% coupon I found online. Even with the 20% coupon it was still pricey, but nonetheless fun.
Come and experience the strangest, odd and unbelievable place in the Pier 39! Ripleys Believe it or Not is a MUST come when in the Pier 39 area of San Francisco and if you have young children. I came here as I had a SF GoPass and this was an option to explore.Ripley's Believe It Or Not is a franchise that was founded by Robert Ripley and deals with bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that some people may question the claims.I have to admit this place does have the weirdest, funniest and amusing things in here. The most fun was the mirror maze and laser beam challenge at the end and the glass "Disco Hall" complete with music which you can bypass if you can't bring yourself to step on it to walk across.SOME ATTRACTIONS:There are the usual exhibits like the Vampire Woman, Robert Wadlow,and the Lizard Man but I saw a few that I had never seen before and that was great! TICKET PRICES:Just to see Ripleys is: $18.99Mirror Maze: $9.99They also have the combo tickets that let you bundle multiple attractions at a reduced rate. Combine: Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditorium, the Marvelous Mirror Maze, LaseRace, Aquarium of the Bay, or City Sightseeing Tours but that comes in many different prices depending on what you really want to see. TOUR:The tour takes about 45 mins to an hour. For me, it took about an hour because I was SO  amazed at the exhibits and went back a couple times to my favorite ones. HOURS:The Odditorium is opened 365 days a year!! Yayy! Sunday - Thursday: 10am - 10pmFriday - Saturday: 10am - 11pmThis place is perfect for adults and children! You will truly be in awe and ohhs when you come here! So many cool and weirdest things that will definitely have you thinking.
A very interesting museum in SF. I have heard of this place a lot  and finally decided to visit it with my friends. The mirror maze was my favorite.They are some very interesting displays like donkey made from wine corks, Golden gate bridge made from tooth picks and so on.They also had a lot of interactive things to do like unlocking a mystery gate, laser shooting, etc.Take time to read all the placards. It is definitely worth it.
Boring. Almost everything was just a replica of something else. Not a Groupon, so only paid $12 a person, but that still to much. Don't waste your time.
This was a very fun place! There was so many artifacts to learn. Not knowing if it was real or not, we found everything interesting and fun to see. This place is 2 floors of fun and learning. Having a laser room and a maze of mirrors which we couldn't get out of. I would do this again just to do the maze of mirrors, that was south fun! Rhis was a perfect place to take pictures of random oddities!
Cool place for kids and adults. It had sum interesting facts. They need to lower the entrance price. We had a GO card otherwise i would not have paid to go in here.
Ripley's has to be the weirdest, quirkiest and most fun museums that I have been to. I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed myself, tapping into my inner child and learning new things along the way. While I find myself getting extremely squeamish whenever I try to watch the TV show, in the museum I am wide eyed, interested and intrigued!Ripley's Believe It Or Not! has over 400 out of this world exhibits and artifacts encompassing 2 floors, they have 3 different attractions all under one roof. There is the Odditorium which is the main portion of the museum and it houses various exhibits like the Shrunken Head, Transformers made of recycled car parts and Wire Sculptures just to name a few. The second attraction is something that everyone should be familiar with and that's the Marvelous Mirror Maze, you can definitely find yourself trapped in and here and running into mirrors while trying to find your way out. Then last but not least the Impossible Laser Race which has you trying to get through the lasers effectively as fast as you can, kinda like the movie Mission Impossible.This museum can be enjoyed by both adults and kids, I believe that everyone would love this place. I've come with friends, family and an ex bf and found that every visit we had a ball in this place, I mean so much fun, lots of laughs, lots of interesting things to learn and just being silly. You will see some really unique and cool things here, some that are amazing, some that are jaw dropping and some that will make you squirm a little bit.It's not too pricey considering you can go to all 3 attractions for less than $30 and sometimes Groupon or Living Social has deals as well. The museum does offer a few deals of its own, they have an aquarium combo which includes the Odditorium, Aquarium Of The Bay, Mirror Maze and Laser Race for $43.99 (Adults) and $26.99 (Children) as well as a City Sightseeing Combo which includes the Odditorium, City Sightseeing Tour, Mirror Maze and Laser Race for $52.99 (Adults) and $33.99 (Children).
This is an interesting place to kill some time, which I decided to do on a whim before having to head back to the airport on my last day from visiting SF for a few days.  Years ago, I went to another location in Hollywood, CA.  They need to update their exhibits because many of these, you can view if you watch the National Geographic or Discovery channels on TV...or you saw the same exhibits when you visited over a decade or two ago.  I'm sure there's new stories out there way by now to show.While a full refund isn't necessary (as I've said for certain other places), I wish I had had a discount for this place.  If you're trying to decide whether to go here or to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, this is a little more interesting.
Exhibits were pretty cool. There was A LOT of reading involved, though, so maybe not the best for small children. It has a lot of funky art and some videos. There was definitely a lot to look at but there was also a lot of reused material throughout it, too.
Fun venue to visit with kids. You can take the silliest pictures with the wax figures and spend hours goofing around. Since the wax figures look realistic, younger kids may be frightened around the Jurassic Park and Hitchcock's Birds exhibits. Keep an eye out for the SF mags stocked in the hotels or around the wharf for coupons to this venue. I'm not sure if it was a special, but we also got a free entry to the SF Dungeon Museum.
I'm giving this museum 4 stars. Although I thought the ticket prices were a little high we did get to see quite a few interesting things. They have some interactive displays/attractions which was cool but most everything else you just read a small paragraph about what your looking at. Overall it was pretty fascinating and I'm glad I went :)
I first got greeted very nicely , then I ended up on a bed of nails which was meh okay not too much of a frill.There was something else I couldn't quite figure out what the deal was.There were a lot of interesting things as I went higher and higher up.I liked the crazy lighted up areas and the spooky dinosaur.The top floor was my favorite .There was also a laser maze there which was very easy.They had a candy shop with tons of candy and this floor that was really trippy it made you feel like you were gonna fall.The person I was with had tons of fun and enjoyed it.Idk I thought it was okay tho.They have a great astronaut room that tells you tons of facts and is a lil interactive
First let me tell you that my review is coming from my children's response to the place and some stuff from my own point of view.We were greeted by Simon when we walked in there and this guy was not only courteous but very helpful.  I asked a few questions about the place before entering and he responded to everything patiently and accurately.  You see, my 11-year-old has been collecting the books for years and this was like a little dream for him but I still wanted to make sure all of my children would be ok in there since middle son has Autism and could respond to certain things very badly.  I would have liked to go in and check out the Mirror maze but not sure how my middle son would respond and not knowing how easily I could exit the place if I needed to made us all agree that we'd skip that and just look at the stuff on display. Thank you Simon!My kids LOVED it.  They read everything and loved seeing things they had only seen in books.  I even met a man in there that wasn't too impressed with me but I threw myself in his arms anyway.  *see pictureTickets are 10.99 for children 5-12.  18.99 for 13-adults.  This is the price for the museum alone.  I didn't think that was bad at all and considering why I was there... cheap to make a little dream come true.  My 3 children enjoyed it but my 11-year-old was beside himself.So much to see.  They really make good use of their space.  I'm sure the exhibitions change but we liked what they had there when we visited and will definitely visit again.
Born and raised in SF, but since my 9 yr old loves the RBION books, we decided to check this place out as part of our "tourist" day. In short, I would not pay full price for this museum, but with the two for $20 Groupon, it was a good value. My son was able to check out some of the "oddiities" he's seen in the books up close and personal like the "lizard" man. We spent about 45 mins in there. You can also pay about $5 more per person to check out the Mirror Maze and Laser Maze.
I've been to Pier 39 so many times but this is the first time I've been to this museum. I even don't know it a museum until my cousin wanted to come inside to take pic with captain american Lol This museum is bigger than I think and I love it. There are so many things interesting and I have learned a lot, especially about SF
I love these places! We had a fun time checking out all the oddities.I was glad my kids weren't with us though (ages 5 & 7) because I think they are still a little too young. They probably would've enjoyed some parts, but I would have gotten tired reading all of the descriptions out loud to them. I'd say it's best for maybe ages 8 and up. It was nice to have a date night and be able to go at our own pace. It was my boyfriend's first time at a Ripley's museum and I wasn't sure if he'd like it, but he had a good time too. We had a coupon from one of those tourist magazines so we saved a few bucks (always nice!).
blahhh... my son enjoyed it and that's what counts... You definitely should lower your price. Not worth it..
The only thing I didn't believe was that they charge money to see things that are easily found for free online.  The displays were very cheap, dirty (old), and thrown together.  There are interactive displays, but many of them you have to pay for, which is just insult to injury, and the standing-by change machine just hammered the point home that I was going to be nickle-and-dimed the whole way through.I can imagine that maybe for kids it's fun, but otherwise it was a huge waste of money.
Definitely see this if you are in SF. It's a classic tourist trap, but there aren't too many of those around anymore, so if you haven't been here, I would say check it out. Some of the attractions are kind of creepy, like various two-headed animals (all taxidermy, not live) and wax replicas of human oddities. Then there are more straightforward museum things, like artworks and historical artifacts. There are also a few interactive things, like a shooting gallery.I'm taking off one star, because it feels a little bit exploitative at times. Like, it's interesting to see strange tribal practices, but there is no cultural context, and neither are there examples of equally strange practices that have happened in "civilized" societies. That would actually get people to think seriously about the strangeness of humanity in general, which I think is what Robert Ripley wanted. Anyway, this is old-fashioned fun, and worth it just to see the closest thing we have today to a circus sideshow. Also, I wish I had gone as a kid just because everything is a little more amazing and memorable when you're little.
When I was younger, I loved Ripley's. I can't remember going, only that I liked it.In my early 20s, I visited again with a few friends. We had an awesome time. I loved all the records, and the weird, and the unusual, and the grotesque. We had a great time.I was expecting a similar amount of enjoyable weirdness with my husband - he hadn't been since he was a child, himself. It was a great deal as a three-pack tourist bundle (aquarium, + toussads + ripley's for $50 is great). It was enjoyable, in a way, but not as much as fun as I remembered.The exhibits leaned toward unique and historical, more than actually unbelievable. I felt almost all the edge the odditorium had had been leached out. Maybe it was inevitable, with the internet age showing us so many oddities regularly, but it was just a bit of a let-down.I would still say it's worth an hour to explore if you don't set your expectations high.

I'm giving this museum 4 stars. Although I thought the ticket prices were a little high we did get to see quite a few interesting things. They have some interactive displays/attractions which was cool but most everything else you just read a small paragraph about what your looking at. Overall it was pretty fascinating and I'm glad I went :)
I first got greeted very nicely , then I ended up on a bed of nails which was meh okay not too much of a frill.There was something else I couldn't quite figure out what the deal was.There were a lot of interesting things as I went higher and higher up.I liked the crazy lighted up areas and the spooky dinosaur.The top floor was my favorite .There was also a laser maze there which was very easy.They had a candy shop with tons of candy and this floor that was really trippy it made you feel like you were gonna fall.The person I was with had tons of fun and enjoyed it.Idk I thought it was okay tho.They have a great astronaut room that tells you tons of facts and is a lil interactive
First let me tell you that my review is coming from my children's response to the place and some stuff from my own point of view.We were greeted by Simon when we walked in there and this guy was not only courteous but very helpful.  I asked a few questions about the place before entering and he responded to everything patiently and accurately.  You see, my 11-year-old has been collecting the books for years and this was like a little dream for him but I still wanted to make sure all of my children would be ok in there since middle son has Autism and could respond to certain things very badly.  I would have liked to go in and check out the Mirror maze but not sure how my middle son would respond and not knowing how easily I could exit the place if I needed to made us all agree that we'd skip that and just look at the stuff on display. Thank you Simon!My kids LOVED it.  They read everything and loved seeing things they had only seen in books.  I even met a man in there that wasn't too impressed with me but I threw myself in his arms anyway.  *see pictureTickets are 10.99 for children 5-12.  18.99 for 13-adults.  This is the price for the museum alone.  I didn't think that was bad at all and considering why I was there... cheap to make a little dream come true.  My 3 children enjoyed it but my 11-year-old was beside himself.So much to see.  They really make good use of their space.  I'm sure the exhibitions change but we liked what they had there when we visited and will definitely visit again.
Born and raised in SF, but since my 9 yr old loves the RBION books, we decided to check this place out as part of our "tourist" day. In short, I would not pay full price for this museum, but with the two for $20 Groupon, it was a good value. My son was able to check out some of the "oddiities" he's seen in the books up close and personal like the "lizard" man. We spent about 45 mins in there. You can also pay about $5 more per person to check out the Mirror Maze and Laser Maze.
I've been to Pier 39 so many times but this is the first time I've been to this museum. I even don't know it a museum until my cousin wanted to come inside to take pic with captain american Lol This museum is bigger than I think and I love it. There are so many things interesting and I have learned a lot, especially about SF
I love these places! We had a fun time checking out all the oddities.I was glad my kids weren't with us though (ages 5 & 7) because I think they are still a little too young. They probably would've enjoyed some parts, but I would have gotten tired reading all of the descriptions out loud to them. I'd say it's best for maybe ages 8 and up. It was nice to have a date night and be able to go at our own pace. It was my boyfriend's first time at a Ripley's museum and I wasn't sure if he'd like it, but he had a good time too. We had a coupon from one of those tourist magazines so we saved a few bucks (always nice!).
blahhh... my son enjoyed it and that's what counts... You definitely should lower your price. Not worth it..
The only thing I didn't believe was that they charge money to see things that are easily found for free online.  The displays were very cheap, dirty (old), and thrown together.  There are interactive displays, but many of them you have to pay for, which is just insult to injury, and the standing-by change machine just hammered the point home that I was going to be nickle-and-dimed the whole way through.I can imagine that maybe for kids it's fun, but otherwise it was a huge waste of money.
Definitely see this if you are in SF. It's a classic tourist trap, but there aren't too many of those around anymore, so if you haven't been here, I would say check it out. Some of the attractions are kind of creepy, like various two-headed animals (all taxidermy, not live) and wax replicas of human oddities. Then there are more straightforward museum things, like artworks and historical artifacts. There are also a few interactive things, like a shooting gallery.I'm taking off one star, because it feels a little bit exploitative at times. Like, it's interesting to see strange tribal practices, but there is no cultural context, and neither are there examples of equally strange practices that have happened in "civilized" societies. That would actually get people to think seriously about the strangeness of humanity in general, which I think is what Robert Ripley wanted. Anyway, this is old-fashioned fun, and worth it just to see the closest thing we have today to a circus sideshow. Also, I wish I had gone as a kid just because everything is a little more amazing and memorable when you're little.
When I was younger, I loved Ripley's. I can't remember going, only that I liked it.In my early 20s, I visited again with a few friends. We had an awesome time. I loved all the records, and the weird, and the unusual, and the grotesque. We had a great time.I was expecting a similar amount of enjoyable weirdness with my husband - he hadn't been since he was a child, himself. It was a great deal as a three-pack tourist bundle (aquarium, + toussads + ripley's for $50 is great). It was enjoyable, in a way, but not as much as fun as I remembered.The exhibits leaned toward unique and historical, more than actually unbelievable. I felt almost all the edge the odditorium had had been leached out. Maybe it was inevitable, with the internet age showing us so many oddities regularly, but it was just a bit of a let-down.I would still say it's worth an hour to explore if you don't set your expectations high.
My little brother wanted to visit here while we were in town so we went on a Sunday night when it was relatively empty. My family took about an hour/hour and a half to walk through the entire museum.  It had a lot of different, interesting items with a lot of interactive exhibits as well. It was a little pricey but the employee checking out us out was nice enough to honor a 20% coupon I found online. Even with the 20% coupon it was still pricey, but nonetheless fun.
Come and experience the strangest, odd and unbelievable place in the Pier 39! Ripleys Believe it or Not is a MUST come when in the Pier 39 area of San Francisco and if you have young children. I came here as I had a SF GoPass and this was an option to explore.Ripley's Believe It Or Not is a franchise that was founded by Robert Ripley and deals with bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that some people may question the claims.I have to admit this place does have the weirdest, funniest and amusing things in here. The most fun was the mirror maze and laser beam challenge at the end and the glass "Disco Hall" complete with music which you can bypass if you can't bring yourself to step on it to walk across.SOME ATTRACTIONS:There are the usual exhibits like the Vampire Woman, Robert Wadlow,and the Lizard Man but I saw a few that I had never seen before and that was great! TICKET PRICES:Just to see Ripleys is: $18.99Mirror Maze: $9.99They also have the combo tickets that let you bundle multiple attractions at a reduced rate. Combine: Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditorium, the Marvelous Mirror Maze, LaseRace, Aquarium of the Bay, or City Sightseeing Tours but that comes in many different prices depending on what you really want to see. TOUR:The tour takes about 45 mins to an hour. For me, it took about an hour because I was SO  amazed at the exhibits and went back a couple times to my favorite ones. HOURS:The Odditorium is opened 365 days a year!! Yayy! Sunday - Thursday: 10am - 10pmFriday - Saturday: 10am - 11pmThis place is perfect for adults and children! You will truly be in awe and ohhs when you come here! So many cool and weirdest things that will definitely have you thinking.
A very interesting museum in SF. I have heard of this place a lot  and finally decided to visit it with my friends. The mirror maze was my favorite.They are some very interesting displays like donkey made from wine corks, Golden gate bridge made from tooth picks and so on.They also had a lot of interactive things to do like unlocking a mystery gate, laser shooting, etc.Take time to read all the placards. It is definitely worth it.
Boring. Almost everything was just a replica of something else. Not a Groupon, so only paid $12 a person, but that still to much. Don't waste your time.
This was a very fun place! There was so many artifacts to learn. Not knowing if it was real or not, we found everything interesting and fun to see. This place is 2 floors of fun and learning. Having a laser room and a maze of mirrors which we couldn't get out of. I would do this again just to do the maze of mirrors, that was south fun! Rhis was a perfect place to take pictures of random oddities!
Cool place for kids and adults. It had sum interesting facts. They need to lower the entrance price. We had a GO card otherwise i would not have paid to go in here.
Ripley's has to be the weirdest, quirkiest and most fun museums that I have been to. I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed myself, tapping into my inner child and learning new things along the way. While I find myself getting extremely squeamish whenever I try to watch the TV show, in the museum I am wide eyed, interested and intrigued!Ripley's Believe It Or Not! has over 400 out of this world exhibits and artifacts encompassing 2 floors, they have 3 different attractions all under one roof. There is the Odditorium which is the main portion of the museum and it houses various exhibits like the Shrunken Head, Transformers made of recycled car parts and Wire Sculptures just to name a few. The second attraction is something that everyone should be familiar with and that's the Marvelous Mirror Maze, you can definitely find yourself trapped in and here and running into mirrors while trying to find your way out. Then last but not least the Impossible Laser Race which has you trying to get through the lasers effectively as fast as you can, kinda like the movie Mission Impossible.This museum can be enjoyed by both adults and kids, I believe that everyone would love this place. I've come with friends, family and an ex bf and found that every visit we had a ball in this place, I mean so much fun, lots of laughs, lots of interesting things to learn and just being silly. You will see some really unique and cool things here, some that are amazing, some that are jaw dropping and some that will make you squirm a little bit.It's not too pricey considering you can go to all 3 attractions for less than $30 and sometimes Groupon or Living Social has deals as well. The museum does offer a few deals of its own, they have an aquarium combo which includes the Odditorium, Aquarium Of The Bay, Mirror Maze and Laser Race for $43.99 (Adults) and $26.99 (Children) as well as a City Sightseeing Combo which includes the Odditorium, City Sightseeing Tour, Mirror Maze and Laser Race for $52.99 (Adults) and $33.99 (Children).
This is an interesting place to kill some time, which I decided to do on a whim before having to head back to the airport on my last day from visiting SF for a few days.  Years ago, I went to another location in Hollywood, CA.  They need to update their exhibits because many of these, you can view if you watch the National Geographic or Discovery channels on TV...or you saw the same exhibits when you visited over a decade or two ago.  I'm sure there's new stories out there way by now to show.While a full refund isn't necessary (as I've said for certain other places), I wish I had had a discount for this place.  If you're trying to decide whether to go here or to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, this is a little more interesting.
Exhibits were pretty cool. There was A LOT of reading involved, though, so maybe not the best for small children. It has a lot of funky art and some videos. There was definitely a lot to look at but there was also a lot of reused material throughout it, too.
Fun venue to visit with kids. You can take the silliest pictures with the wax figures and spend hours goofing around. Since the wax figures look realistic, younger kids may be frightened around the Jurassic Park and Hitchcock's Birds exhibits. Keep an eye out for the SF mags stocked in the hotels or around the wharf for coupons to this venue. I'm not sure if it was a special, but we also got a free entry to the SF Dungeon Museum.
