This is what an ideal one dollar sign place should be--no frill simple food, but extremely fresh and on point because of the volume.I went there last week to find some fresh seafood. However, I could not find the specialty item I was looking for (however, they seemed to have good collection of typical seafood such as salmon, shrimp, oysters etc). However, as I was already there I decided to order their salmon burger and it was definitely one of the best I have had (even when compared to higher end restaurants).It was a no frill burger with some fresh veggies and an extremely fresh piece of salmon freshly grilled. The best part was that the salmon tasted super fresh and that experience is rare in even mid range restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised and I will go back there more to just get that fresh salmon burger!
Spicy Salmon Poke: 3.5 (+0.5 for the Masago.) Tuna: 2 (Texture was Slightly Tough)Clam Chowder:  2.5 (Lacked Flavor)Caterpillar Roll: 4 (Ironically, I liked this the best.)Volcano Roll: 2 (All I tasted was Rice.)Basa is a basically a hole in the wall fish market with limited table and seats. Prices are reasonable, but the poke wasn't as great as I expected because of all the 4 star ratings. Overall, a 3 star experience.P.S. If you want rice, you have to order it as a side. For people dining in, you pay at the end.
The spicy salmon poke was alright - $6. Wasn't very much fish, but I guess for $6, and in SF, it was a good price. It doesn't come with sushi or regular rice. You can get regular rice for $1 extra. DIdn't think it was worth it for a bunch of rice and very little fish.The fish ceviche was VERY good!! I think this definitely justified $6. It is stored in the fridge in a cup. Didn't come with a tostada chip (only with saltines) whcih is a bummer. But I ate it with the spoon and called it the day.
Been wanting to try this place, can never go wrong with some good poke!Came here around 6PM, wasn't too packed. Pretty small area, you go in and it kind of looks like a fish supermarket. You see all the fishes, poke and everything displayed inside the fridges. You pay first then wait for your food.We ordered:Salmon poke: Pretty good for $6, they had some caviar, I wouldn't say it's the best I had.Oysters: Do not order, wasn't good at ALL. It had no flavor, I felt like I was eating salt water.Fish ceviche: Do not recommend, tasted like water no flavorOverall, I don't think I would come back here again, I would go to Pokeatery in San Mateo instead.
I eely need to clam down because Basa cod not do batter in keeping their food fresh, tasty, and cheap. If you want, you can ask salmon else for their opinion, but I bait they will say the same thing! Okay, had way too much fun writing that intro. But let's get down to business: Basa's food is so cheap for SF Bay Area standards. And more importantly, their fish is fresh! The workers at Basa were friendly, helpful, and very quick. My chowder and poke orders came out almost instantly, and the teriyaki took just 5 minutes. The clam chowder ($2.99 for small bowl) was hot, delicious, with lots of clams. Creamy and heavy as expected, with good original flavor and not overly salty (which I love). The spicy salmon poke ($6) was pretty heavily marinated and creamy, and was topped with roe, black sesame seeds, green onions. By itself it was a bit much, but when I topped it on rice back at home it balanced out to be absolutely delicious. Fresh, too! I didn't get much of a taste of the salmon teriyaki ($9.99) but BF seemed to like it (he finished it in less than 5 minutes). It was a simple plate with a hefty amount of salmon. Can't believe it took me 8 months of living here to stumble upon this place! Love you Basa -- I'll dolphinately be back!
I like going to Basa to purchase the $6 salmon cubes. They say it's about 1/3lb (or $18/lb) compared to a piece of sushi-grade salmon that runs $24.99/lb. I was going to cut it up anyway so the fact that they were already in small cubes only made my life easier.Sometimes parking is a pain but other than that, Basa is a reliable spot for some decently priced fresh fish.
I've ordered delivery from here through Caviar several times and tried a couple of the rolls and nigiri. Prices are cheap for decent, basic sushi. The fish is always fresh but occasionally doesn't seem to be from particularly a great cut and isn't as flavorful or tender as I would like. Rolls and nigiri are well made, a tinyyy bit heavy on the rice but definitely better than anything you'll find at other places of the same price point. The salmon poke is creamy, flavorful, and delicious! But I would suggest adding a bit of rice to go with it since it doesn't come with any.Overall, affordable, everyday sushi. Don't expect uni or o-toro, but this will satisfy your sushi lunch craving on a budget!
Good street style tacos and sushi. Much better than I expected. Stopped in for a quick lunch. Two tacos and two sushi rolls for under $20. We just happened by. If you're in the area and in the mood for good no frills food, this is a good bet.
I dropped by in the middle of the day for lunch and ordered clam chowder and the spicy tuna roll. Service: Staff were friendly. No complaints.Food: As an avid fan of clam chowder, I was quite disappointed. It came to me lukewarm and tasted quite bland. The spicy tuna roll, on the other hand, was pretty good! It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but definitely good enough to fix my sushi cravings. Ambiance: Nothing fancy. Relatively clean. There are a few tables inside for dining in.Price: Affordable! $5.50 for a spicy tuna roll (8 pieces, although a bit on the small side). Overall: I would definitely come back to try more of their menu, but not their clam chowder.
Delicious little hole-in-the-wall sushi place. I recommend getting take-out and picnicking in a local park. The poke was great as was the salmon roll we got, although I imagine everything here is good. Price was a steal for the quality.
Usually in a hurry to catch one of the all-too-rare MUNI 12-Line buses, I never paid much attention to this small 24th Street seafood market out of pure ignorance. I didn't know they had a little cafe set-up in the back until I took a longer look at which point I took a look at the Yelp app and saw a flood of glowing reviews. OK, I should give this a try since there's a lonely formica table with my name on it. Not literally but I put my backpack on one of the empty chairs to secure a space. Perusing the overhead menu, I was struck at the variety of seafood you could order - sandwiches, ceviches, sushi, tacos, oysters, poke, clam chowder (photo: bit.ly/1WqhULY). Could they possibly prepare everything that well?I started with my usual sushi litmus test, a $9.95 Rainbow Roll (photo: bit.ly/20mp83b). It was prepared in a no-frills manner with just tuna and salmon offered on the outside. Inside was more like a California roll since a crab salad and avocado made up the filling. It was quite fresh-tasting, so I had no complaints on their variation on it. The price was certainly right. Speaking of which, I also went for a medium $3.99 cup of the Clam Chowder, which bolted me from Japan to Maine with the first spoonful (photo: bit.ly/1GHrR0z). Thick with a good amount of clams, it wasn't overly creamy which made me happy as I usually find an overuse of cream overwhelms the freshness of a chowder. Not here though as it was quite satisfying.I felt a need to try the $10 half-dozen order of Marin Miyagi Oysters, which were as fresh and briny which I was hoping they would be (photo: bit.ly/1GHrQKg). Presented on a large tray of ice, they were gone quickly since I am an expert slurper. The three squeeze bottles of hot sauces also helped them go down the gullet easily. Because I was not quite sated, I finished my meal off with a couple of $1.99 Fish Tacos (photo: bit.ly/1HmCdxH). Although full of fresh ingredients including what I believe was cod, the tacos were not quite at the level as the other goodies. I think what I learned was to stick with the items where the seafood is the main event. Regardless, the prices are right, and the selection wide-ranging enough to make anyone happy.FOOD - 4 stars...fresh seafood sold by the pound or in a variety of dishes in a no-frills wayAMBIANCE - 3 stars...just a few tables and chairs surrounded by a lot of fishSERVICE - 4 stars...order at the counter and they come serve you pretty quicklyTOTAL - 4 stars...an unusual seaworthy find deep in the Mission well worth seeking out
The poke is so good! It's pretty small but it's only 5$ and worth it! I got the salmon one and it really gives me life frfr! The clam chowder is bomb. The staff is very friendly. The place is kind of like a market and not really restauranty~ but I recommend!
They never fail to impress. I'm in love with their fish and chips, and shrimp and chips. Not a big fan of their combo. The salmon poke was great. I wish I could try their clam chowder but it has bacon in it.
All your basa are belong to me.But really, we ordered about 10% of their menu because it was JUST SO DANG AFFORDABLE. Also, we eat with our eyes. Gobble gobble glare.Between my friend and I, we shared two $6 poke dishes (tuna and spicy salmon), $7.99 fish & chips, $6.50 clam chowder bread bowl, two $2 fish tacos, and a $4.99 side order of seaweed. My favorite was the poke because I love me some raw fish, especially when it's cheap. The fish and chips were hot and crispy, and I liked the fact that their breading is bread crumbs rather than a flour-based coating. The clam chowder and fish tacos did their job in filling the belly. And the seaweed is always greener, in somebody else's lake ;)Go to Basa for poke so that all their basa can belong to you too.
Perfect example of a hole in the wall. Dropped by Basa Seafood Express to get a small fix of fresh fish before ending of day of sight seeing through SF. This spot serves as both a fish market and restaurant towards the back, however with limited seating. We ordered fresh tuna (which they were able to cut into pieces for us to eat), poke and a roll. All items were decently priced and each piece was delish! Service was quick and although the market appeared a little outdated, it was clean.
YUM this place was great!!!! I took le fiance on a surprise date this past weekend, and was looking for some place in the area to eat before we went to Urban Putt Putt. We had literally JUST been talking about how we had been too broke of late to eat sushi and we were both craving it, so when this place popped up I knew we had to go!! So the problem with us is not that we can't afford sushi, persay, it's more like we're both pushing or over 6'0 and thus need to consume a decent amount of food to reach desired fullness levels. And sushi is just not cost effective at most places. But this place was great! The fish was fresh, the menu was intriguing, and we had an amazing meal. Between us we split some spicy salmon poke, a dragon roll, and a plate of fried oysters, fish and shrimp. Service left a little to be desired but eh, what can you do. With that fresh fish at those prices, I'd put up with a lot worse.
Bookmarked Basa after reading Cherylynn's glowing review.  We headed there to pick up scallops and to grab a bite to eat.  I got the soft shell crab sandwich and he got the fish and chips.  Sandwich had lightly fried soft shell crab topped with lettuce, tomato and onion with (homemade?) tartar sauce on the side.  His fish and chips were in a cornmeal coating and lightly fried.  Both were simple but still pleasing and fresh.  The scallops were $18 a pound and they were huge!  I enjoyed them later that night.  Glad to see Basa in the area offering affordable seafood and some cheap lunch eats as well.
Omg, finally tried this place out!!! Poke was so perfect for this sunny day and this place has been bookmarked for months. Glad I finally checked it off my list. Ok, so let's see. Getting here isn't too bad but it's the Mission so prepare for a shortage of parking and lots of traffic coming to this area. Once you're in though, prepare for magic in your mouth. Basa Seafood Express is a gem that I probably wouldn't have known about if it wasn't for my fellow Yelpers. This place could be easy to pass up as it looks like any old seafood market on the street.  But once you go in, you will see a variety of fresh fish, ceviche, poke and cooked foods at the back. When I first entered, the place was fairly bright with lights which made it easy to spot the food. You could just see how fresh the fish was and how clean the place is. I ended up getting the spicy salmon poke which is the best $6 I've ever spent on food and their fish tacos ($2 each). I am a sucker for raw salmon and this poke was absolutely amazing!! I can't tell you how perfectly spicy it was and how fresh the salmon tasted. The fish tacos were average, nothing to rave about here but the poke was too delicious. Portion wasn't too bad for $6 but I wasn't full after one order of it. Seating is minimal, they've got 5 tables max which can probably seat 12 people at most. You also don't pay for your food until the end of your meal and you pay at the front register. Service was good, the owner offered us water and one of the customers kept recommending the salmon burger so I may have to try that next time. Overall, I would come back only for the poke as I didn't try anything else (not counting the fish tacos which you can easily get anywhere). Also, they appear or deliver! Maybe I'll try their delivery service next time since I'm usually really lazy to drive into the city. 5 stars for poke, 5 stars for the price, 5 stars for the service. Only thing I would change about this place would be the location as its tough coming from Daly City and trying to find parking. We just got lucky this time ;)Side note:  they ran out of fresh oysters around 2pm so not sure how early you'll have to come to get some!
So fresh, I half imagine the fish to just keep swimming, just keep swimming...Okay, that's a disturbing thought, but the fish here are serious eats.Although Basa Seafood Express with a worn-out awning and unassuming exterior looks like a place you would not trust to be consuming raw fish from, I agree with fellow Yelpers that their food preparation process is quite clean. The interior is starkly down-to-earth, which may be non-ideal especially if you are used to all the ambiancey Japanese restaurants in SF. I therefore suggest take-out--there's nothing more badass than coming home with fresh sashimi cuts from the fish market.They serve a limited selection of sashimi, including tuna, salmon, and hamachi. It comes in large butcher slabs of different sizes, so you have your pick for appropriate portions and pricing. Other items of interest include creamy poke, diced sashimi, and ceviche. They make sushi rolls as well: made-to-order maki for which there seems to be some sort of ongoing BOGO deal, and pre-packed California roll/nigiri combos (similar to the to-go sushi you see at Whole Foods, only without the brown rice avocado sushi and other Whole Foodsy options).I went with the tuna and salmon (boring I know... but classic) because the poke looked a bit too creamy to me. I also picked up a CA roll/nigiri for good measure, and the total came down $28 total for a yummy sashimi meal for two. This does require some work and creativity on your part, but it can be as minimal as slicing the fish and throwing stuff together. We even got take-out rice from a Chinese restaurant instead of making sushi rice :3 I added some arugula and wasabi furikake and it was delish. I only wish they offered me wasabi and ginger, since I forgot to ask so all we had were the small dollops from the sushi box.I know haters may complain about the use of disposable plastic containers; honestly though, I don't know how well fish could last in paper or whether BYOB for sashimi would be feasible. What about those expensive biodegradable take-out boxes you may ask? In my opinion the display in the black plastic boxes with clear lids is something of a tradition, an integral part of fish market sashimi, and practical as well for selecting your piece of choice while ensuring no contamination among pieces. The verdict? I still have qualms eating raw fish not prepared by an official restaurant, but there were no adverse GI reactions. DIY sashimi is a good idea.... the same $$$ could probably only have gotten me a chirashi or the cheapest sashimi combo at a sushi bar.
It's a dirty, depressing spot. (I felt like I needed a therapist after I left.) the sushi lacked flavor. They use imitation crab. The clam chowder needs more salt. I suspect better for delivery.

I only wish they offered me wasabi and ginger, since I forgot to ask so all we had were the small dollops from the sushi box.I know haters may complain about the use of disposable plastic containers; honestly though, I don't know how well fish could last in paper or whether BYOB for sashimi would be feasible. What about those expensive biodegradable take-out boxes you may ask? In my opinion the display in the black plastic boxes with clear lids is something of a tradition, an integral part of fish market sashimi, and practical as well for selecting your piece of choice while ensuring no contamination among pieces. The verdict? I still have qualms eating raw fish not prepared by an official restaurant, but there were no adverse GI reactions. DIY sashimi is a good idea.... the same $$$ could probably only have gotten me a chirashi or the cheapest sashimi combo at a sushi bar.
It's a dirty, depressing spot. (I felt like I needed a therapist after I left.) the sushi lacked flavor. They use imitation crab. The clam chowder needs more salt. I suspect better for delivery.
This is what an ideal one dollar sign place should be--no frill simple food, but extremely fresh and on point because of the volume.I went there last week to find some fresh seafood. However, I could not find the specialty item I was looking for (however, they seemed to have good collection of typical seafood such as salmon, shrimp, oysters etc). However, as I was already there I decided to order their salmon burger and it was definitely one of the best I have had (even when compared to higher end restaurants).It was a no frill burger with some fresh veggies and an extremely fresh piece of salmon freshly grilled. The best part was that the salmon tasted super fresh and that experience is rare in even mid range restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised and I will go back there more to just get that fresh salmon burger!
Spicy Salmon Poke: 3.5 (+0.5 for the Masago.) Tuna: 2 (Texture was Slightly Tough)Clam Chowder:  2.5 (Lacked Flavor)Caterpillar Roll: 4 (Ironically, I liked this the best.)Volcano Roll: 2 (All I tasted was Rice.)Basa is a basically a hole in the wall fish market with limited table and seats. Prices are reasonable, but the poke wasn't as great as I expected because of all the 4 star ratings. Overall, a 3 star experience.P.S. If you want rice, you have to order it as a side. For people dining in, you pay at the end.
The spicy salmon poke was alright - $6. Wasn't very much fish, but I guess for $6, and in SF, it was a good price. It doesn't come with sushi or regular rice. You can get regular rice for $1 extra. DIdn't think it was worth it for a bunch of rice and very little fish.The fish ceviche was VERY good!! I think this definitely justified $6. It is stored in the fridge in a cup. Didn't come with a tostada chip (only with saltines) whcih is a bummer. But I ate it with the spoon and called it the day.
Been wanting to try this place, can never go wrong with some good poke!Came here around 6PM, wasn't too packed. Pretty small area, you go in and it kind of looks like a fish supermarket. You see all the fishes, poke and everything displayed inside the fridges. You pay first then wait for your food.We ordered:Salmon poke: Pretty good for $6, they had some caviar, I wouldn't say it's the best I had.Oysters: Do not order, wasn't good at ALL. It had no flavor, I felt like I was eating salt water.Fish ceviche: Do not recommend, tasted like water no flavorOverall, I don't think I would come back here again, I would go to Pokeatery in San Mateo instead.
I eely need to clam down because Basa cod not do batter in keeping their food fresh, tasty, and cheap. If you want, you can ask salmon else for their opinion, but I bait they will say the same thing! Okay, had way too much fun writing that intro. But let's get down to business: Basa's food is so cheap for SF Bay Area standards. And more importantly, their fish is fresh! The workers at Basa were friendly, helpful, and very quick. My chowder and poke orders came out almost instantly, and the teriyaki took just 5 minutes. The clam chowder ($2.99 for small bowl) was hot, delicious, with lots of clams. Creamy and heavy as expected, with good original flavor and not overly salty (which I love). The spicy salmon poke ($6) was pretty heavily marinated and creamy, and was topped with roe, black sesame seeds, green onions. By itself it was a bit much, but when I topped it on rice back at home it balanced out to be absolutely delicious. Fresh, too! I didn't get much of a taste of the salmon teriyaki ($9.99) but BF seemed to like it (he finished it in less than 5 minutes). It was a simple plate with a hefty amount of salmon. Can't believe it took me 8 months of living here to stumble upon this place! Love you Basa -- I'll dolphinately be back!
I like going to Basa to purchase the $6 salmon cubes. They say it's about 1/3lb (or $18/lb) compared to a piece of sushi-grade salmon that runs $24.99/lb. I was going to cut it up anyway so the fact that they were already in small cubes only made my life easier.Sometimes parking is a pain but other than that, Basa is a reliable spot for some decently priced fresh fish.
I've ordered delivery from here through Caviar several times and tried a couple of the rolls and nigiri. Prices are cheap for decent, basic sushi. The fish is always fresh but occasionally doesn't seem to be from particularly a great cut and isn't as flavorful or tender as I would like. Rolls and nigiri are well made, a tinyyy bit heavy on the rice but definitely better than anything you'll find at other places of the same price point. The salmon poke is creamy, flavorful, and delicious! But I would suggest adding a bit of rice to go with it since it doesn't come with any.Overall, affordable, everyday sushi. Don't expect uni or o-toro, but this will satisfy your sushi lunch craving on a budget!
Good street style tacos and sushi. Much better than I expected. Stopped in for a quick lunch. Two tacos and two sushi rolls for under $20. We just happened by. If you're in the area and in the mood for good no frills food, this is a good bet.
I dropped by in the middle of the day for lunch and ordered clam chowder and the spicy tuna roll. Service: Staff were friendly. No complaints.Food: As an avid fan of clam chowder, I was quite disappointed. It came to me lukewarm and tasted quite bland. The spicy tuna roll, on the other hand, was pretty good! It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but definitely good enough to fix my sushi cravings. Ambiance: Nothing fancy. Relatively clean. There are a few tables inside for dining in.Price: Affordable! $5.50 for a spicy tuna roll (8 pieces, although a bit on the small side). Overall: I would definitely come back to try more of their menu, but not their clam chowder.
Delicious little hole-in-the-wall sushi place. I recommend getting take-out and picnicking in a local park. The poke was great as was the salmon roll we got, although I imagine everything here is good. Price was a steal for the quality.
Usually in a hurry to catch one of the all-too-rare MUNI 12-Line buses, I never paid much attention to this small 24th Street seafood market out of pure ignorance. I didn't know they had a little cafe set-up in the back until I took a longer look at which point I took a look at the Yelp app and saw a flood of glowing reviews. OK, I should give this a try since there's a lonely formica table with my name on it. Not literally but I put my backpack on one of the empty chairs to secure a space. Perusing the overhead menu, I was struck at the variety of seafood you could order - sandwiches, ceviches, sushi, tacos, oysters, poke, clam chowder (photo: bit.ly/1WqhULY). Could they possibly prepare everything that well?I started with my usual sushi litmus test, a $9.95 Rainbow Roll (photo: bit.ly/20mp83b). It was prepared in a no-frills manner with just tuna and salmon offered on the outside. Inside was more like a California roll since a crab salad and avocado made up the filling. It was quite fresh-tasting, so I had no complaints on their variation on it. The price was certainly right. Speaking of which, I also went for a medium $3.99 cup of the Clam Chowder, which bolted me from Japan to Maine with the first spoonful (photo: bit.ly/1GHrR0z). Thick with a good amount of clams, it wasn't overly creamy which made me happy as I usually find an overuse of cream overwhelms the freshness of a chowder. Not here though as it was quite satisfying.I felt a need to try the $10 half-dozen order of Marin Miyagi Oysters, which were as fresh and briny which I was hoping they would be (photo: bit.ly/1GHrQKg). Presented on a large tray of ice, they were gone quickly since I am an expert slurper. The three squeeze bottles of hot sauces also helped them go down the gullet easily. Because I was not quite sated, I finished my meal off with a couple of $1.99 Fish Tacos (photo: bit.ly/1HmCdxH). Although full of fresh ingredients including what I believe was cod, the tacos were not quite at the level as the other goodies. I think what I learned was to stick with the items where the seafood is the main event. Regardless, the prices are right, and the selection wide-ranging enough to make anyone happy.FOOD - 4 stars...fresh seafood sold by the pound or in a variety of dishes in a no-frills wayAMBIANCE - 3 stars...just a few tables and chairs surrounded by a lot of fishSERVICE - 4 stars...order at the counter and they come serve you pretty quicklyTOTAL - 4 stars...an unusual seaworthy find deep in the Mission well worth seeking out
The poke is so good! It's pretty small but it's only 5$ and worth it! I got the salmon one and it really gives me life frfr! The clam chowder is bomb. The staff is very friendly. The place is kind of like a market and not really restauranty~ but I recommend!
They never fail to impress. I'm in love with their fish and chips, and shrimp and chips. Not a big fan of their combo. The salmon poke was great. I wish I could try their clam chowder but it has bacon in it.
All your basa are belong to me.But really, we ordered about 10% of their menu because it was JUST SO DANG AFFORDABLE. Also, we eat with our eyes. Gobble gobble glare.Between my friend and I, we shared two $6 poke dishes (tuna and spicy salmon), $7.99 fish & chips, $6.50 clam chowder bread bowl, two $2 fish tacos, and a $4.99 side order of seaweed. My favorite was the poke because I love me some raw fish, especially when it's cheap. The fish and chips were hot and crispy, and I liked the fact that their breading is bread crumbs rather than a flour-based coating. The clam chowder and fish tacos did their job in filling the belly. And the seaweed is always greener, in somebody else's lake ;)Go to Basa for poke so that all their basa can belong to you too.
Perfect example of a hole in the wall. Dropped by Basa Seafood Express to get a small fix of fresh fish before ending of day of sight seeing through SF. This spot serves as both a fish market and restaurant towards the back, however with limited seating. We ordered fresh tuna (which they were able to cut into pieces for us to eat), poke and a roll. All items were decently priced and each piece was delish! Service was quick and although the market appeared a little outdated, it was clean.
YUM this place was great!!!! I took le fiance on a surprise date this past weekend, and was looking for some place in the area to eat before we went to Urban Putt Putt. We had literally JUST been talking about how we had been too broke of late to eat sushi and we were both craving it, so when this place popped up I knew we had to go!! So the problem with us is not that we can't afford sushi, persay, it's more like we're both pushing or over 6'0 and thus need to consume a decent amount of food to reach desired fullness levels. And sushi is just not cost effective at most places. But this place was great! The fish was fresh, the menu was intriguing, and we had an amazing meal. Between us we split some spicy salmon poke, a dragon roll, and a plate of fried oysters, fish and shrimp. Service left a little to be desired but eh, what can you do. With that fresh fish at those prices, I'd put up with a lot worse.
Bookmarked Basa after reading Cherylynn's glowing review.  We headed there to pick up scallops and to grab a bite to eat.  I got the soft shell crab sandwich and he got the fish and chips.  Sandwich had lightly fried soft shell crab topped with lettuce, tomato and onion with (homemade?) tartar sauce on the side.  His fish and chips were in a cornmeal coating and lightly fried.  Both were simple but still pleasing and fresh.  The scallops were $18 a pound and they were huge!  I enjoyed them later that night.  Glad to see Basa in the area offering affordable seafood and some cheap lunch eats as well.
Omg, finally tried this place out!!! Poke was so perfect for this sunny day and this place has been bookmarked for months. Glad I finally checked it off my list. Ok, so let's see. Getting here isn't too bad but it's the Mission so prepare for a shortage of parking and lots of traffic coming to this area. Once you're in though, prepare for magic in your mouth. Basa Seafood Express is a gem that I probably wouldn't have known about if it wasn't for my fellow Yelpers. This place could be easy to pass up as it looks like any old seafood market on the street.  But once you go in, you will see a variety of fresh fish, ceviche, poke and cooked foods at the back. When I first entered, the place was fairly bright with lights which made it easy to spot the food. You could just see how fresh the fish was and how clean the place is. I ended up getting the spicy salmon poke which is the best $6 I've ever spent on food and their fish tacos ($2 each). I am a sucker for raw salmon and this poke was absolutely amazing!! I can't tell you how perfectly spicy it was and how fresh the salmon tasted. The fish tacos were average, nothing to rave about here but the poke was too delicious. Portion wasn't too bad for $6 but I wasn't full after one order of it. Seating is minimal, they've got 5 tables max which can probably seat 12 people at most. You also don't pay for your food until the end of your meal and you pay at the front register. Service was good, the owner offered us water and one of the customers kept recommending the salmon burger so I may have to try that next time. Overall, I would come back only for the poke as I didn't try anything else (not counting the fish tacos which you can easily get anywhere). Also, they appear or deliver! Maybe I'll try their delivery service next time since I'm usually really lazy to drive into the city. 5 stars for poke, 5 stars for the price, 5 stars for the service. Only thing I would change about this place would be the location as its tough coming from Daly City and trying to find parking. We just got lucky this time ;)Side note:  they ran out of fresh oysters around 2pm so not sure how early you'll have to come to get some!
So fresh, I half imagine the fish to just keep swimming, just keep swimming...Okay, that's a disturbing thought, but the fish here are serious eats.Although Basa Seafood Express with a worn-out awning and unassuming exterior looks like a place you would not trust to be consuming raw fish from, I agree with fellow Yelpers that their food preparation process is quite clean. The interior is starkly down-to-earth, which may be non-ideal especially if you are used to all the ambiancey Japanese restaurants in SF. I therefore suggest take-out--there's nothing more badass than coming home with fresh sashimi cuts from the fish market.They serve a limited selection of sashimi, including tuna, salmon, and hamachi. It comes in large butcher slabs of different sizes, so you have your pick for appropriate portions and pricing. Other items of interest include creamy poke, diced sashimi, and ceviche. They make sushi rolls as well: made-to-order maki for which there seems to be some sort of ongoing BOGO deal, and pre-packed California roll/nigiri combos (similar to the to-go sushi you see at Whole Foods, only without the brown rice avocado sushi and other Whole Foodsy options).I went with the tuna and salmon (boring I know... but classic) because the poke looked a bit too creamy to me. I also picked up a CA roll/nigiri for good measure, and the total came down $28 total for a yummy sashimi meal for two. This does require some work and creativity on your part, but it can be as minimal as slicing the fish and throwing stuff together. We even got take-out rice from a Chinese restaurant instead of making sushi rice :3 I added some arugula and wasabi furikake and it was delish. I only wish they offered me wasabi and ginger, since I forgot to ask so all we had were the small dollops from the sushi box.I know haters may complain about the use of disposable plastic containers; honestly though, I don't know how well fish could last in paper or whether BYOB for sashimi would be feasible. What about those expensive biodegradable take-out boxes you may ask? In my opinion the display in the black plastic boxes with clear lids is something of a tradition, an integral part of fish market sashimi, and practical as well for selecting your piece of choice while ensuring no contamination among pieces. The verdict? I still have qualms eating raw fish not prepared by an official restaurant, but there were no adverse GI reactions. DIY sashimi is a good idea.... the same $$$ could probably only have gotten me a chirashi or the cheapest sashimi combo at a sushi bar.

I therefore suggest take-out--there's nothing more badass than coming home with fresh sashimi cuts from the fish market.They serve a limited selection of sashimi, including tuna, salmon, and hamachi. It comes in large butcher slabs of different sizes, so you have your pick for appropriate portions and pricing. Other items of interest include creamy poke, diced sashimi, and ceviche. They make sushi rolls as well: made-to-order maki for which there seems to be some sort of ongoing BOGO deal, and pre-packed California roll/nigiri combos (similar to the to-go sushi you see at Whole Foods, only without the brown rice avocado sushi and other Whole Foodsy options).I went with the tuna and salmon (boring I know... but classic) because the poke looked a bit too creamy to me. I also picked up a CA roll/nigiri for good measure, and the total came down $28 total for a yummy sashimi meal for two. This does require some work and creativity on your part, but it can be as minimal as slicing the fish and throwing stuff together. We even got take-out rice from a Chinese restaurant instead of making sushi rice :3 I added some arugula and wasabi furikake and it was delish. I only wish they offered me wasabi and ginger, since I forgot to ask so all we had were the small dollops from the sushi box.I know haters may complain about the use of disposable plastic containers; honestly though, I don't know how well fish could last in paper or whether BYOB for sashimi would be feasible. What about those expensive biodegradable take-out boxes you may ask? In my opinion the display in the black plastic boxes with clear lids is something of a tradition, an integral part of fish market sashimi, and practical as well for selecting your piece of choice while ensuring no contamination among pieces. The verdict? I still have qualms eating raw fish not prepared by an official restaurant, but there were no adverse GI reactions. DIY sashimi is a good idea.... the same $$$ could probably only have gotten me a chirashi or the cheapest sashimi combo at a sushi bar.
It's a dirty, depressing spot. (I felt like I needed a therapist after I left.) the sushi lacked flavor. They use imitation crab. The clam chowder needs more salt. I suspect better for delivery.
