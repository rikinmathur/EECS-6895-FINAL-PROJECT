Awesome huge playground located in the beautiful Golden gates park. It's such an awesome playground that even my cousin and BFF wanted to play....and we did. When you first arise at the playground area there is a sign that says "Adults must be a companies by kids." Which is awesome so you can weed out the creepers. We need one here at home in LA to warn the creepers supposedly going to the park their niece/nephew, children they babysit goes to without the kids because that's just....CREEPY!. The kids aren't there why are you? Looking to take someone else's? Yah no thanks!Anyhow this awesome park are separated into multiple sections; one for the playground for little kids, and one for the bigger kids, the cement slide on top of the hill with multiple cardboard for you to use to slide down (So fun!), a carousel, seasonal concessions stands. The play ground had this rope climbing pyramid spiderman is contraption which was awesome. Their was wave like structure that kids would climb on to. It's like thee most awesome play ground everrrrrrrrr! I always bring my kids at least once when we're in SF. This is definitely a must go place if you're visiting with kids (^_^) Be prepared to meet your inner child as you squeal with excitement at the park
The carousel is still here and the snack bar is in full swing! I'm a nostalgia filled soul so taking my offspring here is a true tear jerker! I love the new playground set up especially the spider Web rope climbing structure... I think I'm on it more than my kids are.*** And the cement slide that has brought so many knuckle scrapes and ripped jeans into my life, I thank you for standing the test of time and being the reason why I look out for "the best pieces of cardboard." I love thee.I just wish that there was rubber vs. sand as the surface... cat poo is not cool.
This is definitly a clean, open playground with some fun play structures. The carousel is also an adventure in itself, although we only got in one ride before they closed. The negatives for me were the sand my newly walking 10.5 month old occasionally slipped on and tried to eat numerous times. Also, very little shade over the play structures.
My kids love this playground! It is clean and safe. Carrousel is available for a small fee. After playing at the park, I like to go to restaurants that are around the area. Very convenient!
This is an awesome playground for kids.  The highlight is the slide off the hill that you need cardboard to go down. Slightly dangerous,but that is part of the fun.  The Mister took the LO on it and she had fun. The playground equipment was cool, but it was too hot to play on them too long.
This playground is AWESOME. Even I want to play in it! (Actually I did... I went on the concrete slides and spinning pods with my 2 year old niece.)  This playground is only a hop, skip, and a jump away from the carousel.  The playground has many features which makes this park THE place that kids of all ages want to come.  Slides, swings, climbing stuctures, spinning pods, sand boxes.. such a fun park!  Must check this place out yourself with your little ones.  They will have a blast and you will too!
Nice family park. The huge carousel makes a great addition to the fun. You can bring your own blanket and snacks but if you don't they have many seating areas and a food stand.
what can i say. i grew up in SF and this is the park where my parents would bring me and my siblings to when we were younger. Hold many fun memories for me. Of course many play structures are no longer there when I was a kid. Even with that some of the popular one still remain and enjoyed by many children. The slide made of cement, the only way you're going down is use a card board box. Yup! Still great. My kids had a blast. The park are well kept and maintained. The kids and families that go here are friendly.
Awesome playground, beautifully located BUT there are a ton of homeless people very close by, it doesn't feel very safe. No real shade to play in.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this park! Its really clean, they have a carousel and best of all they have a sand pit area. My daughter loves the sand and she also loves the baby swings so I love that this park is a "one stop shop" for all that my daughter likes to do.The weather is always a little better in this part of San Francisco and parking never seems to be a problem. Granted, I have only gone on weekdays for this specific reason.Its a little funny to me that this gorgeous and awesome children's playground it RIGHT next to "hippie hill" where all the kids go to smoke weed. Its never a problem really besides when I was going to the restroom and there was a young man smoking weed right outside where there are tons of kids running around. Come on!
Great cement slide bring your cardboard playground area is filled with sand happy smiling yelling kids, the ground is soft made from that recycle spongy stuff. Has a carousel that goes round and round with horses only couple bucks. Concession stand available for hot dogs drinks , and ice for the occasional fall. Parking kind of hard to find but you should be walking anyway.
What can I say about this playground that hasn't already been said. It's huge, fun and amazing. It gets really crowded on the weekends, which is expected, but it's very manageable on weekdays. Not only are the kids totally entertained when they are here, the lounging parents/guardians are also really friendly.
My kids loved this park very big and spacious but the only down fall is the restroom was so far
The Golden Gate Park in San Francisco is full of history, culture, botany and things FUN! If you have children from toddler age to tweens you might want to checkout...THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND AKA KORET CHILDREN'S QUARTER!It's packed with mischievous fun, for rug-rats looking to get dirty and PLAY! The way it should be! As a former teacher I can say this is one of the best children's park out there! Knee scrapes & band-aids might be part of the adventure, but it's FUN! There's a massive jungle gym that's like a mini village, slides of all-sort and many other fun interactive things like the sand dunes, rope climb, swings, wave-climbing wall, and of course the double slide you enter at the top of a long flight of steps! FUN!The wonderful Children's Playground at Golden Gate Park was reopened in 2007 and renamed the "Koret Children's Quarter". As you enter the large play area, the laughter and energy of children fills the air! Playing is part of being a child! The foundation of the playground was established in the late 1880's, but there is something special here that many playgrounds do not offer- an authentic antique carousel. This historic gem provides an amazing center of wonder! The Children's Quarter is marked with a sense of youthfulness and invigorating FUN!One of my lovely nieces loves to have her birthday party here. Always with a truckload of her friends. The girls she can play with and the boys she can push off hay stacks! Yup, don't mess with her! FUN! Plus, lots of picnic tables and open area for the adults to eat a sandwich and wait for the little ones! It's a wonderful place for children to play and use all those motor skills they are blessed with! Have them play here, so when they get home all that built up energy is spent at the playground! Good idea, huh?Carousel Ride Cost: Adults & teens $2, children ages 6 to 12 years $1 per ride, and children 5 and under are free when accompanied by a paying adult. Please note that children under 40″ in height must ride with a paying adult. The park itself is free for all! Yes, I definitely recommend...THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND AKA KORET CHILDREN'S QUARTER!Let your children PLAY and be children! For goodness sakes it's the right thing to do! Instead of a load of video games and a tiara! Just make sure to bring a sandwich and a book 'cause you might be here for awhile! SOLID. Hey, it's free! 4.7-STARS!
Amazing place for kids of all ages. The Golden Gate Park is a gem. You could spend days perhaps even weeks exploring everything it has to offer. We focused on the children's park and our daughter had a blast!
Fun for adults and children. Bring several old cardboard boxes for you, your child and another family to slide on down the concrete slide.
Huge and nice playground for kids and big kids to enjoy, this one even has a cardboard slide, pretty fun thing to do when its not muddy :)
Memories... all loving and so full of warmth. Playgrounds are my type of thing, and I try to see and experience all types of playgrounds around the world. Korea has great playgrounds, for ALL ages. In my hometown, San Francisco, this is the place to play on sandy and green grounds.Talk about where do I start? Which thingy ma jig do I want to tackle? The swings are always a never fail option, because you feel like you're soaring up into the sky, and you can hear the slush of wind wooping next to your ears.The monkey bars... yes they are difficult, but so much fun. The circular contraption where you hold on for dear life, as someone strong pushes it to go merry go round, and you come out dazed and confused, and sometimes you hit the ground.The deep concrete slides, where you get a flat cardboard box as your vehicle of choice, are scary at first, but when you begin to slide down, oh it's so much fun!The circular swing, where one person sits on one side, and the other sits opposite from you, is soft and caring, and you can't help but to smile. :)Oh I miss my childhood days at this great playground, situated among green giants of wonderful oxygen giving trees.I will go back very soon! This time around with other adults, who haven't forgotten their youth.
Not sure what the big deal is about this kids park. Its just like any other park. Nothing great. You can visit with your kids if you have never been there.
Fun little playground in the midst of the park.Interesting concrete slide built into a little hillside.  There are large pieces of cardboard on which you can sit.  These are supposed to aid you in sliding down faster.  Not so much.  You still get stuck, but its kinda fun for the kids.Clean bathrooms are located not too far from the playground.

My daughter loves the sand and she also loves the baby swings so I love that this park is a "one stop shop" for all that my daughter likes to do.The weather is always a little better in this part of San Francisco and parking never seems to be a problem. Granted, I have only gone on weekdays for this specific reason.Its a little funny to me that this gorgeous and awesome children's playground it RIGHT next to "hippie hill" where all the kids go to smoke weed. Its never a problem really besides when I was going to the restroom and there was a young man smoking weed right outside where there are tons of kids running around. Come on!
Great cement slide bring your cardboard playground area is filled with sand happy smiling yelling kids, the ground is soft made from that recycle spongy stuff. Has a carousel that goes round and round with horses only couple bucks. Concession stand available for hot dogs drinks , and ice for the occasional fall. Parking kind of hard to find but you should be walking anyway.
What can I say about this playground that hasn't already been said. It's huge, fun and amazing. It gets really crowded on the weekends, which is expected, but it's very manageable on weekdays. Not only are the kids totally entertained when they are here, the lounging parents/guardians are also really friendly.
My kids loved this park very big and spacious but the only down fall is the restroom was so far
The Golden Gate Park in San Francisco is full of history, culture, botany and things FUN! If you have children from toddler age to tweens you might want to checkout...THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND AKA KORET CHILDREN'S QUARTER!It's packed with mischievous fun, for rug-rats looking to get dirty and PLAY! The way it should be! As a former teacher I can say this is one of the best children's park out there! Knee scrapes & band-aids might be part of the adventure, but it's FUN! There's a massive jungle gym that's like a mini village, slides of all-sort and many other fun interactive things like the sand dunes, rope climb, swings, wave-climbing wall, and of course the double slide you enter at the top of a long flight of steps! FUN!The wonderful Children's Playground at Golden Gate Park was reopened in 2007 and renamed the "Koret Children's Quarter". As you enter the large play area, the laughter and energy of children fills the air! Playing is part of being a child! The foundation of the playground was established in the late 1880's, but there is something special here that many playgrounds do not offer- an authentic antique carousel. This historic gem provides an amazing center of wonder! The Children's Quarter is marked with a sense of youthfulness and invigorating FUN!One of my lovely nieces loves to have her birthday party here. Always with a truckload of her friends. The girls she can play with and the boys she can push off hay stacks! Yup, don't mess with her! FUN! Plus, lots of picnic tables and open area for the adults to eat a sandwich and wait for the little ones! It's a wonderful place for children to play and use all those motor skills they are blessed with! Have them play here, so when they get home all that built up energy is spent at the playground! Good idea, huh?Carousel Ride Cost: Adults & teens $2, children ages 6 to 12 years $1 per ride, and children 5 and under are free when accompanied by a paying adult. Please note that children under 40″ in height must ride with a paying adult. The park itself is free for all! Yes, I definitely recommend...THE CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND AKA KORET CHILDREN'S QUARTER!Let your children PLAY and be children! For goodness sakes it's the right thing to do! Instead of a load of video games and a tiara! Just make sure to bring a sandwich and a book 'cause you might be here for awhile! SOLID. Hey, it's free! 4.7-STARS!
Amazing place for kids of all ages. The Golden Gate Park is a gem. You could spend days perhaps even weeks exploring everything it has to offer. We focused on the children's park and our daughter had a blast!
Fun for adults and children. Bring several old cardboard boxes for you, your child and another family to slide on down the concrete slide.
Huge and nice playground for kids and big kids to enjoy, this one even has a cardboard slide, pretty fun thing to do when its not muddy :)
Memories... all loving and so full of warmth. Playgrounds are my type of thing, and I try to see and experience all types of playgrounds around the world. Korea has great playgrounds, for ALL ages. In my hometown, San Francisco, this is the place to play on sandy and green grounds.Talk about where do I start? Which thingy ma jig do I want to tackle? The swings are always a never fail option, because you feel like you're soaring up into the sky, and you can hear the slush of wind wooping next to your ears.The monkey bars... yes they are difficult, but so much fun. The circular contraption where you hold on for dear life, as someone strong pushes it to go merry go round, and you come out dazed and confused, and sometimes you hit the ground.The deep concrete slides, where you get a flat cardboard box as your vehicle of choice, are scary at first, but when you begin to slide down, oh it's so much fun!The circular swing, where one person sits on one side, and the other sits opposite from you, is soft and caring, and you can't help but to smile. :)Oh I miss my childhood days at this great playground, situated among green giants of wonderful oxygen giving trees.I will go back very soon! This time around with other adults, who haven't forgotten their youth.
Not sure what the big deal is about this kids park. Its just like any other park. Nothing great. You can visit with your kids if you have never been there.
Fun little playground in the midst of the park.Interesting concrete slide built into a little hillside.  There are large pieces of cardboard on which you can sit.  These are supposed to aid you in sliding down faster.  Not so much.  You still get stuck, but its kinda fun for the kids.Clean bathrooms are located not too far from the playground.
