For what it is it's so amazing.Drive-in style burger with all the fixings, greasy fries, and banana milk shake that is out of this freakin world. Plus you get to experience the drama of S Van Ness in all its glory. People running red lights, pretentious bike riders cursing at cars... And crazy people coming up to you giving lectures about how the military is all effed up and by the way can I have some change?Freakin glorious
I love stepping back into history of this walk-up, drive-in looking place out of the 1950s. (Actually, it was built in 1950).   Living in SF for years, I stumbled upon this place once walking home from work, and enjoy visiting it whenever I'm back in the city.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention the food -  typical greasy drive-in style burgers.   You're going mostly for the atmosphere, and get pleasantly surprised by the burgers and shakes.
Walked home the wrong way and couldn't help but stop by this retro joint!It looked promising, and the wait indicated that the food was fresh. The chicken wings were piping hot, crunchy, and packed with flavor. The fries bummed me out though. I ate two and threw the rest away. Solid strawberry milkshake as well. I'll come back for the shake, but prefer korean chicken wings over these dry ones.
I love this place!  The milkshakes are simply amazing, especially the coffee flavor.  For the price point they make a really good veggie burger and fries too.  Definitely give this one a go!
Look at SF's top 10 burger places and Whiz is one of them! Don't let the looks put you off! The moment you open the brown bag with fries and you take a look at the perfectly crisped potato sticks, your heart starts beating faster! But it's only after you take the first bite into your burger that you let your guards fully down and admit to yourself that it's love at first bite! I had the quarter pound burger with added cheese and mushrooms and it was the best I'd had in loooong! Not a bit greasy as some others described it! It was really good, but hey! Don't expect a gourmet experience here! Am sure it's gonna be my go-to burger place when the craving hits again. Two thumbs up to Whiz!
I think one of the previous reviews hit the nail on the head "greasy, hot, fresh, disgusting, and perfect."Whiz Burger doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. Once you accept that, you will be happy. This place is a hangover go-to. Garlic fries are greasy, soggy, mega garlicky, and delicious. Burgers are OK. Their shakes are legit. I do not recommend the cheese steak.
Ok. I'd read that a prominent SF chef loves this place.I thought, if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me.Yes, it does have an overall decrepit look about it.There's no denying that this joint could use some serious TLC.But, we can all use a little, or a lot, of TLC, can't we?I saw that they have a perfect health score.  I found this reassuring.So, crumbling facade aside, I focused on the food.  Meaning...the burger.How surprised was I (very) when I took my first bite of the Whiz Burger.  It was fresh, it was tasty.  Simple & a little messy.  That's good.  A lot of previous reviewers have called it classic, & that's exactly what it is...A classic burger.It's very reminiscent of an old school backyard burger from a prior era.  A burger that Edith would have made for Archie Bunker.If it's good enough for Archie Bunker...4 stars.
Do you want a burger? Of course you do. Classic, simple, burgers made at a joint that doesn't presume to be more than the greasy corner burger shack it is. The shakes and malts are terrific, and pair well with the burger when you're really feeling like punishing your heart and rewarding your taste buds!
Whiz Burger: It's just the best.They have a veggie burger! You can add avocado!The seasoned (waffle) fries are delicious. And the root beer float is a tall foamy classic at the lowest price in town.
Finally made it to this place and it was glorious!  I know it's a burger joint but I have no power over my order if there are hotdogs or corn dogs on the menu...and that's what I got.  They slice the dog in half and serve it on a hoagie-ish bun which was great, sat flat, no spills, awesomely spicy.  Corn dog was properly fried and delicious.  Solid milkshake...the place is open air in a so-so part of town so keep an eye out for panhandlers.  Don't expect anything fancy from this place other than good food.  I'm surprised people are complaining about the neighborhood or the service, seriously, what did you expect??
Support small local businesses! :-)My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick burger place to go to and came across Whiz Burgers on Yelp. We got good vibes all around from the place, the employee who took our order, as well as the other customers eating. I ordered the junior burger combo with garlic fries & my boyfriend ordered the bacon burger combo with crisscut fries. It was all super good! And they definitely overhand the fries, which was rad. The ranch was tasty (we're really picky about our ranch haha).
what i ordered... whiz burgertypical hamburger patties and fillings served in a faux sourdough breadambiance... bad (it looks like one of 'em structure in the ol' west movies)service... so-so (a stare and a quick question but a single word of gratitude at the end)cost... $ (fair)
I normally get the Whiz Burgers with fries and a banana shake. Always delicious and the service is prompt. This location is also good for people watching.Unfortunately on my most recent visit I paid using my credit card only to find later that an extra $10 had been added to the tip despite tipping fairly in my opinion for the above meal. Won't be going back anytime soon unless I know I have cash on hand.
:( A bit of a disappointment.I stopped by to pick up 2 shakes. I chose chocolate & mango. The mango was decent but the chocolate was horrible. The wait was very long- in the time I waited I could have made the shake myself :/ . The chocolate shake tasted like it was made with Hershey's syrup :(:(:(.The prices were very reasonable.I would come again to try the banana shake & burger & fries.It would be really nice if they had an outside heat lamp for their customers.
Fast becoming my guilty pleasure...Driven by here for years, always grabbed my attention. Could it possibly be true? A fantastic, old school burger in SF? Whiz Burger, fries, Banana shake. Why, yes! Delicious!! The way the cheese melts around the bacon, sliced down the middle, wrapped like a gift! And those fries! As for the shake, I'm not really into bananas. Until now.I can feel the pounds packing on. And I just don't care.
OMG! Best burger ever! Definitely go for the whiz burger. The entire sandwich was exceptional. The meat, avocado, bacon, all was perfect. Freshness score was a 5 as well. Visiting family, we are from San Diego, and this will be a must return. Do not be fooled by the looks of the place, or neighborhood. They had a 92 on the health inspection. Loved it, the end.
Yummy fries and a decent burger- satisfied my craving! Next time- definitely getting the banana shake and criss cut fries!
Love this old school drive in. The burgers and fries are delicious. The service and employees are fast and nice. Never close please.
Easily one of my favorite burger places in the city. Whiz burger with crosscut fries and a shakeNever have had a bad experience with this place and always happy&full after one of their burgers
greasy, hot, fresh, disgusting, and perfect. whiz burger is my favorite self indulgent lunch. mmmm. it's so bad, but so so good. I hope this place is around forever.
