It was sprinkling outside a little and I'm just visiting The SoMa region of SF for a little while, so I ended up wandering in here so I could stop and wait for the Ferry Building Marketplace to open up. It's a small, trendy looking place with clean interior. I'm loving the alpaca logo (sho cyootie-patootie)! I got a small soco-latte. It's beautiful, with a chocolate covered marshmallow garnishing the top. Creamiest. Dreamiest. Ever. I always love a good, well-foamed latte, and this was so smooth! I scooped up a bit of the foam with a spoon and was in heaven. Not too sweet, but warming and rich in flavor.They had some chocolate samples out and I tried the Marsala Chai and one with Raspberry Champagne. I don't think I really noticed the flavor of the Chai, but the smoothness was definitely outstanding. The raspberry was flavored really well and actually made me start considering a small box despite their super high prices. My wallet is crying a little, but I'm still trying to decide as I type this in the cafe!!! Yelp DOES have a 10% off deal for first-time check-ins.....and they have some pretty interesting flavors out like cognac and hot lava and sriracha.....so....... Brb going to buy chocolate now.
I'm a fan because this is more than just a chocolate shop. I'm in love with their guava croissant. Whether I'm near or far, there are moments that I crave their guava croissant.The shop has enough seating for a sit down, so it's convenient enough for me to grab n' go, or sit down and join the pastry with nice cup of coffee in this cute blue interior shop.I've also order from their lunch menu of refreshing beautiful salads and carefully crafted sandwiches. The owner or lead was also very nice over email communications when I placed a large catering/lunch order for my work meeting.I can't comment on the chocolate as I have been spoiled by Christopher Elbow chocolates, but this shop is more than just a chocolatier to me. It is my lquiet/quaint lunch spot as well.
This place is beautiful and so are there products but the prices are way too expensive. It should not cost $15 for an Espresso - To Go, "Happy Hour" pastry (especially when the mini one costs the same as the regular size.. and 2 mini Chocolate Bunnies.. The service was great but I will not be back to visit.
Their chocolates are so awesome! I wish they would open on weekends too. Their chocolate rich mocha is also awesome :)
Whimsical and novel flavor choices in their truffles Atmosphere is bright and clean with a polished elegance Chocolate was smooth and rich with just a hint of bitternessSome of the flavors were unnoticeable and others more forthcoming (samples are your friend) Packaging is reminiscent of something you get from Tiffany's Overall ThoughtsIf you are in need of a chocolate fix you can't go wrong with Socola
Some say the way to a girl's heart is chocolate. Not me. I don't care for chocolate unless I'm PMSing which Mr. NSS may argue that's an e-v-e-r-y-d-a-y occurrence. Have fun with PALMela and that bottle of Lubriderm, buddy!Ok. So admittedly, I may be a crazy banshee during those "trying" days but he knows the way to my heart (and how to shut me up): DURIAN, the king of fruits. Yes, that deliciously vile smell of stank feet putrefying in a mixture of cow dung, rotten eggs, and rancid fish with a sprinkling of gasoline that even Andrew Zimmern (Bizarre Foods) refuses to eat makes me giggle with excitement. If you can ignore the smell, you will be rewarded with an incredibly velvety smooth, sweet custard-like fruit with hints of vanilla, nuts, and a touch of garlic. I heard that Socola had a durian truffle flavor but was only available seasonally. Well, after a year of trying (they sell out quickly), I gave up. However, last week, I get an email from Wendy, the owner and she tells me they have the durian truffles in stock! YEEEE! She was kind enough to put a dozen aside for me and I told her I would be there during the weekend to pick it up.The next day, Mr. NSS met me at my office after work and hands me a teal gift bag. I peak inside and they're durian truffles from Socola: bit.ly/1yVJGzt! Apparently, he got on the waitlist too. Good boy!Now, I've tried many durian products and the durian smell is often subtle meaning there's very little of the real thing used. Not this time...Me *slowly devours a durian truffle* "Omg, these are so good, are you sure you don't want some?" *purposely breathes on him*Mr. NSS *moves away from me* "Good gawd, THAT smell--haven't you tortured me enough?" *tosses a vibrator from across the room and leaves*Socola durian truffles: deliciously stinky sweet P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N.
I really liked this place. They are so polite and respectful. I loved the socolatte  you should definitely try it.
12.22.14 etc.Cute chocolate and coffee shop in the SOMA hood. Inventive truffle flavors. I'm into the green tea matcha. $2.50 a piece!Quiet place for a cup of coffee as well. The socolatte comes with a piece of marshmallow!yelp.com/biz_photos/soco…
Eating the guava croissant was about as close as I will ever get to having a religious experience.
With the help of a successful Kickstarter campaign, a pair of enterprising Vietnamese-American sisters opened a boutique chocolate shop that feels like a box of chocolates, Forrest Gump-approved. It's a cute spot on a rather remote block of Folsom with very little pedestrian traffic. That's a bit of a shame since the chocolates are good even if they are somewhat premium-priced. Part of the challenge is that the chocolates, as tasty as some of them are, lack distinction, something unique that would make them memorable. As the trio of strippers sang to Louise in "Gypsy", you gottta have a gimmick if you wanna get applause.The sisters proclaim they make "artisanal confections with modern flavors and a fantastic taste of fun".OK but was I having fun? When do we get to the fun part? I came here with Jamie W. and noticed they're trying to be more than just a chocolate shop. They also serve espressos and pastries in an attempt to expand their budding market. We sat a spell at an open table mightily sharing a small selection of their chocolates - Passion Fruit Vanilla Bean, Burnt Baby Burnt (Burnt Caramel) with Sea Salt, Vietnamese Espresso and Bacon (photo: bit.ly/1rLzLcH).The price was high at $9.95 for a quartet, but that makes it comparable to what you would pay at Recchiuti Chocolates in the Ferry Building. Keep in mind I'm the type that gets excited at the prospect of a free chocolate square at Ghirardelli's. Socola's were tasty confections for sure, but I still think the quality at Recchiuti is better, richer, more velvety. More practice perhaps. To top it all off, I even had a $4.50 cup of the Truffogato, a Four Barrel espresso topped off with a chocolate truffle (photo: bit.ly/1pVyqk6). I was hoping for a little more kick to go with the sweet, but it never quite happened as I sipped it.CHOCOLATES - 3 stars...good but not distinctive enough to be memorable, perhaps I should have tried a durian oneAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...like a box of chocolatesSERVICE - 3.5 stars...quiet tentativenessTOTAL - 3 stars..."Get yourself a gimmick and you, too, can be a star!"
Good coffee, open later than most coffee options in SOMA. It's really close to my office which is another plus. The guy who is always working in the late afternoon is really nice and helpful. Tried the chocolate and it was okay, nothing to write home about. It's cool they make it all in house.
Socola has a nice offering of chocolates, but the staff can be moody, which is unfortunate.  A nice alternative for a coffee fix over Starbucks a block away.
I've heard of Socola way before they had this storefront when they were at the Vintner's Market at Fort Mason a few years back, and fell in love with their unique flavors, such as the sriracha flying rooster truffle & burnt caramel.So I was happy to hear that they were opening a location so close to me...these chocolates are mainly on the pricier end, but definitely worth it when you want to splurge on some amazing chocolate. I mainly frequent this place though since they Four Barrel coffee. I've only ever had their lattes and their  "soco-latte, (mocha)", which had an option of having a chocolate marshmallow added. I loved that their soco-latte wasn't too sweet. So delicious, will be back.
I stopped by to get a drip coffee and a box of four truffles. The guy at the counter showed me his two favorites (peanut butter jelly and bourbon) and I agree with him - they were outstanding. However, the other two I got (vietnamese coffee and something else - maybe caramel) were unmemorable. I'll be back to try more (their truffles and packaging are adorable) - and am planning on including another peanut butter jelly truffle in the next box for sure.Drip coffee wasn't great. Tasted chalky and too acidic for me. Should have opted for the socolatte :P.
What do you do when you see your ex from 20 years ago, the one you thought you'd move to New York for, the one who told you after you'd left him that he "regretted for not putting a ring on your finger"? You go to Kee's on West 39th and buy something decadent. Because what better way to say to a man "you screwed up and I know that you know you've screwed up" than handing him a box of chocolate?When I first walked into Socola, I told the owner this place reminded me of Kee's in Midtown. She knew what I was talking about. Nice. Very few people get my constant obnoxious New York references here in San Francisco.On my first expedition to Socola, I got durian chocolate truffles and took a photo and send it to B. I take durian very seriously. And I enjoy mocking B with it with every photo I take from every part of southeast Asia, for years now.  B hates such things and he says "yuck" back to the truffle photo and I laugh with delight. Sriracha is another good one because it packs heat. Lychee, Ginger, Guava, Beer, Cognac, and PBJ. Get a box of twelve and you get a 10% off from Yelp Check in.Today I asked the owner if she had durian. She was out she said. But after packing up 12 in a box, she handed me a durian chocolate truffle as a free bonus because they didn't have it that day for sale. I had a work related pounding headache in the afternoon, and I inhaled my treat and in five minutes I was as good as new.Socola is a small but delightful boutique chocolate cafe. It has a very inviting and clean vibe. Sort of reminds me of Fahrenheit Coffee in Toronto, a good side note: pastries are also delightful - Guava croissant feels very Miami. I now buy from Socola and not Kee's. As it turns out, chocolate is better here, just like men!
This little chocolate shop is right next to my trainer in SOMA, so I stopped in today while waiting for him to show.  Excellent hot chocolate, and a large variety of truffles (with samples on the bar).  They also have some baked goods, and prepackaged chocolate bars.Will definitely drop by often.
OMG... this place is too cute!!! Just came back from a quick morning coffee run with the coworker and at this moment... so glad that they moved around the corner from our building! Ambiance: modern decor... spacious... airy... Staff: friendly (might have been a little too wired from all the chocolate and the awesome coffee) but definitely excited and friendly! First sip of my soco-latte (I think that's the name...) "wow!" was my first word! Talk about chocolate goodness and it was made just right (temperature wise...)They sell chocolates (truffles) and pastries... which we didn't get since we were tight on time... but will definitely check them out for any last minute gifts needed ... and oh hey... VDAY is this Friday... well worth checking out lovebirds!Definitely will be my go-to coffee spot!!!
I found this place because of Cherylynn's review. I saw durian truffle and I knew I had to get them for my sister. She LOVES durian. I am not a fan at all. I heard they only make it once in awhile and I emailed Socola to let me know when they do have the durian to please let me know. The owner, Wendy (super friendly) emailed me back in 5 minutes saying she had one box left and will save it for me. I told her I want it shipped and she replied back quickly with a link to purchase. Shipping is $5. She said it might take a few days to arrive. It arrived the next day and she put a little ice pack with it also. The service was wonderful. Wendy answers your emails so quickly and is very helpful and friendly. The truffles can last in the fridge up to 3 weeks. A little pricey, but they are one of a kind. I surprised my sister with it and she said it was very good. She doesn't even like sweets, but she loved it. She said she it had a lot of durian flavor in it, so 5 stars all the way!
Very good coffee, made super fast. The shop is incredibly charming, and the chocolate is delightful. My only feedback would be that the staff could be a little more friendly - I'd like to chat more with them but they're a bit quiet. But seriously - really great coffee. And I'm from Melbourne.
Ordered just the soco-latte (mocha) with the marsh mellow on top! The marshmallow was coated in a fine chocolate powder which was awesome! The latte itself wasn't strong.The store was neat and clean. I went just before lunch on a weekday so it wasn't too busy, although the Staff seemed like they could use a little coffee themselves.Didn't try the chocolates but the soco-latte was good!
It was sprinkling outside a little and I'm just visiting The SoMa region of SF for a little while, so I ended up wandering in here so I could stop and wait for the Ferry Building Marketplace to open up. It's a small, trendy looking place with clean interior. I'm loving the alpaca logo (sho cyootie-patootie)! I got a small soco-latte. It's beautiful, with a chocolate covered marshmallow garnishing the top. Creamiest. Dreamiest. Ever. I always love a good, well-foamed latte, and this was so smooth!

We sat a spell at an open table mightily sharing a small selection of their chocolates - Passion Fruit Vanilla Bean, Burnt Baby Burnt (Burnt Caramel) with Sea Salt, Vietnamese Espresso and Bacon (photo: bit.ly/1rLzLcH).The price was high at $9.95 for a quartet, but that makes it comparable to what you would pay at Recchiuti Chocolates in the Ferry Building. Keep in mind I'm the type that gets excited at the prospect of a free chocolate square at Ghirardelli's. Socola's were tasty confections for sure, but I still think the quality at Recchiuti is better, richer, more velvety. More practice perhaps. To top it all off, I even had a $4.50 cup of the Truffogato, a Four Barrel espresso topped off with a chocolate truffle (photo: bit.ly/1pVyqk6). I was hoping for a little more kick to go with the sweet, but it never quite happened as I sipped it.CHOCOLATES - 3 stars...good but not distinctive enough to be memorable, perhaps I should have tried a durian oneAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...like a box of chocolatesSERVICE - 3.5 stars...quiet tentativenessTOTAL - 3 stars..."Get yourself a gimmick and you, too, can be a star!"
Good coffee, open later than most coffee options in SOMA. It's really close to my office which is another plus. The guy who is always working in the late afternoon is really nice and helpful. Tried the chocolate and it was okay, nothing to write home about. It's cool they make it all in house.
Socola has a nice offering of chocolates, but the staff can be moody, which is unfortunate.  A nice alternative for a coffee fix over Starbucks a block away.
I've heard of Socola way before they had this storefront when they were at the Vintner's Market at Fort Mason a few years back, and fell in love with their unique flavors, such as the sriracha flying rooster truffle & burnt caramel.So I was happy to hear that they were opening a location so close to me...these chocolates are mainly on the pricier end, but definitely worth it when you want to splurge on some amazing chocolate. I mainly frequent this place though since they Four Barrel coffee. I've only ever had their lattes and their  "soco-latte, (mocha)", which had an option of having a chocolate marshmallow added. I loved that their soco-latte wasn't too sweet. So delicious, will be back.
I stopped by to get a drip coffee and a box of four truffles. The guy at the counter showed me his two favorites (peanut butter jelly and bourbon) and I agree with him - they were outstanding. However, the other two I got (vietnamese coffee and something else - maybe caramel) were unmemorable. I'll be back to try more (their truffles and packaging are adorable) - and am planning on including another peanut butter jelly truffle in the next box for sure.Drip coffee wasn't great. Tasted chalky and too acidic for me. Should have opted for the socolatte :P.
What do you do when you see your ex from 20 years ago, the one you thought you'd move to New York for, the one who told you after you'd left him that he "regretted for not putting a ring on your finger"? You go to Kee's on West 39th and buy something decadent. Because what better way to say to a man "you screwed up and I know that you know you've screwed up" than handing him a box of chocolate?When I first walked into Socola, I told the owner this place reminded me of Kee's in Midtown. She knew what I was talking about. Nice. Very few people get my constant obnoxious New York references here in San Francisco.On my first expedition to Socola, I got durian chocolate truffles and took a photo and send it to B. I take durian very seriously. And I enjoy mocking B with it with every photo I take from every part of southeast Asia, for years now.  B hates such things and he says "yuck" back to the truffle photo and I laugh with delight. Sriracha is another good one because it packs heat. Lychee, Ginger, Guava, Beer, Cognac, and PBJ. Get a box of twelve and you get a 10% off from Yelp Check in.Today I asked the owner if she had durian. She was out she said. But after packing up 12 in a box, she handed me a durian chocolate truffle as a free bonus because they didn't have it that day for sale. I had a work related pounding headache in the afternoon, and I inhaled my treat and in five minutes I was as good as new.Socola is a small but delightful boutique chocolate cafe. It has a very inviting and clean vibe. Sort of reminds me of Fahrenheit Coffee in Toronto, a good side note: pastries are also delightful - Guava croissant feels very Miami. I now buy from Socola and not Kee's. As it turns out, chocolate is better here, just like men!
This little chocolate shop is right next to my trainer in SOMA, so I stopped in today while waiting for him to show.  Excellent hot chocolate, and a large variety of truffles (with samples on the bar).  They also have some baked goods, and prepackaged chocolate bars.Will definitely drop by often.
OMG... this place is too cute!!! Just came back from a quick morning coffee run with the coworker and at this moment... so glad that they moved around the corner from our building! Ambiance: modern decor... spacious... airy... Staff: friendly (might have been a little too wired from all the chocolate and the awesome coffee) but definitely excited and friendly! First sip of my soco-latte (I think that's the name...) "wow!" was my first word! Talk about chocolate goodness and it was made just right (temperature wise...)They sell chocolates (truffles) and pastries... which we didn't get since we were tight on time... but will definitely check them out for any last minute gifts needed ... and oh hey... VDAY is this Friday... well worth checking out lovebirds!Definitely will be my go-to coffee spot!!!
I found this place because of Cherylynn's review. I saw durian truffle and I knew I had to get them for my sister. She LOVES durian. I am not a fan at all. I heard they only make it once in awhile and I emailed Socola to let me know when they do have the durian to please let me know. The owner, Wendy (super friendly) emailed me back in 5 minutes saying she had one box left and will save it for me. I told her I want it shipped and she replied back quickly with a link to purchase. Shipping is $5. She said it might take a few days to arrive. It arrived the next day and she put a little ice pack with it also. The service was wonderful. Wendy answers your emails so quickly and is very helpful and friendly. The truffles can last in the fridge up to 3 weeks. A little pricey, but they are one of a kind. I surprised my sister with it and she said it was very good. She doesn't even like sweets, but she loved it. She said she it had a lot of durian flavor in it, so 5 stars all the way!
Very good coffee, made super fast. The shop is incredibly charming, and the chocolate is delightful. My only feedback would be that the staff could be a little more friendly - I'd like to chat more with them but they're a bit quiet. But seriously - really great coffee. And I'm from Melbourne.
Ordered just the soco-latte (mocha) with the marsh mellow on top! The marshmallow was coated in a fine chocolate powder which was awesome! The latte itself wasn't strong.The store was neat and clean. I went just before lunch on a weekday so it wasn't too busy, although the Staff seemed like they could use a little coffee themselves.Didn't try the chocolates but the soco-latte was good!
It was sprinkling outside a little and I'm just visiting The SoMa region of SF for a little while, so I ended up wandering in here so I could stop and wait for the Ferry Building Marketplace to open up. It's a small, trendy looking place with clean interior. I'm loving the alpaca logo (sho cyootie-patootie)! I got a small soco-latte. It's beautiful, with a chocolate covered marshmallow garnishing the top. Creamiest. Dreamiest. Ever. I always love a good, well-foamed latte, and this was so smooth! I scooped up a bit of the foam with a spoon and was in heaven. Not too sweet, but warming and rich in flavor.They had some chocolate samples out and I tried the Marsala Chai and one with Raspberry Champagne. I don't think I really noticed the flavor of the Chai, but the smoothness was definitely outstanding. The raspberry was flavored really well and actually made me start considering a small box despite their super high prices. My wallet is crying a little, but I'm still trying to decide as I type this in the cafe!!! Yelp DOES have a 10% off deal for first-time check-ins.....and they have some pretty interesting flavors out like cognac and hot lava and sriracha.....so....... Brb going to buy chocolate now.
I'm a fan because this is more than just a chocolate shop. I'm in love with their guava croissant. Whether I'm near or far, there are moments that I crave their guava croissant.The shop has enough seating for a sit down, so it's convenient enough for me to grab n' go, or sit down and join the pastry with nice cup of coffee in this cute blue interior shop.I've also order from their lunch menu of refreshing beautiful salads and carefully crafted sandwiches. The owner or lead was also very nice over email communications when I placed a large catering/lunch order for my work meeting.I can't comment on the chocolate as I have been spoiled by Christopher Elbow chocolates, but this shop is more than just a chocolatier to me. It is my lquiet/quaint lunch spot as well.
This place is beautiful and so are there products but the prices are way too expensive. It should not cost $15 for an Espresso - To Go, "Happy Hour" pastry (especially when the mini one costs the same as the regular size.. and 2 mini Chocolate Bunnies.. The service was great but I will not be back to visit.
Their chocolates are so awesome! I wish they would open on weekends too. Their chocolate rich mocha is also awesome :)
Whimsical and novel flavor choices in their truffles Atmosphere is bright and clean with a polished elegance Chocolate was smooth and rich with just a hint of bitternessSome of the flavors were unnoticeable and others more forthcoming (samples are your friend) Packaging is reminiscent of something you get from Tiffany's Overall ThoughtsIf you are in need of a chocolate fix you can't go wrong with Socola
Some say the way to a girl's heart is chocolate. Not me. I don't care for chocolate unless I'm PMSing which Mr. NSS may argue that's an e-v-e-r-y-d-a-y occurrence. Have fun with PALMela and that bottle of Lubriderm, buddy!Ok. So admittedly, I may be a crazy banshee during those "trying" days but he knows the way to my heart (and how to shut me up): DURIAN, the king of fruits. Yes, that deliciously vile smell of stank feet putrefying in a mixture of cow dung, rotten eggs, and rancid fish with a sprinkling of gasoline that even Andrew Zimmern (Bizarre Foods) refuses to eat makes me giggle with excitement. If you can ignore the smell, you will be rewarded with an incredibly velvety smooth, sweet custard-like fruit with hints of vanilla, nuts, and a touch of garlic. I heard that Socola had a durian truffle flavor but was only available seasonally. Well, after a year of trying (they sell out quickly), I gave up. However, last week, I get an email from Wendy, the owner and she tells me they have the durian truffles in stock! YEEEE! She was kind enough to put a dozen aside for me and I told her I would be there during the weekend to pick it up.The next day, Mr. NSS met me at my office after work and hands me a teal gift bag. I peak inside and they're durian truffles from Socola: bit.ly/1yVJGzt! Apparently, he got on the waitlist too. Good boy!Now, I've tried many durian products and the durian smell is often subtle meaning there's very little of the real thing used. Not this time...Me *slowly devours a durian truffle* "Omg, these are so good, are you sure you don't want some?" *purposely breathes on him*Mr. NSS *moves away from me* "Good gawd, THAT smell--haven't you tortured me enough?" *tosses a vibrator from across the room and leaves*Socola durian truffles: deliciously stinky sweet P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N.
I really liked this place. They are so polite and respectful. I loved the socolatte  you should definitely try it.
12.22.14 etc.Cute chocolate and coffee shop in the SOMA hood. Inventive truffle flavors. I'm into the green tea matcha. $2.50 a piece!Quiet place for a cup of coffee as well. The socolatte comes with a piece of marshmallow!yelp.com/biz_photos/soco…
Eating the guava croissant was about as close as I will ever get to having a religious experience.
With the help of a successful Kickstarter campaign, a pair of enterprising Vietnamese-American sisters opened a boutique chocolate shop that feels like a box of chocolates, Forrest Gump-approved. It's a cute spot on a rather remote block of Folsom with very little pedestrian traffic. That's a bit of a shame since the chocolates are good even if they are somewhat premium-priced. Part of the challenge is that the chocolates, as tasty as some of them are, lack distinction, something unique that would make them memorable. As the trio of strippers sang to Louise in "Gypsy", you gottta have a gimmick if you wanna get applause.The sisters proclaim they make "artisanal confections with modern flavors and a fantastic taste of fun".OK but was I having fun? When do we get to the fun part? I came here with Jamie W. and noticed they're trying to be more than just a chocolate shop.
