Tbh, I was really unhappy when they tore down that pier building where they now have implemented benches and tables. Now, I enjoy seeing the sunset over the Bay. I enjoy how calm everything feels here. This is a good place for those who want a nice view with some peace in the busy city that is San Francisco. Just sit and talk with friends. Get a nice tan while you're at it.
Sittin' in the mornin' sun,I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comeWatchin' the ships roll in,And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah...I'm sittin' on the dock of the bayWatchin' the tide roll awayOoo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bayWastin' time...With so much effort placed on renovating the Embarcadero north of the Bay Bridge (including the installation of the Bay Lights), it seems to be taking forever and a day to see similar improvements along the waterfront to AT&T Park. Fraught with controversy over the America's Cup and the pending construction of the Warriors stadium, the area has finally seen one unmitigated improvement in the opening of the new Brannan Street Wharf. At first glance, it doesn't appear to have much to it. No shops. No clam chowder in sourdough. No Bushman. Just a long lawn along with an open walkway dotted with picnic tables and benches. A group of benches are lined up under a shade structure (photo: bit.ly/15CuXcR).I left my home in Georgia,Headed for the 'Frisco bay'Cause I've had nothing to live for,And look like nothin's gonna come my way.So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bayWatchin' the tide roll awayOoo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bayWastin' time...The most arresting feature is the trio of red elevated tidal columns with bumblebee colors that visually depict the ebb and flow of tides in order to gage the fluctuating water levels in the bay (photo: bit.ly/17s4IGD). The tops of the columns bob up and down according to the tides. There's a series of panels depicting the history of the waterfront (photo: bit.ly/19hcgPW), and you get quite a nice view of the Bay Bridge, at least for now before the stadium will likely block it out (photo: bit.ly/17MCsEP). But I m happy to read that metal skateboard-deterrent strips are installed. Bayside Market, Delancey Street Restaurant, and South Beach Cafe are all just across the Embarcadero, so you definitely have al fresco dining options available.Look like nothing's gonna change.Everything still remains the same.I can't do what ten people tell me to do,So I guess I'll remain the same, yes...Sittin' here resting my bonesAnd this loneliness won't leave me aloneIt's two thousand miles I roamedJust to make this dock my homeNow, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bayWatching the tide roll awayOooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bayWastin' time...
Great new mini park along the Embarcadero!
