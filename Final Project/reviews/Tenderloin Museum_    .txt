We did the tenderloin tour with the museum.It was awesome ! I would recommend anyone who live or arrive in San Francisco to do the tour.The guide was really nice and told us so many story about buildings, the population etc.I learned that the Cadillac hotel was the first hotel to authorize black people to stay in the city ! We also visited the St Anthony's foundation where they served 3,000 meals everyday. A really great experience.The tenderloin is a very vibrant district and so interesting !
The museum itself is rather small. I would recommend expecting to spend 30 minutes or so in the main room.The exhibit was interesting and I learned a lot about the TL's history. The tenderloin is a vibrant district in San Francisco with a storied history in both gay/queer/trans movements and tenants rights movements which continue to this day in the city. The TL also serves as SF's center of vice: brothels, gambling & dance halls, illicit theaters, jazz bars, and the like have all inhabited the TL and some continue to do so to this day.The museum needs more interactive exhibits. It's a really interesting subject, but reading a lot of placards and photos makes it hard to take it all in. A little ingenuity for the exhibit could go a long way towards making it a must-see museum in SF.
Love this place! It really highlights the liveliness and the importance of the TL in SF'S progressivism. Who knew  the TL had such a wonderful history?  I especially loved the exhibits of music, feminism,  and the LBGQ movement. So great to see dedicated folks trying to change the opinion of the TL. I'd highly recommend a visit if you're a bay area native.
2.5 StarsReally wanted to like this place but the event I went to tonight was pretty underwhelming.Attended for a mural tour and documentary short screening. It was my first time at the museum. I had been meaning to visit since I live in the neighborhood but it was pretty disappointing.First of all "museum" is a pretty generous term. The main room is lined with pretty cool photos and explanations of the history of the neighborhood. They had set it up for the documentary screening when I arrived so the main floor was chairs and a screen. Not sure what's there typically but hopefully art/objects to fill the space. It feels more like a community center and event space which would be a much better way to characterize the space and maybe even make it seem more accessible for the community.As I was waiting for the tour to start, I walked around a bit and read some of the descriptions. Everything was super interesting though I would have liked to see more black and brown faces represented.The event started around 630 (15 min late) and I left early (at 839). There wasn't food provided so I mostly left because I was hungry but I also just wasn't feeling the event/space.The walking tour itself was rushed (45 min) and didn't cover many of my favorite murals in the 'loin (along polk street). We also would stand across the street for many of them so couldn't really get up close to see the detail. We did get up close to the featured mural which they showed a documentary of later on. I would recommend that they start at 530 next time and have it be an hour and a half. Someone who is a bit more knowledgable running the tour would be helpful too. I've been on a lot of city walking tours and street art tours and this was by far the worst in terms of information, art covered, route, and presentation by the guide. **I was the only black person on the walking tour...actually, except for the guy working the door/security, I was the only black person in the TENDERLOIN museum during the event! Super problematic for obvious reasons ...**The documentary was the best part of the event and it was cool to have both the filmmaker and the muralist there. The documentary actually captured the diversity of the TL--unlike the homogeneity of the museum staff and participants in the tour. I REALLY hope other events have people from the neighborhood represented.The gift shop is the entire first room/foyer reception. The t-shirts with street names and the tote with TL quote would make great gifts. I was surprised that the gift shop was pretty reasonably priced. I would return and get a "Hyde" or "Ellis" shirt.Didn't get too many photos of the art on the tour but the sunset was spectacular! I was considering joining as a member because I live a few blocks away but tonight's event pretty much squashed that idea. Hope to support future events showcasing the diversity of the neighborhood and see this place blossom into a place that's more welcoming and "of" the nabe.
I checked out the new museum on Sunday 7/26/15 since I had time.  It's close to Civic Center Bart.  I walked up Leavensworth and it's on the corner of Eddy & Leavensworth.Museum price is $10; if you want museum & walking tour it's $15.  I did the $15 museum & walking tour on Sun 2pm.  Phone isn't working, so had to go in to find out about time for walking tour.Photos allowed.Museum is in one big room, lots of things to read, there's some videos, and listening stations to hear music.  There is one pinball machine that works for FREE, but no paddles on the sides, you just shake the whole machine on it's side if you can.  I couldn't stop the ball from going in the middle.Walking tour was just ok for me, I guess more history of different places would be good.  Small area in the main lobby where you can buy t-shirts, book, mug, & postcards.Separate bathrooms available and drinking fountains.Hrs:Closed MondaysTues-Sun 10-5
Getting to the Tenderloin Museum is going to be something folks will talk about back home---whether they hike up the three blocks from Market, or down from Geary---it's a colorful stroll.  Lots of Local Color.  And the museum offers tours twice daily, if you actually want to meet some of that color.  The museum itself is smallish, and most of what it has on display is on the walls, in chronological and counterclockwise order, beginning with the aftermath of the great 1906 quake and fire that led to the creation of the district as we know it.  Photos are in some cases supplemented with video displays, but the floor is mostly empty (check out the ceiling though!) and the place is remarkably light on artifacts.  Aren't there any old signs or other vestiges of the area's history?  Anywhere?  San Francisco has changed a lot, it's a lot cleaner than it was, when it comes to vice.  Just one Herb Caen quote shows how widespread gambling was.  And yet, given our liberal image, the leadership comes across as stodgy at best, damn well draconian at worst---like a bunch of New England prudes at times.  Men and women are dancing!  Together!  Lions and Tigers and Bears!  Oh my!I'd recommend checking out "Screaming Queens" on YouTube as it will flesh out the transsexual part of the display, and add some very good visuals to Compton's Cafeteria, where they fought back against the police, before Stonewall did it more famously.  I'd also recommend the website Up From The Deep, which has a photo history of the district---every building!What comes across though is how vibrant the area once was.  Today so much of the Tenderloin is boarded up, walled off, stuccoed over, with murals standing in for Life on windows no longer open for business.  Much of this can be blamed on charities like Oshun, which occupies the former Compton's Space, turning a once vibrant corner into a dead zone.  The TL needs these store fronts to be returned to commercial use so the district can have a chance at reviving.Ultimately, one wonders if $10 admission is going to fly.  Kids, seniors, the disabled get in for $6, so a family of four would be $32.  the cost of one ticket to the Exploratorium, but the Exploratorium also offers much more punch for the buck.  On the other hand, after making that hike, a lot of people will probably fork over the money just to get inside, away from all that lurks on the streets!I'd recommend it though.  While there's plenty of room to grow, what exists now is certainly informative.
The Tenderloin Museum, in its current state, amounts to a great start. The museum comprises two rooms, one of which is a gift shop (I might go back and pick up a Tenderloin poster), but the proprietors seem self-aware, a fact made clear by the giant wall dedicated to museum-goer suggestions for how to improve the experience. One commenter had some sound recommendations, one of which was to make the space more three-dimensional by integrating more audiovisual elements---my guess is that cost is a major impediment to this improvement at this state. Another commenter complained that the price of admission ($10 for adults, $6 for students) is too high for most Tenderloin residents to visit. I'd propose a Tenderloin resident rate of $5.That said, the museum does a good job of telling a compelling story about this historic neighborhood. The context of the modern Tenderloin makes more sense after visiting this place, and I am hopeful that the exhibit will continue to grow and expand. I will definitely be taking friends visiting the city to this unique place.
Went in with a friend just out of pure curiosity and left satisfied!
Great museum! Plenty to read and learn about Old San Francisco. Nice retail products as well. The staff is very friendly and I look forward to a walking tour next time. There are videos to watch and listening stations.
As far as museums go thus one is far from the best. I like history museums but this was underwhelming and a quarter if the place is the gift $hop. The Tenderloin Museum tells the story of the good, the bad and the ugly of the neighborhood without much proof. It's a very digital experience fir a really non digital area. There should be a map of all the sights and places that are talked about so the interested can go check them out in person, maybe provide a walking map of the places if interest that are or even no longer there. Lastly the space seems so sterile in contrast to the moment you step back onto Leavenworth street and are hit with that piss and sh*t aroma and offered some snack by the savvy dealers who want to give visitors s more authentic experience if the TL.
The SF Tenderloin Museum is well worth visiting.  There are many fascinating photos and materials about the history of the area and its current transformation, including support services for the homeless and struggling young immigrant families.  The staff is very friendly and will answer questions in depth.  Also worthwhile is the Tenderloin tour offered by the museum.  The 1-hr tour and museum admission together is only $15 ($5 discount).  Our guide gave us an in-depth tour and pointed out many famous buildings (e.g. Glide Memorial Church, film and recording studios, public garages, etc, etc.of the past) and various agencies currently offering support for the homeless as well as low-income residents.  Highly recommended!
I went here to watch a documentary on homelessness in the Tenderloin. I was impressed that the place had only been open a few months. They had free hors d'oeuvres, which were ample in portion and variety. The documentary screening took place in their main room (the museum proper) and was rather good. I highly recommend folks check out this particular film, and I'll be going back this week for their screening of "Drugs in the Tenderloin".

Who knew  the TL had such a wonderful history?  I especially loved the exhibits of music, feminism,  and the LBGQ movement. So great to see dedicated folks trying to change the opinion of the TL. I'd highly recommend a visit if you're a bay area native.
2.5 StarsReally wanted to like this place but the event I went to tonight was pretty underwhelming.Attended for a mural tour and documentary short screening. It was my first time at the museum. I had been meaning to visit since I live in the neighborhood but it was pretty disappointing.First of all "museum" is a pretty generous term. The main room is lined with pretty cool photos and explanations of the history of the neighborhood. They had set it up for the documentary screening when I arrived so the main floor was chairs and a screen. Not sure what's there typically but hopefully art/objects to fill the space. It feels more like a community center and event space which would be a much better way to characterize the space and maybe even make it seem more accessible for the community.As I was waiting for the tour to start, I walked around a bit and read some of the descriptions. Everything was super interesting though I would have liked to see more black and brown faces represented.The event started around 630 (15 min late) and I left early (at 839). There wasn't food provided so I mostly left because I was hungry but I also just wasn't feeling the event/space.The walking tour itself was rushed (45 min) and didn't cover many of my favorite murals in the 'loin (along polk street). We also would stand across the street for many of them so couldn't really get up close to see the detail. We did get up close to the featured mural which they showed a documentary of later on. I would recommend that they start at 530 next time and have it be an hour and a half. Someone who is a bit more knowledgable running the tour would be helpful too. I've been on a lot of city walking tours and street art tours and this was by far the worst in terms of information, art covered, route, and presentation by the guide. **I was the only black person on the walking tour...actually, except for the guy working the door/security, I was the only black person in the TENDERLOIN museum during the event! Super problematic for obvious reasons ...**The documentary was the best part of the event and it was cool to have both the filmmaker and the muralist there. The documentary actually captured the diversity of the TL--unlike the homogeneity of the museum staff and participants in the tour. I REALLY hope other events have people from the neighborhood represented.The gift shop is the entire first room/foyer reception. The t-shirts with street names and the tote with TL quote would make great gifts. I was surprised that the gift shop was pretty reasonably priced. I would return and get a "Hyde" or "Ellis" shirt.Didn't get too many photos of the art on the tour but the sunset was spectacular! I was considering joining as a member because I live a few blocks away but tonight's event pretty much squashed that idea. Hope to support future events showcasing the diversity of the neighborhood and see this place blossom into a place that's more welcoming and "of" the nabe.
I checked out the new museum on Sunday 7/26/15 since I had time.  It's close to Civic Center Bart.  I walked up Leavensworth and it's on the corner of Eddy & Leavensworth.Museum price is $10; if you want museum & walking tour it's $15.  I did the $15 museum & walking tour on Sun 2pm.  Phone isn't working, so had to go in to find out about time for walking tour.Photos allowed.Museum is in one big room, lots of things to read, there's some videos, and listening stations to hear music.  There is one pinball machine that works for FREE, but no paddles on the sides, you just shake the whole machine on it's side if you can.  I couldn't stop the ball from going in the middle.Walking tour was just ok for me, I guess more history of different places would be good.  Small area in the main lobby where you can buy t-shirts, book, mug, & postcards.Separate bathrooms available and drinking fountains.Hrs:Closed MondaysTues-Sun 10-5
Getting to the Tenderloin Museum is going to be something folks will talk about back home---whether they hike up the three blocks from Market, or down from Geary---it's a colorful stroll.  Lots of Local Color.  And the museum offers tours twice daily, if you actually want to meet some of that color.  The museum itself is smallish, and most of what it has on display is on the walls, in chronological and counterclockwise order, beginning with the aftermath of the great 1906 quake and fire that led to the creation of the district as we know it.  Photos are in some cases supplemented with video displays, but the floor is mostly empty (check out the ceiling though!) and the place is remarkably light on artifacts.  Aren't there any old signs or other vestiges of the area's history?  Anywhere?  San Francisco has changed a lot, it's a lot cleaner than it was, when it comes to vice.  Just one Herb Caen quote shows how widespread gambling was.  And yet, given our liberal image, the leadership comes across as stodgy at best, damn well draconian at worst---like a bunch of New England prudes at times.  Men and women are dancing!  Together!  Lions and Tigers and Bears!  Oh my!I'd recommend checking out "Screaming Queens" on YouTube as it will flesh out the transsexual part of the display, and add some very good visuals to Compton's Cafeteria, where they fought back against the police, before Stonewall did it more famously.  I'd also recommend the website Up From The Deep, which has a photo history of the district---every building!What comes across though is how vibrant the area once was.  Today so much of the Tenderloin is boarded up, walled off, stuccoed over, with murals standing in for Life on windows no longer open for business.  Much of this can be blamed on charities like Oshun, which occupies the former Compton's Space, turning a once vibrant corner into a dead zone.  The TL needs these store fronts to be returned to commercial use so the district can have a chance at reviving.Ultimately, one wonders if $10 admission is going to fly.  Kids, seniors, the disabled get in for $6, so a family of four would be $32.  the cost of one ticket to the Exploratorium, but the Exploratorium also offers much more punch for the buck.  On the other hand, after making that hike, a lot of people will probably fork over the money just to get inside, away from all that lurks on the streets!I'd recommend it though.  While there's plenty of room to grow, what exists now is certainly informative.
The Tenderloin Museum, in its current state, amounts to a great start. The museum comprises two rooms, one of which is a gift shop (I might go back and pick up a Tenderloin poster), but the proprietors seem self-aware, a fact made clear by the giant wall dedicated to museum-goer suggestions for how to improve the experience. One commenter had some sound recommendations, one of which was to make the space more three-dimensional by integrating more audiovisual elements---my guess is that cost is a major impediment to this improvement at this state. Another commenter complained that the price of admission ($10 for adults, $6 for students) is too high for most Tenderloin residents to visit. I'd propose a Tenderloin resident rate of $5.That said, the museum does a good job of telling a compelling story about this historic neighborhood. The context of the modern Tenderloin makes more sense after visiting this place, and I am hopeful that the exhibit will continue to grow and expand. I will definitely be taking friends visiting the city to this unique place.
Went in with a friend just out of pure curiosity and left satisfied!
Great museum! Plenty to read and learn about Old San Francisco. Nice retail products as well. The staff is very friendly and I look forward to a walking tour next time. There are videos to watch and listening stations.
As far as museums go thus one is far from the best. I like history museums but this was underwhelming and a quarter if the place is the gift $hop. The Tenderloin Museum tells the story of the good, the bad and the ugly of the neighborhood without much proof. It's a very digital experience fir a really non digital area. There should be a map of all the sights and places that are talked about so the interested can go check them out in person, maybe provide a walking map of the places if interest that are or even no longer there. Lastly the space seems so sterile in contrast to the moment you step back onto Leavenworth street and are hit with that piss and sh*t aroma and offered some snack by the savvy dealers who want to give visitors s more authentic experience if the TL.
The SF Tenderloin Museum is well worth visiting.  There are many fascinating photos and materials about the history of the area and its current transformation, including support services for the homeless and struggling young immigrant families.  The staff is very friendly and will answer questions in depth.  Also worthwhile is the Tenderloin tour offered by the museum.  The 1-hr tour and museum admission together is only $15 ($5 discount).  Our guide gave us an in-depth tour and pointed out many famous buildings (e.g. Glide Memorial Church, film and recording studios, public garages, etc, etc.of the past) and various agencies currently offering support for the homeless as well as low-income residents.  Highly recommended!
I went here to watch a documentary on homelessness in the Tenderloin. I was impressed that the place had only been open a few months. They had free hors d'oeuvres, which were ample in portion and variety. The documentary screening took place in their main room (the museum proper) and was rather good. I highly recommend folks check out this particular film, and I'll be going back this week for their screening of "Drugs in the Tenderloin".
