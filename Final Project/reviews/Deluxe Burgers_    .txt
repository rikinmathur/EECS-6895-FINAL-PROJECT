I'm sure this place gets tons of great reviews on its Burgers, but can we talk about the fries for a minute?!I am so particular about my fries--matchstick, crispy, flaky, salty, deep fried. You name it and I have a critique for how fries should be cooked. Pearls has some of the best fries hands down. There fries are just as good as their burgers if not I dare say better. That would be a very tough call to make though, so I will leave it to a more expertise person. Also, I might add the owner is just a great guy! You can see how passionate he is about his business and the care he puts into it for it to succeed. The very first time I order at Pearls he very casually told me about their new app and abilities to pay online to save me from having to use the ATM again. And kudos to him for seeing a need and meeting the demand. Placing an online is such convenience saves me from the $2.50 service fee I would have from using the ATM. Every time I have gone to Pearl's I am attended to right away, even if the register clerk is busy. I never wait long for food and treated as a valued customer. I love seeing business like Pearls thrive!
Great burgers, great fries, great everything!I came here when I was looking for great American food on Google Maps around downtown San Francisco. Google said it would be crowded but I was lucky. Just after me a bunch of people arrived. Little off the spot, few seats. I ordered the Prized Pearl Burger (blue cheese, bacon, grilled onions) with Springs (half onion rings - best of my life -, half sweet potatoe fries). Patty was just as I wanted it (medium rare), Springs were enough for two. Best of all: free refills on Ginger Ale!I only can recommend this place, waiting is worthwhile! Would come back anytime. Pre-orders for take away available online. Cash only!!
This place serves the kind of burgers that makes an atheist say grace. These burgers are so panty-dropping good, I feel like I need a cigarette after eating one. Not just the burgers though, the garlic fries + onion rings combo (Garlic Frings) are so insanely perfect in both texture, and flavor, I pretty much always eat until I'm too full when I come here.Treat yourself.Do the right thing.Eat at Pearl's.
I wouldn't say anything I tried punched my mouth with the WOW factor, but Pearl's is unique as a burger joint.Pearl's has Carl's Jr size burgers, without the fast food behind it. The menu is large with a great amount of variety. From turkey, beef, kobe beef, and buffalo for your meat options, to salads, hot dogs, fries, onion rings and shakes. One good thing about the place is that you can get your meat cooked anyway you want it. Medium rare or anything lower if you dare is how I would suggest your meat be cooked. The buns they use tend to get dry towards the end, so all the juice you can get helps a lot as you try and devour the large size monster.Small spot, with only 3 tables and window seating. Cash only.
Amazing burgers at cheap prices!I love this place for a few reasons:- They give generous and legit quality meat cooked to your specifications- It's very affordable - their burgers are $8.99 and under (unless you go for buffalo or Kobe)- It's no frills and thus has a welcoming/accessible vibeI'd recommend the Phat Bob (bacon, onion rings, BBQ sauce, jack cheese, and mayo) - fantastic. You should also try their frings (fries + onion rings) - they must double fry these because they are sooo crispy and satisfying.If you want something simple, their mini deluxe with cheese and bacon really hits the spot and it's $6.49!
Let's start off by saying we were suggested this place since we're from out of town. We had a big group with us and like most restaurants in San Francisco they are rather compact. We waited for about 10 minutes to put tables and chairs together to accommodate everyone.  We ordered in the meantime and I was excited that everyone got something different (I like to share and try to get a bite of everyone's plate) Staff was very friendly and patient with us since we had a big group, he also even made a couple recommendations. Once we all had our food everyone was satisfied and happy with their order. Hope you enjoy, check out my foodie page @foodgurula
Solid burgers and solid service. My only complaint is that our burgers weren't medium rare as requested, more so on the well done side but were still juicy anyways so wasn't a big deal.Prices seem a little more than fair considering they are within the same range as most non chain burgers and they're generous with their portions. Their french fries are boomb too. Nice and crispy, not sure what's coating the outside but it adds for a nice extra crunchy texture. My boyfriend loved them (= The portions on fries are enough for two to share and then some.Would definitely be down to come back, they have a pretty tempting list of milkshakes I'd like to try.
Small business but the quality will surprise you. They menu is quit big and they recommend you to order the meat. That's what they're well known for.Since I had a lot of meat throughout Thanksgiving I felt like eating more healthy.The vegetarian burger was delicious and somehow it tasted like meat.
Of course, Pearl's is a legend. Their burgers are supreme. I do love how they have an option for mini-burgers. The big ones are too big!They surely are famous for their burgers, but their friiiiiiieeeees tho. Fries are often an oversight. Many of my favorite burger places have mediocre fries. It's a shame. But I'd say that Pearl's has some of the best fries I've ever had.The only bummer is that they are cash only, however they do have an ATM inside. The cash only thing has proven to be quite a hindrance on many occasions.
Where have you been all my life? I think this place has the best burger I ever had. Everything was perfect. The burger, the onion rings, the coke. I salivate a little just thinking about my meal as I write this review. The prices are fair and you get a lot of food. I think this place may have ruined other burgers for me.Parking is pretty difficult in this area. I must have circled around about 5 times before I finally found a spot. And there aren't a lot of seating areas inside the restaurant so you have to awkwardly wait around for someone to finish their meal before you snag their chairs.
Food came out pretty fast. We were helped by the owner who apparently had no clue he was ranked #17 out of 5000 according to trip advisor. Pretty good. For the two of us it was $23 for two burgers and fries. Good burger, for sure.
If you want a good quality meat burger this is the place! However the place itself is a bit crowded and small so seating would be a pain if it was busy. The customer service was great however when I asked the girl about the Kobe beef it seemed like she was reading something off the wall which I thought was pretty hilarious. The first thing I noticed was the big container of pickles!! I love pickles and they just have it by where they keep the condiments so basically it was all you can eat pickles. That's a huge bonus for me already!I got the spicysly burger with Kobe beef. Love how you can tell them how you want to cook your burger! Most places don't really do that so another bonus point for Pearl's! I got my burger rare and it was deliiish. The meat itself was so juicy and tender and had lots of flavor. I definitely recommend upgrading to the Kobe because the meat was just so tender! The components on the burger really worked well too. The only thing is that this burger was super messy. Everything kept falling out and it was just too hard to eat so I ended up using a fork but still good. I also ordered the fries, the half regular and half onion rings. They were super crispy and tasty. The only thing is there was barely any onion rings... They probably used it all in their burger because there was barely any in our basket :( but in our burgers oh man there was a lot! Overall I think this place deserves to be eaten at least once. Simple burgers with great taste and pizazz!
I don't know. The burger was just OK. Nothing spectacular. We got the chili cheese fries and the pearls deluxe with cheese. The food was all just very average. But! There's free pickles. We liked the pickles lol.
I love revisiting old places I haven't reviewed in a long time.  I can't believe after going to Pearl's two times in two months, that my next visit wouldn't be for another 4 years.  I stopped by for lunch after a movie at AMC Van Ness and had a good craving for a Mushroom Cheeseburger, so that's what I ordered on my return visit.Deluxe Burger with Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and grilled onions w/ side of fries. -- bit.ly/1MUXMLhOh my lord!!  One thing I didn't remember was how huge these burgers were at Pearl's.  The bun is great, the onions and mushrooms were sauteed well, and the beef patty was cooked perfectly.  It definitely satisfied my mushroom burger craving!  And the fries, I definitely remember how much I loved the fries and they are still awesome!  They're double fried and have a nice seasoned crust to them.I must've gone to Pearl's at the right time because when I arrived there it was near empty.  However, by the time I had finished my meal, there was a line out the door and a bunch of folks standing around waiting for a table to open up.  That just goes to show that even though they've been around the block for a while, Pearl's Deluxe is still a popular burger joint.  Stop by if you haven't been there yet or haven't gone back in a while like me.  They haven't lost their touch!
Pearlie Kobe Burger and Homemade Chili!Some of the best sweet potato fries I have had!~The RestaurantThe restaurant is tiny. Hospitality is Large! The customers were annoying. There is a hostile across the street and I think a mob of people staying there decided to come right before us. There are a few tables and some bar style seating. The place is cash only and there are large signs stating this. Despite the signs, customer after customer was making a big ordeal out of it. There is an ATM inside. I had my cash ready and just kept getting annoyed at the customers who were not ready. The group ahead of us was gobbling down the free dill pickles. The guy had to refill the container. I saw a lady even put some in a baggy.~Food- 4 StarsEverything here is about the same price (under $10). What costs extra is when you start customizing. I had the Kobe Burger with Homemade Chili and Avocado. It was pretty good. I think I would order it with the chili on the side next time.They also have kids size portions including a burger with cheese. Sweet Potato Fries stole the show. We ate these and even stopped by a second time to order a bag of these to go.~Prices- 4 Stars!Very reasonable.~Parking-?We walked here. It looks like parking is pretty easy on the street.Overall, I am a fan! Thanks Pearl!
The only reason why I gave this 4 stars as they don't accept cards else awsome burgers at reasonable price!
Cash Only! ATM on site.This is my go to burger spot. Conveniently  (dangerously) located near my apartment, I can order to go and still come home to a warm burger and crunchy fries. Owner is super friendly and accomodating, as well as the staff. I have yet to be disappointed in any of their menu items. Their garlic fries are to die for...meaty, crunchy fries with a mountain of garlic...YUM. Burgers are cooked to perfection and a plethora of milkshakes to choose from. Do your taste buds a favor and eat here!
[Cash only alert!] Yes, yes, yes and more yes.  I finally found an awesome burger joint in my neighborhood!  This one's a keeper folks ;) If you're vegetarian, they offer a veggie burger OR you can ask them to substitute a veggie burger in any of their "special" burger menu items.  I did the latter, and ordered a BBQ veggie burger.  My friend and I split garlic fries and onion rings.  Everything was good, but the star of the meal for me was the burger - just a really great veggie burger.  The garlic fries were also quite solid, and the onion rings were good but I tend to prefer meaty onions with lots of batter - theirs were lighter, which some may actually prefer.  Last thing I thought was awesome was the service - the employees were clearly happy to be there and provided awesome service.  Seriously, go try this restaurant - it's fantastic.  But beware, CASH ONLY!
Huge fan of this place and highly recommend it. It's a tiny spot, but very clean and very good customer service. I walk by here on my way home from work everyday so my bf and I decided to try it. Their burgers was made to order and they have a good variety from beef patties to grilled chicken, as well as good choice of other topics such as bacon and different kinds of cheese. I got their deluxe cheeseburger (medium rare) with cheddar cheese with fries and it was very juicy and tasty. I especially like their friessssss -- great flavor! I'll definitely be back again to try their other burgers.
I feel I paid a grip for this!  Yes the burgers are huge, but sometimes you just can't enjoy it in that fashion.  + Things to note +That frontage photo either is of a different Pearl location, or this one moved two stores down.  I expected it in the corner, yet it wasn't there.  + Dining and menu board +The place is fairly small and can get pretty packed.  As I stood in a long line, and in front of the fridge with sodas, I wasn't sure if people were stealing free drinks because it was crowded.  Or if they had actually paid for them and grabbed it after the fact.  Who knows?  But that's how packed it was.  The menu board was handy:  Burgers listed at $6.99 to $14.99, from Turkey to  Buffalo, respectively.  Sides and milkshakes also listed.+ Service +The girl was cute, so no issue.  She gave good recommendations too!  The manager was also cool.  He sweatily hustled and served orders, made milkshakes, helped the cashier, etc.  ++ Sides ++We tried the Springs (1/2 sweet potato fries 1/2 onion rings, $5.99):  It was ok, but kind of flimsy.  I enjoyed a few and couldn't finish it.  They served a lot!  The onion rings were crunchy, but didn't satisfy my craving for it.  Kinda weak in my opinion.  Wish I tried the regular fries.  ++ Beefy Burgers ++~ Pearl Deluxe with cheedar cheese ($7.99):  The bun was nice and buttery on the inside, and the patty was real beefy.  I ordered it medium rare and expected a lot of juiciness, but didn't get it.  Overall, not a bad choice.~ Kobe Burger with jack cheese ($13.49):  This was bigger than the Pearl Deluxe!  The burger and all it's fixings were freakin' huge.  Like I previously mentioned and at first glance, "sometimes you just can't enjoy it in that fashion".  Plus big bites of a dry bun aren't fun.  The kobe patty itself was like a steak, yet leaner.  It's what I expected.  Loved the patty, medium-rare as well.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  Stick with a Pearl Deluxe.  ++ Overall impression ++   Wasn't too impressed really.  I did enjoy the free chocolate shake I was given, since no one claimed it, so the manager gave it to me.  Bonus star for being nice, even though I saw him insert the straw tip down with his index finger, eek.  The Oreo cookie shake was yummerz too!  A soothing mix to help push that kobe beef down.  ~ Was I stuffed?  Yes!  ~ Was it worth $35?  Not in my opinion.  Sorry fellow yelpers!~ Would I come back?  Maybe.  I give second chances sometimes.

Amazing burgers at cheap prices!I love this place for a few reasons:- They give generous and legit quality meat cooked to your specifications- It's very affordable - their burgers are $8.99 and under (unless you go for buffalo or Kobe)- It's no frills and thus has a welcoming/accessible vibeI'd recommend the Phat Bob (bacon, onion rings, BBQ sauce, jack cheese, and mayo) - fantastic. You should also try their frings (fries + onion rings) - they must double fry these because they are sooo crispy and satisfying.If you want something simple, their mini deluxe with cheese and bacon really hits the spot and it's $6.49!
Let's start off by saying we were suggested this place since we're from out of town. We had a big group with us and like most restaurants in San Francisco they are rather compact. We waited for about 10 minutes to put tables and chairs together to accommodate everyone.  We ordered in the meantime and I was excited that everyone got something different (I like to share and try to get a bite of everyone's plate) Staff was very friendly and patient with us since we had a big group, he also even made a couple recommendations. Once we all had our food everyone was satisfied and happy with their order. Hope you enjoy, check out my foodie page @foodgurula
Solid burgers and solid service. My only complaint is that our burgers weren't medium rare as requested, more so on the well done side but were still juicy anyways so wasn't a big deal.Prices seem a little more than fair considering they are within the same range as most non chain burgers and they're generous with their portions. Their french fries are boomb too. Nice and crispy, not sure what's coating the outside but it adds for a nice extra crunchy texture. My boyfriend loved them (= The portions on fries are enough for two to share and then some.Would definitely be down to come back, they have a pretty tempting list of milkshakes I'd like to try.
Small business but the quality will surprise you. They menu is quit big and they recommend you to order the meat. That's what they're well known for.Since I had a lot of meat throughout Thanksgiving I felt like eating more healthy.The vegetarian burger was delicious and somehow it tasted like meat.
Of course, Pearl's is a legend. Their burgers are supreme. I do love how they have an option for mini-burgers. The big ones are too big!They surely are famous for their burgers, but their friiiiiiieeeees tho. Fries are often an oversight. Many of my favorite burger places have mediocre fries. It's a shame. But I'd say that Pearl's has some of the best fries I've ever had.The only bummer is that they are cash only, however they do have an ATM inside. The cash only thing has proven to be quite a hindrance on many occasions.
Where have you been all my life? I think this place has the best burger I ever had. Everything was perfect. The burger, the onion rings, the coke. I salivate a little just thinking about my meal as I write this review. The prices are fair and you get a lot of food. I think this place may have ruined other burgers for me.Parking is pretty difficult in this area. I must have circled around about 5 times before I finally found a spot. And there aren't a lot of seating areas inside the restaurant so you have to awkwardly wait around for someone to finish their meal before you snag their chairs.
Food came out pretty fast. We were helped by the owner who apparently had no clue he was ranked #17 out of 5000 according to trip advisor. Pretty good. For the two of us it was $23 for two burgers and fries. Good burger, for sure.
If you want a good quality meat burger this is the place! However the place itself is a bit crowded and small so seating would be a pain if it was busy. The customer service was great however when I asked the girl about the Kobe beef it seemed like she was reading something off the wall which I thought was pretty hilarious. The first thing I noticed was the big container of pickles!! I love pickles and they just have it by where they keep the condiments so basically it was all you can eat pickles. That's a huge bonus for me already!I got the spicysly burger with Kobe beef. Love how you can tell them how you want to cook your burger! Most places don't really do that so another bonus point for Pearl's! I got my burger rare and it was deliiish. The meat itself was so juicy and tender and had lots of flavor. I definitely recommend upgrading to the Kobe because the meat was just so tender! The components on the burger really worked well too. The only thing is that this burger was super messy. Everything kept falling out and it was just too hard to eat so I ended up using a fork but still good. I also ordered the fries, the half regular and half onion rings. They were super crispy and tasty. The only thing is there was barely any onion rings... They probably used it all in their burger because there was barely any in our basket :( but in our burgers oh man there was a lot! Overall I think this place deserves to be eaten at least once. Simple burgers with great taste and pizazz!
I don't know. The burger was just OK. Nothing spectacular. We got the chili cheese fries and the pearls deluxe with cheese. The food was all just very average. But! There's free pickles. We liked the pickles lol.
I love revisiting old places I haven't reviewed in a long time.  I can't believe after going to Pearl's two times in two months, that my next visit wouldn't be for another 4 years.  I stopped by for lunch after a movie at AMC Van Ness and had a good craving for a Mushroom Cheeseburger, so that's what I ordered on my return visit.Deluxe Burger with Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and grilled onions w/ side of fries. -- bit.ly/1MUXMLhOh my lord!!  One thing I didn't remember was how huge these burgers were at Pearl's.  The bun is great, the onions and mushrooms were sauteed well, and the beef patty was cooked perfectly.  It definitely satisfied my mushroom burger craving!  And the fries, I definitely remember how much I loved the fries and they are still awesome!  They're double fried and have a nice seasoned crust to them.I must've gone to Pearl's at the right time because when I arrived there it was near empty.  However, by the time I had finished my meal, there was a line out the door and a bunch of folks standing around waiting for a table to open up.  That just goes to show that even though they've been around the block for a while, Pearl's Deluxe is still a popular burger joint.  Stop by if you haven't been there yet or haven't gone back in a while like me.  They haven't lost their touch!
Pearlie Kobe Burger and Homemade Chili!Some of the best sweet potato fries I have had!~The RestaurantThe restaurant is tiny. Hospitality is Large! The customers were annoying. There is a hostile across the street and I think a mob of people staying there decided to come right before us. There are a few tables and some bar style seating. The place is cash only and there are large signs stating this. Despite the signs, customer after customer was making a big ordeal out of it. There is an ATM inside. I had my cash ready and just kept getting annoyed at the customers who were not ready. The group ahead of us was gobbling down the free dill pickles. The guy had to refill the container. I saw a lady even put some in a baggy.~Food- 4 StarsEverything here is about the same price (under $10). What costs extra is when you start customizing. I had the Kobe Burger with Homemade Chili and Avocado. It was pretty good. I think I would order it with the chili on the side next time.They also have kids size portions including a burger with cheese. Sweet Potato Fries stole the show. We ate these and even stopped by a second time to order a bag of these to go.~Prices- 4 Stars!Very reasonable.~Parking-?We walked here. It looks like parking is pretty easy on the street.Overall, I am a fan! Thanks Pearl!
The only reason why I gave this 4 stars as they don't accept cards else awsome burgers at reasonable price!
Cash Only! ATM on site.This is my go to burger spot. Conveniently  (dangerously) located near my apartment, I can order to go and still come home to a warm burger and crunchy fries. Owner is super friendly and accomodating, as well as the staff. I have yet to be disappointed in any of their menu items. Their garlic fries are to die for...meaty, crunchy fries with a mountain of garlic...YUM. Burgers are cooked to perfection and a plethora of milkshakes to choose from. Do your taste buds a favor and eat here!
[Cash only alert!] Yes, yes, yes and more yes.  I finally found an awesome burger joint in my neighborhood!  This one's a keeper folks ;) If you're vegetarian, they offer a veggie burger OR you can ask them to substitute a veggie burger in any of their "special" burger menu items.  I did the latter, and ordered a BBQ veggie burger.  My friend and I split garlic fries and onion rings.  Everything was good, but the star of the meal for me was the burger - just a really great veggie burger.  The garlic fries were also quite solid, and the onion rings were good but I tend to prefer meaty onions with lots of batter - theirs were lighter, which some may actually prefer.  Last thing I thought was awesome was the service - the employees were clearly happy to be there and provided awesome service.  Seriously, go try this restaurant - it's fantastic.  But beware, CASH ONLY!
Huge fan of this place and highly recommend it. It's a tiny spot, but very clean and very good customer service. I walk by here on my way home from work everyday so my bf and I decided to try it. Their burgers was made to order and they have a good variety from beef patties to grilled chicken, as well as good choice of other topics such as bacon and different kinds of cheese. I got their deluxe cheeseburger (medium rare) with cheddar cheese with fries and it was very juicy and tasty. I especially like their friessssss -- great flavor! I'll definitely be back again to try their other burgers.
I feel I paid a grip for this!  Yes the burgers are huge, but sometimes you just can't enjoy it in that fashion.  + Things to note +That frontage photo either is of a different Pearl location, or this one moved two stores down.  I expected it in the corner, yet it wasn't there.  + Dining and menu board +The place is fairly small and can get pretty packed.  As I stood in a long line, and in front of the fridge with sodas, I wasn't sure if people were stealing free drinks because it was crowded.  Or if they had actually paid for them and grabbed it after the fact.  Who knows?  But that's how packed it was.  The menu board was handy:  Burgers listed at $6.99 to $14.99, from Turkey to  Buffalo, respectively.  Sides and milkshakes also listed.+ Service +The girl was cute, so no issue.  She gave good recommendations too!  The manager was also cool.  He sweatily hustled and served orders, made milkshakes, helped the cashier, etc.  ++ Sides ++We tried the Springs (1/2 sweet potato fries 1/2 onion rings, $5.99):  It was ok, but kind of flimsy.  I enjoyed a few and couldn't finish it.  They served a lot!  The onion rings were crunchy, but didn't satisfy my craving for it.  Kinda weak in my opinion.  Wish I tried the regular fries.  ++ Beefy Burgers ++~ Pearl Deluxe with cheedar cheese ($7.99):  The bun was nice and buttery on the inside, and the patty was real beefy.  I ordered it medium rare and expected a lot of juiciness, but didn't get it.  Overall, not a bad choice.~ Kobe Burger with jack cheese ($13.49):  This was bigger than the Pearl Deluxe!  The burger and all it's fixings were freakin' huge.  Like I previously mentioned and at first glance, "sometimes you just can't enjoy it in that fashion".  Plus big bites of a dry bun aren't fun.  The kobe patty itself was like a steak, yet leaner.  It's what I expected.  Loved the patty, medium-rare as well.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  Stick with a Pearl Deluxe.  ++ Overall impression ++   Wasn't too impressed really.  I did enjoy the free chocolate shake I was given, since no one claimed it, so the manager gave it to me.  Bonus star for being nice, even though I saw him insert the straw tip down with his index finger, eek.  The Oreo cookie shake was yummerz too!  A soothing mix to help push that kobe beef down.  ~ Was I stuffed?  Yes!  ~ Was it worth $35?  Not in my opinion.  Sorry fellow yelpers!~ Would I come back?  Maybe.  I give second chances sometimes.
I'm sure this place gets tons of great reviews on its Burgers, but can we talk about the fries for a minute?!I am so particular about my fries--matchstick, crispy, flaky, salty, deep fried. You name it and I have a critique for how fries should be cooked. Pearls has some of the best fries hands down. There fries are just as good as their burgers if not I dare say better. That would be a very tough call to make though, so I will leave it to a more expertise person. Also, I might add the owner is just a great guy! You can see how passionate he is about his business and the care he puts into it for it to succeed. The very first time I order at Pearls he very casually told me about their new app and abilities to pay online to save me from having to use the ATM again. And kudos to him for seeing a need and meeting the demand. Placing an online is such convenience saves me from the $2.50 service fee I would have from using the ATM. Every time I have gone to Pearl's I am attended to right away, even if the register clerk is busy. I never wait long for food and treated as a valued customer. I love seeing business like Pearls thrive!
Great burgers, great fries, great everything!I came here when I was looking for great American food on Google Maps around downtown San Francisco. Google said it would be crowded but I was lucky. Just after me a bunch of people arrived. Little off the spot, few seats. I ordered the Prized Pearl Burger (blue cheese, bacon, grilled onions) with Springs (half onion rings - best of my life -, half sweet potatoe fries). Patty was just as I wanted it (medium rare), Springs were enough for two. Best of all: free refills on Ginger Ale!I only can recommend this place, waiting is worthwhile! Would come back anytime. Pre-orders for take away available online. Cash only!!
This place serves the kind of burgers that makes an atheist say grace. These burgers are so panty-dropping good, I feel like I need a cigarette after eating one. Not just the burgers though, the garlic fries + onion rings combo (Garlic Frings) are so insanely perfect in both texture, and flavor, I pretty much always eat until I'm too full when I come here.Treat yourself.Do the right thing.Eat at Pearl's.
I wouldn't say anything I tried punched my mouth with the WOW factor, but Pearl's is unique as a burger joint.Pearl's has Carl's Jr size burgers, without the fast food behind it. The menu is large with a great amount of variety. From turkey, beef, kobe beef, and buffalo for your meat options, to salads, hot dogs, fries, onion rings and shakes. One good thing about the place is that you can get your meat cooked anyway you want it. Medium rare or anything lower if you dare is how I would suggest your meat be cooked. The buns they use tend to get dry towards the end, so all the juice you can get helps a lot as you try and devour the large size monster.Small spot, with only 3 tables and window seating. Cash only.
