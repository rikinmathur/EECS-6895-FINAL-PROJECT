We came to the California Historical Society to see their Panama Pacific International Exposition (PPIE) exhibit.  Admission was $5, but it was well worth it.  The first thing we saw was a large scale model of the fairgrounds.  The display is so big your eyes are naturally drawn to it.  Next to the model were some chunks of the original (temporary) Palace of Fine Arts.  Apparently this massive relic was lost in a warehouse for years, and then conservators had to painstakingly remove all the dust and dirt before putting it on display.  They did a wonderful job.The room facing the street has many interesting artifacts.  You can see actual ticket books and badges used by the fair-goers.  Especially interesting was the ticket book belonging to a child.  Apparently you had to have your picture taken at certain studios in San Francisco, and this official photo had to be attached to the inside of the ticket book for it to be valid.  On the wall is a shovel used by President Taft to launch the Exposition.Some of the other rooms have a short video on a flat panel TV about the Exposition, all are worth watching.  They are about 3 minutes long.  You can also see old telephones, souvenirs ranging from books to ashtrays, buttons, along with posters and photographs from the PPIE.  The coolest things of all were the Novagems, which used to adorn the Tower of Jewels.There is a seating area in front of a big TV in the center of the room.  You can watch actual footage from the fair, it's on an endless loop and keep repeating.  On the coffee table in front of you are a collection of books about the PPIE you can thumb through.  Loved it!
Definitely one of the smaller museums. $5 for everyone besides members and children (free for both). I've seen this place packed from pics on their website but it was empty. There's only one floor open (second floor is off limits). There's a lot to see in the one space and you get a glimpse of history and events in California's history. And I got quite a few photos. It's a small place in a busy area if you have a 20 minutes or so to kill and want to check out a museum.
I went to the California Historical Society recently for a presentation of food at the time of the 1915 Expo.  I could tell they put lots of care and thought into picking their presenters, giving a fair time allotment for each speaker and then they treat you to some wine tasting and food samples reminiscent from 1915 during that era.  I would go back to check out their exhibitions and for their events.  Lots to learn!
This little guy is located within a few blocks of other big museums:  MOMA, Children's Creativity Museum, Center for the Arts, Jewish Museum.  Compared to those, the California Historical Society is bound to be a letdown.  In a way, it was, but it depends on the exhibit.  If you're interested in the current exhibit, then you'll find it fascinating.In my case, they were showing artifacts from Yosemite's history.  Things that you're not likely to see anywhere else:  a large copy of the Yo-Semite Grant signed by President Abraham Lincoln, pictures and pamphlets of former hotels, photos of the cavalry, video of the Firefall and the 2013 Rim Fire, rock climbing equipment from 1930-70, stereo photographs from 1900.  For the kids, there was a guitar player leading in singing, and crafts for them to make.Worth checking out to see if anything piques your interest.
My husband and I were visiting recently from out of town. We were walking down Mission Street after visiting the Cartoon Art Museum and from across the street, we noticed the large windows of the California Historical Society, which was advertising their exhibit on the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition.As residents of Chicago (which held America's first World's Fair, the Columbian Exposition of 1893), history nerds, and world's fair fans, we knew we had to stop by. And we're so glad that we did! The Historical Society's exhibit did an excellent job presenting an overview of the Fair, from it's conception to current day remnants, and it did not shy away from examining the less-than positive aspects, including racism and classism. Adding additional layers of enjoyment for us was the security guard on duty, Ted, who was also a world fair fan. He kept popping in with all this great info about the underbelly of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition - those little known, and often salacious stories that really makes learning entertaining and fun. Thank you, Ted!I was also pleased to learn that the California Historical Society had teamed up with many/most of the other museums in San Francisco to present other aspects of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. We went to the Chinese Historical Society of America the next day and learned about the Fair and San Francisco of 1915 from the perspective of the Chinese Americans living there at the time. Fascinating stuff!
This place is a pretty neat little find in the middle of the city. We went here and learned all about the World Fair. I guess they change out things to learn about and the cost is pretty fair. It was a nice little learning experience.
If you have an interest in the Panama Pacific International Exposition in 1915 (PPIE), which is commemorating its centennial this year, RUN, do not walk to their exhibit.  There is a $5 entrance fee, well worth it.  They have painstakingly created a fantastic exhibition, with lots of memorabilia, souvenirs, vintage photos & displays. There's a large vintage model of the Expo, along with some original pieces from the Palace of Fine Arts, orig created from plaster.  There is the original shovel which President Taft dug the first shovelful of earth to launch the Expo. Photos & artifacts of the many countries that participated, U.S. States, U.S. company exhibits and so on. Several short videos to watch at different points.I really enjoyed this. It is running thru a date in December. I recommend going during the week and in the afternoon for less crowds.Small gift shop with lots of Ca themed books for sale & souvenir items.
One of my most favorite places in all of San Francisco, as I almost never pass up visiting it.  It is running events related to Yosemite National Park and while there actual artifacts of such, there are interesting panel discussions there as well.  Wonderful Place.
This is a precious organization with exhibits you won't find anywhere else.
I've been reading a lot about San Francisco history in the past few weeks, collecting books on old memoirs and photos from the turn of the century. Learning more about our vibrant and, often, vice-filled past makes me appreciate this city more, a city which I've always said was my favorite in the world to live in. California Historical Society is conveniently located in SoMa and it costs nothing to enter. They have rotating galleries and complimentary coffee and tea. Pay them a visit and chat up the friendly staff.
Great exhibition space, and very friendly employees. When I was there the current exhibit was about the Golden Gate Bridge. I loved seeing the old photos and design concepts. And a bonus for anyone who's into geocaching: They host a geocache right inside!
Went to Calif. Historical Society - my second time Wed 4/7/10.  They had a FREE evening from 6-8pm w/ music and free snacks.  The snacks were pretzels, celery w/ Trader Joe's hummus, & red vines.Filled out a survey and entered to win some books.  I wonder who won the 2nd drawing - didn't stay for it.Their new exhibit is "Think California" with some pics of Agriculture, Transportation, Tourism, People.There was some Silver Spade from the Panama-Pacific International Expo made by Shreve & Co.  That was kinda neat.Many forgettable artwork, it was close by 111 Minna Gallery & open so I went. It's across from the MOAD museum on Mission St near Kearny.Note: Lady told me it's FREE & Open late on the First Wed of the Month.
Currently, the California Historical Society has a Chinese in California exhibit running at the museum.The history of Chinese-Americans in California is often overlooked in California and American history, but there is a lot to know about the integral role that the Chinese had in California history. Most of the time these stories are relegated to Asian American-only venues, but I'm glad that the California Historical Society has presented the Chinese-Californian story as one that is relevant to California history overall.So, yes, this museum is quite small, Really, what you see is what you get. The exhibit is just on the main floor of the building, though I thought the exhibit would be much smaller than it actually was. I thought I would be able to breeze through and see most everything in ~20 minutes. Since I had made this into a work field trip (plus lunch), I felt compelled to move along quickly, but I would've spent ~45 minutes there. The exhibit mostly consisted of photographs, newspaper articles, letters, immigration papers, and old maps. Overall, I thought the installation was well-done and hit the highlights of Chinese-American/Californian history. All of that entertainment for the bargain price of $3!
My sister and I went to the CA Historical Society for the Yerba Buena Free4All, and this was closer to the last few museums that we visited. I would definitely not come back to this museum as only half of the museum was filled with exhibits. I didn't pay attention to any of the exhibits as they were really boring. I need more artifacts rather than reading throughout the entire museum. In addition, the gift shop didn't have any enticing stuff to purchase.Definitely would not come back or pay for admission.
Located around the corner from the Museum of Modern Art, this is a treasure trove of artifacts related to California's history. The facility also includes the requisite gift shop selling books, T-shirts, and assorted tchotchkes. Galleries are open Wednesday through Saturday, from noon until 4:30pm; adult admission is $3.
Cute little museum - I went in to see the show of Jack London's earthquake photographs that are up now. The prints and other 1906 memorabilia were very interesting. I thought the $3 admission was very reasonable (considering other museums in town) plus I got a free fancy booklet about the show. The limited hours (12 - 4:30, W-Sa) make visiting a bit difficult. The shop has some nice books and cards. Get a snack at A. G. Ferrari next door afterward.
Nice little shop to nose into when going to MOMA.  Filled with California stuff that's relevant and that would amuse even the locals as opposed to all the fake crap they have at Fisherman's Wharf for the tourists.  Good place to educate yourself about the state and it's history through archival photos and documents.
Great buildup and display of April 1906 earthquake in San Francisco information for $3. Get educated y'all

This little guy is located within a few blocks of other big museums:  MOMA, Children's Creativity Museum, Center for the Arts, Jewish Museum.  Compared to those, the California Historical Society is bound to be a letdown.  In a way, it was, but it depends on the exhibit.  If you're interested in the current exhibit, then you'll find it fascinating.In my case, they were showing artifacts from Yosemite's history.  Things that you're not likely to see anywhere else:  a large copy of the Yo-Semite Grant signed by President Abraham Lincoln, pictures and pamphlets of former hotels, photos of the cavalry, video of the Firefall and the 2013 Rim Fire, rock climbing equipment from 1930-70, stereo photographs from 1900.  For the kids, there was a guitar player leading in singing, and crafts for them to make.Worth checking out to see if anything piques your interest.
My husband and I were visiting recently from out of town. We were walking down Mission Street after visiting the Cartoon Art Museum and from across the street, we noticed the large windows of the California Historical Society, which was advertising their exhibit on the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition.As residents of Chicago (which held America's first World's Fair, the Columbian Exposition of 1893), history nerds, and world's fair fans, we knew we had to stop by. And we're so glad that we did! The Historical Society's exhibit did an excellent job presenting an overview of the Fair, from it's conception to current day remnants, and it did not shy away from examining the less-than positive aspects, including racism and classism. Adding additional layers of enjoyment for us was the security guard on duty, Ted, who was also a world fair fan. He kept popping in with all this great info about the underbelly of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition - those little known, and often salacious stories that really makes learning entertaining and fun. Thank you, Ted!I was also pleased to learn that the California Historical Society had teamed up with many/most of the other museums in San Francisco to present other aspects of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. We went to the Chinese Historical Society of America the next day and learned about the Fair and San Francisco of 1915 from the perspective of the Chinese Americans living there at the time. Fascinating stuff!
This place is a pretty neat little find in the middle of the city. We went here and learned all about the World Fair. I guess they change out things to learn about and the cost is pretty fair. It was a nice little learning experience.
If you have an interest in the Panama Pacific International Exposition in 1915 (PPIE), which is commemorating its centennial this year, RUN, do not walk to their exhibit.  There is a $5 entrance fee, well worth it.  They have painstakingly created a fantastic exhibition, with lots of memorabilia, souvenirs, vintage photos & displays. There's a large vintage model of the Expo, along with some original pieces from the Palace of Fine Arts, orig created from plaster.  There is the original shovel which President Taft dug the first shovelful of earth to launch the Expo. Photos & artifacts of the many countries that participated, U.S. States, U.S. company exhibits and so on. Several short videos to watch at different points.I really enjoyed this. It is running thru a date in December. I recommend going during the week and in the afternoon for less crowds.Small gift shop with lots of Ca themed books for sale & souvenir items.
One of my most favorite places in all of San Francisco, as I almost never pass up visiting it.  It is running events related to Yosemite National Park and while there actual artifacts of such, there are interesting panel discussions there as well.  Wonderful Place.
This is a precious organization with exhibits you won't find anywhere else.
I've been reading a lot about San Francisco history in the past few weeks, collecting books on old memoirs and photos from the turn of the century. Learning more about our vibrant and, often, vice-filled past makes me appreciate this city more, a city which I've always said was my favorite in the world to live in. California Historical Society is conveniently located in SoMa and it costs nothing to enter. They have rotating galleries and complimentary coffee and tea. Pay them a visit and chat up the friendly staff.
Great exhibition space, and very friendly employees. When I was there the current exhibit was about the Golden Gate Bridge. I loved seeing the old photos and design concepts. And a bonus for anyone who's into geocaching: They host a geocache right inside!
Went to Calif. Historical Society - my second time Wed 4/7/10.  They had a FREE evening from 6-8pm w/ music and free snacks.  The snacks were pretzels, celery w/ Trader Joe's hummus, & red vines.Filled out a survey and entered to win some books.  I wonder who won the 2nd drawing - didn't stay for it.Their new exhibit is "Think California" with some pics of Agriculture, Transportation, Tourism, People.There was some Silver Spade from the Panama-Pacific International Expo made by Shreve & Co.  That was kinda neat.Many forgettable artwork, it was close by 111 Minna Gallery & open so I went. It's across from the MOAD museum on Mission St near Kearny.Note: Lady told me it's FREE & Open late on the First Wed of the Month.
Currently, the California Historical Society has a Chinese in California exhibit running at the museum.The history of Chinese-Americans in California is often overlooked in California and American history, but there is a lot to know about the integral role that the Chinese had in California history. Most of the time these stories are relegated to Asian American-only venues, but I'm glad that the California Historical Society has presented the Chinese-Californian story as one that is relevant to California history overall.So, yes, this museum is quite small, Really, what you see is what you get. The exhibit is just on the main floor of the building, though I thought the exhibit would be much smaller than it actually was. I thought I would be able to breeze through and see most everything in ~20 minutes. Since I had made this into a work field trip (plus lunch), I felt compelled to move along quickly, but I would've spent ~45 minutes there. The exhibit mostly consisted of photographs, newspaper articles, letters, immigration papers, and old maps. Overall, I thought the installation was well-done and hit the highlights of Chinese-American/Californian history. All of that entertainment for the bargain price of $3!
My sister and I went to the CA Historical Society for the Yerba Buena Free4All, and this was closer to the last few museums that we visited. I would definitely not come back to this museum as only half of the museum was filled with exhibits. I didn't pay attention to any of the exhibits as they were really boring. I need more artifacts rather than reading throughout the entire museum. In addition, the gift shop didn't have any enticing stuff to purchase.Definitely would not come back or pay for admission.
Located around the corner from the Museum of Modern Art, this is a treasure trove of artifacts related to California's history. The facility also includes the requisite gift shop selling books, T-shirts, and assorted tchotchkes. Galleries are open Wednesday through Saturday, from noon until 4:30pm; adult admission is $3.
Cute little museum - I went in to see the show of Jack London's earthquake photographs that are up now. The prints and other 1906 memorabilia were very interesting. I thought the $3 admission was very reasonable (considering other museums in town) plus I got a free fancy booklet about the show. The limited hours (12 - 4:30, W-Sa) make visiting a bit difficult. The shop has some nice books and cards. Get a snack at A. G. Ferrari next door afterward.
Nice little shop to nose into when going to MOMA.  Filled with California stuff that's relevant and that would amuse even the locals as opposed to all the fake crap they have at Fisherman's Wharf for the tourists.  Good place to educate yourself about the state and it's history through archival photos and documents.
Great buildup and display of April 1906 earthquake in San Francisco information for $3. Get educated y'all
