This is an outstanding place. At the glory of Potrero Hill, comes a restaurant that is just wonderful for a meal. They have all sorts of appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and entrees, with strong influence from both France and the United States alike. Prices vary a bit, but are very reasonable, especially by San Francisco standards.It was refreshing to go here. I had the basic burger, one of their popular dishes, but I added roquefort cheese and, so should you. My soda did come in a bottle, but that's about my only complaint. The bread was refilled. In due time, my burger came. Such cheese enhanced the burger, all just heaven on a plate. The fries on the side had a great seasoning. I shall not hesistate to come back.A meal at Chez Maman means not overthinking it.
Nom nom nom.  Such a cute little place right down the road from us. It was super busy when we arrived for dinner but luckily we didn't have to wait for a table as another couple were just leaving.  The inside reminds me of a place in Europe.  Small tables and really close seating.  Make friends with your neighbor!I started with a glass of wine and some baked Camembert.  The French waiter approved.  When it came out the cheese was so warm and tasty on the bread.  It also came with a huge side salad a two fried balls.  I didn't realize what they were until I dug into it.  Turns out to be a whole fried garlic.  Two on my plate.  The taste was overwhelmingly strong.  I could do without it, maybe the French love it.  My main was suggested by the waiter since I was having trouble deciding.  It was the porkchop with Brussel sprouts.  Such a great recommendation.  The mushroom sauce that came with it went perfect with the pork.  Was quite a big serving as well.  It was a tad pink inside but my bf said it was safe to eat.  Very delicious and tender.And lastly dessert was the creme brûlée.  I should have gotten a sweet crepe cause the creme brûlée was good but wasn't anything fancy about it.  Next time I'm going for the crepe.
I've been on a bit of a lucky streak with dates who "get it" when it comes to food. What a refreshing change for once! I shared my passionate opinion on SF Asian food over a glass of wine and he shared his experience with French and Moroccan food. During the conversation (where he also poked fun at my pronunciation of "Michelin"), Chez Maman came up and since it's a place I've had bookmarked for longer than I can remember, I jumped on the opportunity to try it out.I love neighborhood restaurants like Chez Maman. We sat outside on a slightly tilted sidewalk. There were several times where clumsy me almost rolled out of the chair. I suppose that's part of the charm of this place. He and the waiter chatted in French and in a few minutes, two dishes and another bottle of wine appeared in front of me. I focused my attention on the Flat Iron Steak, which was cooked perfectly. The only thing is, it didn't seem that "French" to me. He worked on the Lamb & Veggie Brochettes, which he was clearly more fond of than I was. I was beyond full and couldn't even finish the entree yet the waiter talked him into getting creme brulee for dessert. I was peer pressured into eating my half of it. The burnt sugar at the top had just the right amount of crisp.
Chez Maman was definitely a solid 4-1/2 stars - hip décor, welcoming waiters/waitresses, and tasty food. It is located on the corner in a quiet neighborhood of Portrero Hill. They do not have much seating inside and do not take reservations, but still worth eating waiting to eat here. The food was on-point!We had the basic burger and porkchop with Brussel sprouts. The burger was cooked medium rare--just the perfect amount of juiciness. The order also came with fries or salad. We ordered the salad to balance off the heavy taste of the burger and was very happy with the choice. The salad was light and refreshing. The porkchop dish was even better! The sauce was amazing: bacon & apple cider mustard sauce. Who would have thought apple cider mustard sauce went really well with porkchop? The meat was very tender and chewy. To top it off, we shared a scoop of Salted-caramel with almond gelato. It was not too sweet, and the almonds complemented the caramel well.  I was not even hungry and I cleaned off all my plates. We will definitely come back.
I "don't like French food" but Chez Maman has been on my to-eat list for a while. I had my eye on the Hayes Valley location but came here for lunch today with a colleague.The line at Plow was ridic so we got a table for lunch here. Service was super kind and the French accents are a nice touch ;) We shared the Brie, salad and walnuts to start. We also both had the Niçoise salad (available with tuna or salmon). Salad was delicious but hard boiled eggs were overlooked. Complimentary bread and butter was a nice surprise. Will be back to try other dishes. Someone next to us had a burger and it looked amazing!
This place gets crowded for lunch! Luckily, M and I arrived shortly after they opened so getting a table wasn't a problem.I ordered the Merguez Panini since I loved it so much at their sister restaurant, Gamine. I thought it was good, but slightly different than the first time I had it. I don't think I would order it again here because I remembered it differently than my first experience. It lacked the saltiness and richness that I loved so much. It was still good but different. I was totally jealous of M's veal dish. The creamy mushroom sauce was to die for. Maybe this was why my panini didn't taste as yummy as I had hoped... I had entree envy! Lol.Next time I'll try the burger that everyone raves about. Hopefully it won't disappoint!::update::The burger is definitely the way to go! I ordered it with Brie and bacon but they forgot the bacon and I was too hungry to wait haha. It was still really tasty. The fries were perfect and they give you a generous portion.
Foods are good here. I loved the escrgo and my mushroom fettucini. The burger my husband ordered was a little too oily thou.. Overall I love their food. The only draw back is the seating there is a bit cramped..especially w  2 kids.. and such a small restaurant, not many tables.. Since it's popular place, we always have to wait.
One of my favorite restaurants in ALL of San Francisco. If you haven't come here, you're missing out. It's telling if you have just as much fun waiting (you can enjoy a glass of somethin' outside under the moonlight) as you do when you're seated. Best clams in SF. Right here. Their burger is also amazing while their fries are better than the McDonalds fries that you remember having as a 3 year old. Yea, they're THAT good.
This neighborhood gem has the best food ever. I'm a NYC resident and often can be a bit of a food snob. The service was wonderful but not to be outdone by the escargot, salad with goat cheese and les moules poulette. Bravo chez maman. I will be back and this is now on my list of faves in San Fran.
A friend was heading up into the City from South Bay and was in the Potrero Hill area so we ended up here. I read the reviews and decided on a burger - decked out with brie and avocado. I was going to go with an egg too, but the waiter suggested the two was enough. Burger was deliciously cooked, the brie and avocado were great additions, creamy and fatty! The fries were okay, but the real star is the burger. Service there is great and we sat outside with no real issues. Actually it was kind of warm outside with the heat lamps. protip: no reservations, but you can get a table pretty easily if you get there early.
Came here with a friend for dinner around 5:30 and we were able to be seated right away. We were at a table outside, which was okay because it looked a bit crowded inside. Overall a really nice ambiance and authentic French dining experience.As for the food, everything was amazing! We got an order of the escargots to start, which were really flavorful, and the sauce was a perfect pairing for the bread they give you. Highly recommend ordering, especially if you've never tried them because these were some of the best escargot I've had. For my entree, I ordered the Poulette Moules, which were just as tasty. The sauce was robust and buttery, and the shallots and bacon were a great touch. I also got a side of the fries which tasted really good when dipped in the broth.Overall, it was an amazing dining experience, with friendly staff, and you really can't beat the price. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a great French restaurant in Hayes!
C'est la vie... Oui....Monsier!I seem to be trending French cuisine in the past weeks.... recently in Boston, prior to that from Los Angeles... and now in my hometown, San Francisco!!Chez Maman is truly a neighborhood gem where locals meets their neighbors, the City folks and then some (tourists).  Brought my coworkers here because truly, this is one of my favorite French "goto" place to dine in the City!!  Really dig their local vibe, love the hip ambiance.  Love their cute outdoor dining with heaters to boot, and I especially enjoy dining in at their counter, where I get to see tons of action.  Definitely a great conversational piece with lots of interaction with the staff, and best of all; their food here has got to be, one of the best of the best!  Simple French cooking with a little love from "Maman!"PS - their "Crème brûlée" is simply magnifique!!Until then, Cheers! ~ :p
The food was decent, but overall I wasn't quite as impressed as I had hoped. Before I get into the details here, the wait here was super long since the location is rather small especially for larger parties (but I expected this so it wasn't a huge factor in my rating). I ordered a salmon eggs benedict and a side of fries. The eggs benedict was quite standard, as in it was tasty but not special enough to leave a lasting impression on my taste buds. The fries were delicious though, and were seasoned nicely. There was also a portion of bread and butter served before the meal...the bread was not toasted and rather cold and hard to the bite, but nonetheless was a nice reprieve from our hunger. Staff was actually accommodating and friendly and gave us realistic expectations when it came to the wait for our party. While I wouldn't mind returning to this location, I also won't be eagerly returning. If I do return, I would want to try their burger!
Admittedly, Chez Maman was second-choice option for me on the day I came here. But I was definitely NOT about that 2 hour line at Plow two blocks down. Literally walked in as soon as we stopped by. Besides, Chez Maman had also been bookmarked for a while...so I feel ZERO guilt about my spur-of-the-moment decisionmaking.In any case, if one is to come to a French eatery, then one must not make a head scratching decision. Basically, that ruled out the entire menu for me except for the crepes (because after all, why the hell would I eat a burger when CREPES are on the table???). Was suggested to try the Complète crepe...yep, that was a win.Chez Maman isn't the biggest place. In fact, I would be pretty surprised if you could fit more than 20 people in here. However, the small size of the restaurant does add to the vibe of the place as it makes it feel more like a true French restaurant. I get the sense that if this wasn't such a popular Yelp destination, it would just feel like one of those places in the neighborhood for the locals to frequent.Definitely enjoyed my experience here, would come again!
We both had the Basic Burger adding on avocado, mushrooms, and bacon. One of us added Brie and the other added Roquefort. We ordered them medium and they were cooked perfectly. The bacon was really good. Burgers were good but not amazing. The bun was a ciabatta that was yummy, but made for difficult chewing. The fries were tasty. Overall this was a good burger, but not the best burger in SF that I was expecting.
Chez Maman is an experience! The staff is friendly and hilarious. The food is amazing! I cannot say enough great things about Chez Maman. It is a really small restaurant so expect a wait even if you arrive here late (ie, 9pm).  Service can be on the slower side since they are quite popular, but it's well worth the wait and the staff will make you laugh as you wait :P They're known for their burger and their mussels. Both are excellent. I also had their french onion soup which was delicious but quite heavy. I will definitely be back (a lot)! Reasonably priced, amazing food, awesome staff -- what more can you ask for?
I came here twice, once for dinner on a Friday night and once for brunch on Sunday morning. The service here was great both times! There was a wait on Friday night but I had a free glass of wine while I waited. Every dish that I've tried here has been great! For dinner we had a burger and the mussels, and for brunch the eggs florentine. The portions are pretty big and I'd recommend coming here anytime! I will definitely be back to try other goodies on the menu :)
Came here on a Saturday after 12pm - no wait! I got the basic burger and added brie. It was good! Tender, juicy, and cooked medium rare just as I requested. The basic burger is your typical American burger with a French twist. I wanted to add avocado and an egg but didn't want to pay for a $20 burger haha. The real winner of Chez Maman is their aioli. THEY HAVE THE BEST AILOI EVER. It was creamy, light, and had a hint of garlic. It tasted perfect with their fresh french fries. Chez Maman is pretty small, so I don't recommend coming here with large groups. However, it is the perfect place for a date with a significant other or a catch-up brunch date with a couple of friends! Decent prices, yummy food, good service. I can't wait to come here back here for dinner....and that aioli!
Maybe a perfect French bistro?You can smell CM from about a block away.  Once you're across the street, forget about it.It smells amazing.I mean, REALLY amazing.It's small. There's only 7 tables inside.  One large booth for 6, the rest are 2 tops.   Counter seating for 10 I think.2 small tables outside.That's all folks.Between the amazing aromas & the small size, naturally it's always packed.  We went by randomly & I couldn't believe it would only be a 5 minute wait.  We totally lucked out.Our waiter was a prince.  It was packed, but he was thoroughly unruffled.  Funny & nice, a real pro.The Malbec for him, the French Pinot Noir for me.  Both were great accompaniments to our French bistro dinner.The Camembert.  Divine.  Melted, gooey, piping hot cheese, roasted garlic, spread on toast?  Honestly, your worries dissipate w every bite.The basic burger.  Let me tell you, this "basic" burger can give a lot of other "un-basic" burgers a piece of advice.  The meat was cooked per my request, medium well, & was still moist & juicy.  I asked our waiter what cheese he would recommend.  Brie was his immediate answer.  Then came the gentle suggestion of mushrooms.  Yes, yes, yes.  Pourquoi pas?!  A divine combination, & the burger was not at all soggy.  Major props.My man.  Sigh.  He didn't feel like a heavy dish, so he went w the chicken panini.  It's a cold sandwich, & is more like a picnic meal as opposed to a dinner option.  It was tasty, but then I love pesto...The burger just blew the panini out of the water.The burger also outshone the French fries.  They were okay, but not exceptional.  Great for dipping in your mussels & frites, but unremarkable.The table next to ours ordered the lamb sausage plate.  I ate it w my eyes.  All of it.There's no disputing CM is a bonafide gem.  Cozy, relaxed, & romantic.  Service & food were above par, despite being constantly packed.  Props.4 & 1/2 stars.
Great food, good service. Chez maman is now a few doors down in the old chez papa location. Thought this larger location would cut down wait times (no reservations taken) but for a table for 4 on a tues night around 7:30 pm, we still waited about an hour (for 1st available, it was a table outside but heat lamps were on). The french onion soup is the BEST! We also tried the escargot, salmon burger, moules mariniere, rack of lambs and pasta carbonera. The salmon burger and pasta were average. Escargot was above average. Lamb and mussels were on point!Creme brulee was good - top could've been a bit more caramelized.

It was super busy when we arrived for dinner but luckily we didn't have to wait for a table as another couple were just leaving.  The inside reminds me of a place in Europe.  Small tables and really close seating.  Make friends with your neighbor!I started with a glass of wine and some baked Camembert.  The French waiter approved.  When it came out the cheese was so warm and tasty on the bread.  It also came with a huge side salad a two fried balls.  I didn't realize what they were until I dug into it.  Turns out to be a whole fried garlic.  Two on my plate.  The taste was overwhelmingly strong.  I could do without it, maybe the French love it.  My main was suggested by the waiter since I was having trouble deciding.  It was the porkchop with Brussel sprouts.  Such a great recommendation.  The mushroom sauce that came with it went perfect with the pork.  Was quite a big serving as well.  It was a tad pink inside but my bf said it was safe to eat.  Very delicious and tender.And lastly dessert was the creme brûlée.  I should have gotten a sweet crepe cause the creme brûlée was good but wasn't anything fancy about it.  Next time I'm going for the crepe.
I've been on a bit of a lucky streak with dates who "get it" when it comes to food. What a refreshing change for once! I shared my passionate opinion on SF Asian food over a glass of wine and he shared his experience with French and Moroccan food. During the conversation (where he also poked fun at my pronunciation of "Michelin"), Chez Maman came up and since it's a place I've had bookmarked for longer than I can remember, I jumped on the opportunity to try it out.I love neighborhood restaurants like Chez Maman. We sat outside on a slightly tilted sidewalk. There were several times where clumsy me almost rolled out of the chair. I suppose that's part of the charm of this place. He and the waiter chatted in French and in a few minutes, two dishes and another bottle of wine appeared in front of me. I focused my attention on the Flat Iron Steak, which was cooked perfectly. The only thing is, it didn't seem that "French" to me. He worked on the Lamb & Veggie Brochettes, which he was clearly more fond of than I was. I was beyond full and couldn't even finish the entree yet the waiter talked him into getting creme brulee for dessert. I was peer pressured into eating my half of it. The burnt sugar at the top had just the right amount of crisp.
Chez Maman was definitely a solid 4-1/2 stars - hip décor, welcoming waiters/waitresses, and tasty food. It is located on the corner in a quiet neighborhood of Portrero Hill. They do not have much seating inside and do not take reservations, but still worth eating waiting to eat here. The food was on-point!We had the basic burger and porkchop with Brussel sprouts. The burger was cooked medium rare--just the perfect amount of juiciness. The order also came with fries or salad. We ordered the salad to balance off the heavy taste of the burger and was very happy with the choice. The salad was light and refreshing. The porkchop dish was even better! The sauce was amazing: bacon & apple cider mustard sauce. Who would have thought apple cider mustard sauce went really well with porkchop? The meat was very tender and chewy. To top it off, we shared a scoop of Salted-caramel with almond gelato. It was not too sweet, and the almonds complemented the caramel well.  I was not even hungry and I cleaned off all my plates. We will definitely come back.
I "don't like French food" but Chez Maman has been on my to-eat list for a while. I had my eye on the Hayes Valley location but came here for lunch today with a colleague.The line at Plow was ridic so we got a table for lunch here. Service was super kind and the French accents are a nice touch ;) We shared the Brie, salad and walnuts to start. We also both had the Niçoise salad (available with tuna or salmon). Salad was delicious but hard boiled eggs were overlooked. Complimentary bread and butter was a nice surprise. Will be back to try other dishes. Someone next to us had a burger and it looked amazing!
This place gets crowded for lunch! Luckily, M and I arrived shortly after they opened so getting a table wasn't a problem.I ordered the Merguez Panini since I loved it so much at their sister restaurant, Gamine. I thought it was good, but slightly different than the first time I had it. I don't think I would order it again here because I remembered it differently than my first experience. It lacked the saltiness and richness that I loved so much. It was still good but different. I was totally jealous of M's veal dish. The creamy mushroom sauce was to die for. Maybe this was why my panini didn't taste as yummy as I had hoped... I had entree envy! Lol.Next time I'll try the burger that everyone raves about. Hopefully it won't disappoint!::update::The burger is definitely the way to go! I ordered it with Brie and bacon but they forgot the bacon and I was too hungry to wait haha. It was still really tasty. The fries were perfect and they give you a generous portion.
Foods are good here. I loved the escrgo and my mushroom fettucini. The burger my husband ordered was a little too oily thou.. Overall I love their food. The only draw back is the seating there is a bit cramped..especially w  2 kids.. and such a small restaurant, not many tables.. Since it's popular place, we always have to wait.
One of my favorite restaurants in ALL of San Francisco. If you haven't come here, you're missing out. It's telling if you have just as much fun waiting (you can enjoy a glass of somethin' outside under the moonlight) as you do when you're seated. Best clams in SF. Right here. Their burger is also amazing while their fries are better than the McDonalds fries that you remember having as a 3 year old. Yea, they're THAT good.
This neighborhood gem has the best food ever. I'm a NYC resident and often can be a bit of a food snob. The service was wonderful but not to be outdone by the escargot, salad with goat cheese and les moules poulette. Bravo chez maman. I will be back and this is now on my list of faves in San Fran.
A friend was heading up into the City from South Bay and was in the Potrero Hill area so we ended up here. I read the reviews and decided on a burger - decked out with brie and avocado. I was going to go with an egg too, but the waiter suggested the two was enough. Burger was deliciously cooked, the brie and avocado were great additions, creamy and fatty! The fries were okay, but the real star is the burger. Service there is great and we sat outside with no real issues. Actually it was kind of warm outside with the heat lamps. protip: no reservations, but you can get a table pretty easily if you get there early.
Came here with a friend for dinner around 5:30 and we were able to be seated right away. We were at a table outside, which was okay because it looked a bit crowded inside. Overall a really nice ambiance and authentic French dining experience.As for the food, everything was amazing! We got an order of the escargots to start, which were really flavorful, and the sauce was a perfect pairing for the bread they give you. Highly recommend ordering, especially if you've never tried them because these were some of the best escargot I've had. For my entree, I ordered the Poulette Moules, which were just as tasty. The sauce was robust and buttery, and the shallots and bacon were a great touch. I also got a side of the fries which tasted really good when dipped in the broth.Overall, it was an amazing dining experience, with friendly staff, and you really can't beat the price. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a great French restaurant in Hayes!
C'est la vie... Oui....Monsier!I seem to be trending French cuisine in the past weeks.... recently in Boston, prior to that from Los Angeles... and now in my hometown, San Francisco!!Chez Maman is truly a neighborhood gem where locals meets their neighbors, the City folks and then some (tourists).  Brought my coworkers here because truly, this is one of my favorite French "goto" place to dine in the City!!  Really dig their local vibe, love the hip ambiance.  Love their cute outdoor dining with heaters to boot, and I especially enjoy dining in at their counter, where I get to see tons of action.  Definitely a great conversational piece with lots of interaction with the staff, and best of all; their food here has got to be, one of the best of the best!  Simple French cooking with a little love from "Maman!"PS - their "Crème brûlée" is simply magnifique!!Until then, Cheers! ~ :p
The food was decent, but overall I wasn't quite as impressed as I had hoped. Before I get into the details here, the wait here was super long since the location is rather small especially for larger parties (but I expected this so it wasn't a huge factor in my rating). I ordered a salmon eggs benedict and a side of fries. The eggs benedict was quite standard, as in it was tasty but not special enough to leave a lasting impression on my taste buds. The fries were delicious though, and were seasoned nicely. There was also a portion of bread and butter served before the meal...the bread was not toasted and rather cold and hard to the bite, but nonetheless was a nice reprieve from our hunger. Staff was actually accommodating and friendly and gave us realistic expectations when it came to the wait for our party. While I wouldn't mind returning to this location, I also won't be eagerly returning. If I do return, I would want to try their burger!
Admittedly, Chez Maman was second-choice option for me on the day I came here. But I was definitely NOT about that 2 hour line at Plow two blocks down. Literally walked in as soon as we stopped by. Besides, Chez Maman had also been bookmarked for a while...so I feel ZERO guilt about my spur-of-the-moment decisionmaking.In any case, if one is to come to a French eatery, then one must not make a head scratching decision. Basically, that ruled out the entire menu for me except for the crepes (because after all, why the hell would I eat a burger when CREPES are on the table???). Was suggested to try the Complète crepe...yep, that was a win.Chez Maman isn't the biggest place. In fact, I would be pretty surprised if you could fit more than 20 people in here. However, the small size of the restaurant does add to the vibe of the place as it makes it feel more like a true French restaurant. I get the sense that if this wasn't such a popular Yelp destination, it would just feel like one of those places in the neighborhood for the locals to frequent.Definitely enjoyed my experience here, would come again!
We both had the Basic Burger adding on avocado, mushrooms, and bacon. One of us added Brie and the other added Roquefort. We ordered them medium and they were cooked perfectly. The bacon was really good. Burgers were good but not amazing. The bun was a ciabatta that was yummy, but made for difficult chewing. The fries were tasty. Overall this was a good burger, but not the best burger in SF that I was expecting.
Chez Maman is an experience! The staff is friendly and hilarious. The food is amazing! I cannot say enough great things about Chez Maman. It is a really small restaurant so expect a wait even if you arrive here late (ie, 9pm).  Service can be on the slower side since they are quite popular, but it's well worth the wait and the staff will make you laugh as you wait :P They're known for their burger and their mussels. Both are excellent. I also had their french onion soup which was delicious but quite heavy. I will definitely be back (a lot)! Reasonably priced, amazing food, awesome staff -- what more can you ask for?
I came here twice, once for dinner on a Friday night and once for brunch on Sunday morning. The service here was great both times! There was a wait on Friday night but I had a free glass of wine while I waited. Every dish that I've tried here has been great! For dinner we had a burger and the mussels, and for brunch the eggs florentine. The portions are pretty big and I'd recommend coming here anytime! I will definitely be back to try other goodies on the menu :)
Came here on a Saturday after 12pm - no wait! I got the basic burger and added brie. It was good! Tender, juicy, and cooked medium rare just as I requested. The basic burger is your typical American burger with a French twist. I wanted to add avocado and an egg but didn't want to pay for a $20 burger haha. The real winner of Chez Maman is their aioli. THEY HAVE THE BEST AILOI EVER. It was creamy, light, and had a hint of garlic. It tasted perfect with their fresh french fries. Chez Maman is pretty small, so I don't recommend coming here with large groups. However, it is the perfect place for a date with a significant other or a catch-up brunch date with a couple of friends! Decent prices, yummy food, good service. I can't wait to come here back here for dinner....and that aioli!
Maybe a perfect French bistro?You can smell CM from about a block away.  Once you're across the street, forget about it.It smells amazing.I mean, REALLY amazing.It's small. There's only 7 tables inside.  One large booth for 6, the rest are 2 tops.   Counter seating for 10 I think.2 small tables outside.That's all folks.Between the amazing aromas & the small size, naturally it's always packed.  We went by randomly & I couldn't believe it would only be a 5 minute wait.  We totally lucked out.Our waiter was a prince.  It was packed, but he was thoroughly unruffled.  Funny & nice, a real pro.The Malbec for him, the French Pinot Noir for me.  Both were great accompaniments to our French bistro dinner.The Camembert.  Divine.  Melted, gooey, piping hot cheese, roasted garlic, spread on toast?  Honestly, your worries dissipate w every bite.The basic burger.  Let me tell you, this "basic" burger can give a lot of other "un-basic" burgers a piece of advice.  The meat was cooked per my request, medium well, & was still moist & juicy.  I asked our waiter what cheese he would recommend.  Brie was his immediate answer.  Then came the gentle suggestion of mushrooms.  Yes, yes, yes.  Pourquoi pas?!  A divine combination, & the burger was not at all soggy.  Major props.My man.  Sigh.  He didn't feel like a heavy dish, so he went w the chicken panini.  It's a cold sandwich, & is more like a picnic meal as opposed to a dinner option.  It was tasty, but then I love pesto...The burger just blew the panini out of the water.The burger also outshone the French fries.  They were okay, but not exceptional.  Great for dipping in your mussels & frites, but unremarkable.The table next to ours ordered the lamb sausage plate.  I ate it w my eyes.  All of it.There's no disputing CM is a bonafide gem.  Cozy, relaxed, & romantic.  Service & food were above par, despite being constantly packed.  Props.4 & 1/2 stars.
Great food, good service. Chez maman is now a few doors down in the old chez papa location. Thought this larger location would cut down wait times (no reservations taken) but for a table for 4 on a tues night around 7:30 pm, we still waited about an hour (for 1st available, it was a table outside but heat lamps were on). The french onion soup is the BEST! We also tried the escargot, salmon burger, moules mariniere, rack of lambs and pasta carbonera. The salmon burger and pasta were average. Escargot was above average. Lamb and mussels were on point!Creme brulee was good - top could've been a bit more caramelized.
This is an outstanding place. At the glory of Potrero Hill, comes a restaurant that is just wonderful for a meal. They have all sorts of appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and entrees, with strong influence from both France and the United States alike. Prices vary a bit, but are very reasonable, especially by San Francisco standards.It was refreshing to go here. I had the basic burger, one of their popular dishes, but I added roquefort cheese and, so should you. My soda did come in a bottle, but that's about my only complaint. The bread was refilled. In due time, my burger came. Such cheese enhanced the burger, all just heaven on a plate. The fries on the side had a great seasoning. I shall not hesistate to come back.A meal at Chez Maman means not overthinking it.
