The first 4 sets of stairs was fine. I was having fun! The view was beautiful. I saw the Bay Bridge! Gorgeous houses! And there's so many roses! Then I started to go further up. I felt like death. My heart was beating really fast, got a little sweaty...but I can't just quit, I've just begun! ...But at some point I was like F this, I can't go on - it's too hot, bad decision to wear JEANS, and I was quite dehydrated.This also made me realize that I should have never stopped working out.  I didn't think these steps would be quite the workout, boy was I wrong.I will be back, Vallejo Steps, and I will conquer you.
The view from these steps are breathtaking on a clear day. You can see the tall buildings of the financial district on one side and the bay on the other side.  There is nice greenery adjacent to the steps as you make your way up or down that adds to beauty of this place. I would definitely recommend visiting this spot if you are nearby to take some pictures of the view.
My husband and I are on a mission! We hope to venture into the city to see as many staircases as we possibly can before we move next year. I'm sure that if you are reading this that you may have a similar agenda. Let me help!Visit this beautiful website for a full list of the Stairways of San Francisco. Prepare to be amazed! sisterbetty.org/stairway....We sectioned off stairways by location, and the Vallejo Street Steps were a part of our Telegraph Hill day. We also wanted to see the Coit Tower/stairs over there. It was a day FULL of exercise and sunshine. Perfect.These stairs were just beautiful. Start out early in the morning if you can, though, because the heat and direct sun can definitely be an anchor that pulls your energy down. Bring a camera and some sunscreen and get to hiking! This is an experience of a lifetime.Oh! Keep your eyes open for the Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill.

Great view. I wouldn't call it a tourist attraction, but it is a nice place to walk through if you're planning to get between North Beach and Russian Hill... especially if you're going west. Makes the trip uphill not so bad!
Not as cute as the steps up to Coit Tower, nor as pretty as those out in the Inner Sunset. Pretty standard. Similar to my neighborhood steps up Sanchez St. However, I saw a flock of wild parrots here. Heard lots of squawking then there they were in a tree above me on the steps just up from Taylor St. I've heard them all over the place before but never actually seen them up close before. Charmed!
Stellar view, parrots hang nearby, beautiful architecture.
it's definitely a cool view when it comes down to seeing both coit tower & transamerica, but there are definitely other locations throughout San Francisco that would be worth more of your time to go see if you are a tourist.  for example, mosaic steps @ grand view park, twin peaks, battery spencer, and much more!
Holy MOLY.My friend and I honestly stumbled across this while we were slowly making our way from Union to Fisherman's Wharf (much steep, very sore, ow) and I was blown away by the view. San Francisco is a beautiful city, it really is, and the Vallejo Street Steps allow you to soak it all in!The skies were clear, the air was crisp, and the sun was warm. Combined with the gorgeous view, there are few spots finer than this in California.Always make this a stop while wandering the city, you'll do your life a favor. Cheers.
This is a place that absolutely warrants a visit at night!Still, some people have been mugged nearby, and one must exercise caution.
Such a cute little area! Stumbled upon it while on a run and couldn't believe the views! There are a couple of benches to sit and enjoy the view, but otherwise not an area to set up picnic blankets and hang for hours like the park.
Beautiful view. My wife and I stumbled to it while getting brunch at North Beach and wanting to go to Lombard Street.
Terrific viewing on Auckland from here!!! This place is absolutely a must!!!!! Don't lose it fellas! ;)
The poor man's stair climber!  This is a great way to work off all the late night partying you've done on those North Beach Pub Crawls!!   Or, if you've had a late night on Polk or Hyde St, you can use the VStairs as your sobriety rest (if you don't break your neck stumbling down them you are sober!).
Oh the memories of the Vallejo Street Stairs. When I went to Galileo, I would use this route sometimes to get to school. Up and over the hill and make a right and I'm there. Never thought of this place as a means for a work out. I thought of it a different way to get to school. As I got older and had my bachelor party, I was too drunk. I walked or staggered from Van Ness all the way up to the grassy knoll on Vallejo. Realizing I didn't have my house keys with me, I decided to pass out and sleep there. Oh the memories. See, these steps serve other purposes other than working out.
These are AMAZING. As in, I'd do a lot of things to be able to enjoy the steps on a pleasant night. Great for exercise, great for a leisurely stroll, great for many other occasions.Also, there's no point in using flash photography to take pictures of the SF skyline if you come here during the night. You're just going to get grainy pics and annoy the other people there.
Stairway to heaven.Music destination: youtube.com/watch?v=BcL-…View destination: yelp.com/biz/ina-coolbri…These steps are magic for taking you there and being part of a city that is just heavenly.
You think you're in shape because you work out a bit at 24 hours!? Ha! I laugh in your general direction. You wanna see some fabulous views of SF? Ha! You're gonna have to work it, baby. Nothing worth having comes easy.Immediately after just eating half of a Molinari's sandwich at North Star café, the oldman wanted to take a walk.  I'm thinking - oh, a nice little walk around the neighborhood, peeping into stores, and window shopping... Then we turn onto Vallejo at Powell. As I saw the inclining hill, I thought "oh no, I remember this 'little' workout... Sh&t!"  I wanted to wring his neck, and bap the back of his head (I'm always bappin' the back of his head, though).  But, it was either walk up Vallejo St. and try to enjoy the spectacular views, or walk the Broadway tunnel (been there, done that... never again). So I grit my teeth and kept the 'safety on', by keeping my hands in my pocket.Starting at Powell and Vallejo, you'll start to feel the steady incline of the hill leading up to the steps at Mason St.  By the time you get to the actual steps, you should feel a sensational tingle/burn/pain in your butt and quads. Once you start walking up the steps, you may think... -Ah, how lovely!-Damn my legs are starting to hurt-What lucky bastards must live along these steps?-I don't envy having to deal with all of the looky-loos and peeping toms-When I get a house here, I'm definitely hiring a gardener!-Why am I attempting these steps on a full belly?-Where the f@$k is my camera?-Huff, puff, huff, puff... *hand over heart* Elizabeth! this is the big one!-Why am I keeping the 'safety on'?-When did that bulls eye form on the back of old man's head?Whew! So you've make it up the hill leading to the steps, then you make it up the steps by the cute little Ina Coolbrith park, and think...-Halle-fricken-lu-yeah! I made it!-Why didn't I bring the good camera?-WTF? Am I seeing another set of steps?-That's it, he's a gonner!Yes Virginia, there is ANOTHER set of steps as you cross Taylor St.  Take a deep breath, count to 10, and keep your hands in your pocket.Again, in every direction, there are beautiful views of SF, Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, etc. Just breath-taking, figuratively and literally speaking! Beautiful flora n' fauna (pet doggies), and wonderful architecture to behold.  Once you get to the top, you'll see the Hermitage building and more great views... it will almost make you forget about burning buttocks, stinging quads, and bulls-eyes growing on the back of bapp-able heads.It's all down hill from here.
Very cute area with great views of the city + a nice workout!If you're up for exploring the city, I would highly the Vallejo Street Steps.  Reminds me of the Santa Monica Stairs, but with more views & scenery and not quite as hard of a work out.
I was told not to walk in areas that I am unfamiliar while staying in San Francisco, but if I stuck to that advice, I wouldn't have observed the lushness, steepness, and calmness of the steps on Vallejo!  I was also told to take a street car, which would be tempting if you could see how steep some of the streets of SF are, but if I took that advice, I wouldn't have wallowed in the peace and aura that is on Vallejo.I'm glad I lived a little and took a change to go up this strange place, because in early April when the air is still crisp, but the botany is bright and colorful, the views from Vallejo are stunning!!  Your legs feel like they're going to fall off, but the flowers are gorgeous!  You may break a cold sweat, but your walk is not in vain.  And once you're at the top (finally at the top) you harbor serious jealousy at the beautiful condominiums and landscaping features.  Acgh!Anyway.  This was a highlight while I was in San Francisco.
A definite treat.  Undoubtedly one of the best views in the city (there may be 100s of best views, but still;).  I love coming up here during the morning when other morning walkers are strolling about, and there are actually quite a few benches to sit on and gaze over the downtown SF skyline, complete w/the beautiful Bay Bridge in the background.  Inspires me to try to find similar vistas throughout the city!

Such a cute little area! Stumbled upon it while on a run and couldn't believe the views! There are a couple of benches to sit and enjoy the view, but otherwise not an area to set up picnic blankets and hang for hours like the park.
Beautiful view. My wife and I stumbled to it while getting brunch at North Beach and wanting to go to Lombard Street.
Terrific viewing on Auckland from here!!! This place is absolutely a must!!!!! Don't lose it fellas! ;)
The poor man's stair climber!  This is a great way to work off all the late night partying you've done on those North Beach Pub Crawls!!   Or, if you've had a late night on Polk or Hyde St, you can use the VStairs as your sobriety rest (if you don't break your neck stumbling down them you are sober!).
Oh the memories of the Vallejo Street Stairs. When I went to Galileo, I would use this route sometimes to get to school. Up and over the hill and make a right and I'm there. Never thought of this place as a means for a work out. I thought of it a different way to get to school. As I got older and had my bachelor party, I was too drunk. I walked or staggered from Van Ness all the way up to the grassy knoll on Vallejo. Realizing I didn't have my house keys with me, I decided to pass out and sleep there. Oh the memories. See, these steps serve other purposes other than working out.
These are AMAZING. As in, I'd do a lot of things to be able to enjoy the steps on a pleasant night. Great for exercise, great for a leisurely stroll, great for many other occasions.Also, there's no point in using flash photography to take pictures of the SF skyline if you come here during the night. You're just going to get grainy pics and annoy the other people there.
Stairway to heaven.Music destination: youtube.com/watch?v=BcL-…View destination: yelp.com/biz/ina-coolbri…These steps are magic for taking you there and being part of a city that is just heavenly.
You think you're in shape because you work out a bit at 24 hours!? Ha! I laugh in your general direction. You wanna see some fabulous views of SF? Ha! You're gonna have to work it, baby. Nothing worth having comes easy.Immediately after just eating half of a Molinari's sandwich at North Star café, the oldman wanted to take a walk.  I'm thinking - oh, a nice little walk around the neighborhood, peeping into stores, and window shopping... Then we turn onto Vallejo at Powell. As I saw the inclining hill, I thought "oh no, I remember this 'little' workout... Sh&t!"  I wanted to wring his neck, and bap the back of his head (I'm always bappin' the back of his head, though).  But, it was either walk up Vallejo St. and try to enjoy the spectacular views, or walk the Broadway tunnel (been there, done that... never again). So I grit my teeth and kept the 'safety on', by keeping my hands in my pocket.Starting at Powell and Vallejo, you'll start to feel the steady incline of the hill leading up to the steps at Mason St.  By the time you get to the actual steps, you should feel a sensational tingle/burn/pain in your butt and quads. Once you start walking up the steps, you may think... -Ah, how lovely!-Damn my legs are starting to hurt-What lucky bastards must live along these steps?-I don't envy having to deal with all of the looky-loos and peeping toms-When I get a house here, I'm definitely hiring a gardener!-Why am I attempting these steps on a full belly?-Where the f@$k is my camera?-Huff, puff, huff, puff... *hand over heart* Elizabeth! this is the big one!-Why am I keeping the 'safety on'?-When did that bulls eye form on the back of old man's head?Whew! So you've make it up the hill leading to the steps, then you make it up the steps by the cute little Ina Coolbrith park, and think...-Halle-fricken-lu-yeah! I made it!-Why didn't I bring the good camera?-WTF? Am I seeing another set of steps?-That's it, he's a gonner!Yes Virginia, there is ANOTHER set of steps as you cross Taylor St.  Take a deep breath, count to 10, and keep your hands in your pocket.Again, in every direction, there are beautiful views of SF, Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, etc. Just breath-taking, figuratively and literally speaking! Beautiful flora n' fauna (pet doggies), and wonderful architecture to behold.  Once you get to the top, you'll see the Hermitage building and more great views... it will almost make you forget about burning buttocks, stinging quads, and bulls-eyes growing on the back of bapp-able heads.It's all down hill from here.
Very cute area with great views of the city + a nice workout!If you're up for exploring the city, I would highly the Vallejo Street Steps.  Reminds me of the Santa Monica Stairs, but with more views & scenery and not quite as hard of a work out.
I was told not to walk in areas that I am unfamiliar while staying in San Francisco, but if I stuck to that advice, I wouldn't have observed the lushness, steepness, and calmness of the steps on Vallejo!  I was also told to take a street car, which would be tempting if you could see how steep some of the streets of SF are, but if I took that advice, I wouldn't have wallowed in the peace and aura that is on Vallejo.I'm glad I lived a little and took a change to go up this strange place, because in early April when the air is still crisp, but the botany is bright and colorful, the views from Vallejo are stunning!!  Your legs feel like they're going to fall off, but the flowers are gorgeous!  You may break a cold sweat, but your walk is not in vain.  And once you're at the top (finally at the top) you harbor serious jealousy at the beautiful condominiums and landscaping features.  Acgh!Anyway.  This was a highlight while I was in San Francisco.
A definite treat.  Undoubtedly one of the best views in the city (there may be 100s of best views, but still;).  I love coming up here during the morning when other morning walkers are strolling about, and there are actually quite a few benches to sit on and gaze over the downtown SF skyline, complete w/the beautiful Bay Bridge in the background.  Inspires me to try to find similar vistas throughout the city!
