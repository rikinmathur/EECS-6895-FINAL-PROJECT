We stopped here on a Monday night around 7 pm after scooting around SOMA and the Ferry Building. We had our heart set on Super Duper, but thought it was only near the Metreon and on Market. Turns out there are *four* lovely downtown locations for burger goodness, and this one is a special gem. Aside from being super-close to the Embarcadero, there is easily double the seating of other locations, both indoors and outdoors. On a lovely spring night, it's hard to beat chilling outside with a beer and a Jenga tower. They keep baskets of the blocks on most tables, and it's a great time-kill while you wait for them to page you for your order. The folks working here are super-friendly, and the line was non-existent. Those of you who try to maintain a healthy diet during the work week, take note. ;-) From M-F until 7 pm, a $15 pitcher (or any alcohol purchase) gets you free fries! Even garlic fries! This is a great place to start a mid-week bar crawl, or to simply park yourself for an hour or so as you enjoy their incredible Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches ($7.50 / $8 with cheese). I can't get past the chipotle sauce on those - lots of subtle, wonderful heat. Load up on the free pickles! If there must be a flaw, it's that there is no on-premise bathroom, which is definitely a bummer. We were told "it's a bit of a trip" to get to, so we just ended up heading back to the Ferry Building. Oh wells. Also, there are several intrepid pigeons who will think nothing of lunging at your fries while you're actively eating them. Clapping and yelling will only make you look like an idiot. If this bothers you, best to sit inside. All said, this is a great stop, especially if you're looking to save some coin and recover from the sticker shock of Gott's. Pending another warm, beautiful evening, we'll be back!
My go to burger spot and favorite fast casual burger. I love that they're organic grass fed and cooked medium rare. There's always a long line to order but it moves relatively fast and the food comes pretty soon after. There's wine and beer on tap and free spiced pickles. Veggie burger is also pretty good and garlic fries are delicious. Ive been coming almost every Friday for a year and never get sick of it!
Yum! My go to place for burger and fries in the financial distirct! And why not play a game of janga while you're there? Relaxing spot for a burger in downtown SF. With both indoor and outdoor seating, visitors have the option to sit outside and enjoy the weather if it is nice.  The staff here are also great! Super duper nice (see what I did there?!)!
Since there was a huge conference going on at Moscone, my office couldn't find a Super Duper close to us that would take advance orders. (We're located Downtown.) That is, until they called the location on Mission at Spear. On Thursday, March 17th, we order lunch for pick up to celebrate St Patrick's Day.Since I'm not eating red meat for a while, I got the Chicken Sandwich: 100% natural free range chicken breast with chipotle aioli with with all The Free Stuff: Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Jalapeños, Grilled Onions and Housemade Pickles ($7.50), add Jack cheese (+$0.50), Roasted Portabello (+$1) and Organic Egg (+$1.50). I love Super Duper's burgers, but I can't say I feel the same about their chicken sandwich. The chicken was dry instead of being moist and tender. It may have suffered a bit from transit as the cheese had also hardened and the egg didn't provide the soft runny yolk I love. The pickles don't actually come in the burger, but Super Duper was nice enough to pack a to go container filled with pickles on the side.I did love the Garlic Fries: Fresh garlic & 6-month aged cheddar ($3.25) as usual. Though they did get a little soft and soggy in transit, I loved the garlicky and cheesy flavor. I decided to add Three Dips: Super Sauce, Housemade Mayo, Chipotle (+$1.50), but that may have been too much as the dips are very creamy and I believe mayo based. A touch of ketchup seemed to cut into the garlic fries better.I'm so glad this Super Duper was able to accommodate our big office order, but I found myself wishing I had ordered a burger instead of a chicken sandwich. Next time Super Duper, I will have one of your delicious cheeseburgers!
As tourists in San Francisco, we arrived here after heading eastwards, wandering in from Chinatown, on a Wednesday afternoon around 1:00 PM. It wasn't overtly busy, and we were able to grab ourselves a table.Service was decent, the garlic parmesan fries were absolutely delicious (a bit on the saltier side though), and the burger was perfectly juicy. If you're in the area, this isn't a bad option for a quick lunch, particularly if you're in a hurry.For a burger, garlic parmesan fries, and a chocolate shake, our total came to $17.30.
Always a good place to grab a quick burger in SF. It fits the guidelines of food quality in SF by being organic, grass-fed, and eco-friendly. I would recommend getting the Super Duper burger. Massive burger with two 4 oz patties with their special super sauce. If you're feeling in the mood to put on some calories and go on a sugar high the shakes are worth tryingl.
One of my favorite places for days when I'm craving for some not-so-healthy food. Absolutely love their burger with super sauce. My go-to meal? Mini burger with garlic fries. The garlic fries and be a hit or an almost-hit. They sometimes go a little bit overboard with the garlic sauce and the fries has a garlic-spicy taste. But most of the time, they're very excellent. They got great proportions on their burger, just the right amount of meat to bread. Not a huge lettuce fan, so I usually just get mine with cheese, super sauce, and tomato:) Their chicken sandwich is also very excellent, but the burger is my go-to.If you're feeling extra hungry, they also serve amazing milkshake and ice cream. However, most of the time, I'm too full after the burger and fries. My recommendation for milkshake: cookies & cream!
Ooooh typical Bay Area native alert but In n out is better. If you MUST have a burger in the financial district, Super Duper is the place to go. It's just a so-so burger that is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. Love the child portion milk shakes though. They're great when you got yourself a sweet tooth but are not trying to blow over your sugar limit for the day.
Super Duper Burger. Their shakes are made with skim milk so skip those. fries are edible and soda is the same type of fast food selection just cost more. they do have beer. and their tea is ok.Manager corrected below, but tastes like skim milk to me.I wont be back to that location, the others are so much better.
Friendly staff. Fresh burgers. Perfectly crisp fries with a soft center. We arrived before noon for lunch and it wasn't that busy, about one or two people were ordering ahead of us with two people working the registers. Tasha greeted each guest with a hello and asked if we had been there before. She said welcome back and proceeded to take our orders. She read my mind and gave me a cup for water after noticing the Starbucks in my hand. The burgers took about 7 minutes. Warm and juicy with a sesame seed bun equivalent to a mix of traditional dough/pretzel consistency. My only complaint is my roasted portobello mushrooms were cold. They weren't cooked with the burger, probably prepared beforehand. I like their garlic fries, but this time the amount of Parmesan overpowered the garlic. Unlimited pickles. I still haven't gotten a kids vanilla chocolate dipped cone (kids size is ok for adults too, as noted on their menu board).
Been here before. Burgers are decent. Unfortunately, garlic fries were cold. I never understood people who complained about cold food until today. There was 0% warmth in the fries. Either an arctic chill passed by in the 5 seconds it took to go from pick up to my seat or they served me cold fries. I'd guess the latter. I'm most annoyed that the servers served it to me. There's no way they weren't aware that the fries had been sitting there too long. It's too bad, I'm actually a fan of the burgers.
Grabbed a quick bite to eat before heading to the festivities. Very open and spacious with excellent service. It was very quick even during lunch hour. Fairly inexpensive and the doughnuts are just like the pier. The best part is the fresh side of pickles and jalapeños once you pick up your order. A little messy when you bite into your burger with all the fixings but it's a burger so chow down. Loved the food and the garlic fries are actually better than the ballpark. This is a hot spot so come early to beat the rush.
Wow I love this place so much, I'm a little bit ashamed I haven't written a review. When you go, here's what to get if you have amazing taste: cheeseburger with aged cheddar and everything on it, extra jalepenos, and a fried egg. For your side, the garlic parmesan fries and all the homemade pickles your heart desires. Just looking at the pictures of the food is making me a little koo-koo.You're welcome and enjoy.
Delicious!!! Definitely recommend this burger place. And their garlic cheese fries are amazing!
As soon as I took my first bite, I'm pretty sure I saw God. My tastebuds started singing hymns and my tummy said, "it is good."
Good lunch spot during the week.  Arrive before noon to beat the crowds and get a table.Burger, garlic fries and a milkshake.  Yes, order them all!
I love this place!!!!!!!!!The location is super convenient. But the sad thing is, the lines get super duper long ;)I recommend going at 9:30 for the breakfast combo of a cheese and egg sandwich, mini donut, and coffee.I recommend going at either 11:30 or 1:30 for lunch.Getting grilled onions on your burger is also a good direction to go into.Splurge on the sauces. The mayonaise is so good you can dip your fries in it and it's not even weird.
I love this place. Best burger is a simple burger.
In terms of service - Super Duper is really super duper - haha ok I'll stop. But in all seriousness - fast food burger chains are a dime a dozen - what really stood out here is not the food in particular but the customer service and experience. Usually a line 30+ deep wouldn't even have me considering it as a lunch option but I decided to check it out and if anything leave if the wait was too long. Once on line, I saw the manager come out with french fry samplers for those waiting in line - wow! you just don't expect that level of consideration and service at a fast food chain. Further down the line they had a small post sign that gave you an estimated wait time to order at that point - nice touch. They're pretty efficient as it didn't turn out to be too bad of a wait even with all the people. Once at the register - they were quick with the order and offered me water while I waited for my to-go order without me even asking. The orders also came out fairly quick - whatever they're doing works - they got a good system going on. Food wise - the garlic fries ($3.25) are amazing. The burger is pretty good for the value ($5.50 small) but mine came out a bit dry. Perhaps it was b/c of the lunch rush. The homemade pickles are ok - I liked that it had a kick to it but I prefer sweeter pickles - this was pretty salty. Overall great experience - highly recommend if you're looking for a casual lunch/ burger joint in FiDi. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well.
I hate grilled chicken sandwiches. And I hate driving up to the city from the south bay for anything. Yet I would drive to Super Duper Burgers in the city for their grilled chicken sandwich any day. Juicy, tasty sandwich with access to an unlimited amount of pickles. Suggested toppings: tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, and jalapenos. The garlic fries are the perfect complement, and if you're feeling extra gluttonous, I'd recommend tacking on the regular swirl (chocolate + vanilla) milkshake as well. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star review is its exorbitant prices. If only rent control could be applied to sandwich prices..

As soon as I took my first bite, I'm pretty sure I saw God. My tastebuds started singing hymns and my tummy said, "it is good."
Good lunch spot during the week.  Arrive before noon to beat the crowds and get a table.Burger, garlic fries and a milkshake.  Yes, order them all!
I love this place!!!!!!!!!The location is super convenient. But the sad thing is, the lines get super duper long ;)I recommend going at 9:30 for the breakfast combo of a cheese and egg sandwich, mini donut, and coffee.I recommend going at either 11:30 or 1:30 for lunch.Getting grilled onions on your burger is also a good direction to go into.Splurge on the sauces. The mayonaise is so good you can dip your fries in it and it's not even weird.
I love this place. Best burger is a simple burger.
In terms of service - Super Duper is really super duper - haha ok I'll stop. But in all seriousness - fast food burger chains are a dime a dozen - what really stood out here is not the food in particular but the customer service and experience. Usually a line 30+ deep wouldn't even have me considering it as a lunch option but I decided to check it out and if anything leave if the wait was too long. Once on line, I saw the manager come out with french fry samplers for those waiting in line - wow! you just don't expect that level of consideration and service at a fast food chain. Further down the line they had a small post sign that gave you an estimated wait time to order at that point - nice touch. They're pretty efficient as it didn't turn out to be too bad of a wait even with all the people. Once at the register - they were quick with the order and offered me water while I waited for my to-go order without me even asking. The orders also came out fairly quick - whatever they're doing works - they got a good system going on. Food wise - the garlic fries ($3.25) are amazing. The burger is pretty good for the value ($5.50 small) but mine came out a bit dry. Perhaps it was b/c of the lunch rush. The homemade pickles are ok - I liked that it had a kick to it but I prefer sweeter pickles - this was pretty salty. Overall great experience - highly recommend if you're looking for a casual lunch/ burger joint in FiDi. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well.
I hate grilled chicken sandwiches. And I hate driving up to the city from the south bay for anything. Yet I would drive to Super Duper Burgers in the city for their grilled chicken sandwich any day. Juicy, tasty sandwich with access to an unlimited amount of pickles. Suggested toppings: tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, and jalapenos. The garlic fries are the perfect complement, and if you're feeling extra gluttonous, I'd recommend tacking on the regular swirl (chocolate + vanilla) milkshake as well. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star review is its exorbitant prices. If only rent control could be applied to sandwich prices..
We stopped here on a Monday night around 7 pm after scooting around SOMA and the Ferry Building. We had our heart set on Super Duper, but thought it was only near the Metreon and on Market. Turns out there are *four* lovely downtown locations for burger goodness, and this one is a special gem. Aside from being super-close to the Embarcadero, there is easily double the seating of other locations, both indoors and outdoors. On a lovely spring night, it's hard to beat chilling outside with a beer and a Jenga tower. They keep baskets of the blocks on most tables, and it's a great time-kill while you wait for them to page you for your order. The folks working here are super-friendly, and the line was non-existent. Those of you who try to maintain a healthy diet during the work week, take note. ;-) From M-F until 7 pm, a $15 pitcher (or any alcohol purchase) gets you free fries! Even garlic fries! This is a great place to start a mid-week bar crawl, or to simply park yourself for an hour or so as you enjoy their incredible Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches ($7.50 / $8 with cheese). I can't get past the chipotle sauce on those - lots of subtle, wonderful heat. Load up on the free pickles! If there must be a flaw, it's that there is no on-premise bathroom, which is definitely a bummer. We were told "it's a bit of a trip" to get to, so we just ended up heading back to the Ferry Building. Oh wells. Also, there are several intrepid pigeons who will think nothing of lunging at your fries while you're actively eating them. Clapping and yelling will only make you look like an idiot. If this bothers you, best to sit inside. All said, this is a great stop, especially if you're looking to save some coin and recover from the sticker shock of Gott's. Pending another warm, beautiful evening, we'll be back!
My go to burger spot and favorite fast casual burger. I love that they're organic grass fed and cooked medium rare. There's always a long line to order but it moves relatively fast and the food comes pretty soon after. There's wine and beer on tap and free spiced pickles. Veggie burger is also pretty good and garlic fries are delicious. Ive been coming almost every Friday for a year and never get sick of it!
Yum! My go to place for burger and fries in the financial distirct! And why not play a game of janga while you're there? Relaxing spot for a burger in downtown SF. With both indoor and outdoor seating, visitors have the option to sit outside and enjoy the weather if it is nice.  The staff here are also great! Super duper nice (see what I did there?!)!
Since there was a huge conference going on at Moscone, my office couldn't find a Super Duper close to us that would take advance orders. (We're located Downtown.) That is, until they called the location on Mission at Spear. On Thursday, March 17th, we order lunch for pick up to celebrate St Patrick's Day.Since I'm not eating red meat for a while, I got the Chicken Sandwich: 100% natural free range chicken breast with chipotle aioli with with all The Free Stuff: Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Jalapeños, Grilled Onions and Housemade Pickles ($7.50), add Jack cheese (+$0.50), Roasted Portabello (+$1) and Organic Egg (+$1.50). I love Super Duper's burgers, but I can't say I feel the same about their chicken sandwich. The chicken was dry instead of being moist and tender. It may have suffered a bit from transit as the cheese had also hardened and the egg didn't provide the soft runny yolk I love. The pickles don't actually come in the burger, but Super Duper was nice enough to pack a to go container filled with pickles on the side.I did love the Garlic Fries: Fresh garlic & 6-month aged cheddar ($3.25) as usual. Though they did get a little soft and soggy in transit, I loved the garlicky and cheesy flavor. I decided to add Three Dips: Super Sauce, Housemade Mayo, Chipotle (+$1.50), but that may have been too much as the dips are very creamy and I believe mayo based. A touch of ketchup seemed to cut into the garlic fries better.I'm so glad this Super Duper was able to accommodate our big office order, but I found myself wishing I had ordered a burger instead of a chicken sandwich. Next time Super Duper, I will have one of your delicious cheeseburgers!
As tourists in San Francisco, we arrived here after heading eastwards, wandering in from Chinatown, on a Wednesday afternoon around 1:00 PM. It wasn't overtly busy, and we were able to grab ourselves a table.Service was decent, the garlic parmesan fries were absolutely delicious (a bit on the saltier side though), and the burger was perfectly juicy. If you're in the area, this isn't a bad option for a quick lunch, particularly if you're in a hurry.For a burger, garlic parmesan fries, and a chocolate shake, our total came to $17.30.
Always a good place to grab a quick burger in SF. It fits the guidelines of food quality in SF by being organic, grass-fed, and eco-friendly. I would recommend getting the Super Duper burger. Massive burger with two 4 oz patties with their special super sauce. If you're feeling in the mood to put on some calories and go on a sugar high the shakes are worth tryingl.
One of my favorite places for days when I'm craving for some not-so-healthy food. Absolutely love their burger with super sauce. My go-to meal? Mini burger with garlic fries. The garlic fries and be a hit or an almost-hit. They sometimes go a little bit overboard with the garlic sauce and the fries has a garlic-spicy taste. But most of the time, they're very excellent. They got great proportions on their burger, just the right amount of meat to bread. Not a huge lettuce fan, so I usually just get mine with cheese, super sauce, and tomato:) Their chicken sandwich is also very excellent, but the burger is my go-to.If you're feeling extra hungry, they also serve amazing milkshake and ice cream. However, most of the time, I'm too full after the burger and fries. My recommendation for milkshake: cookies & cream!
Ooooh typical Bay Area native alert but In n out is better. If you MUST have a burger in the financial district, Super Duper is the place to go. It's just a so-so burger that is a bit on the pricey side for what you get. Love the child portion milk shakes though. They're great when you got yourself a sweet tooth but are not trying to blow over your sugar limit for the day.
Super Duper Burger. Their shakes are made with skim milk so skip those. fries are edible and soda is the same type of fast food selection just cost more. they do have beer. and their tea is ok.Manager corrected below, but tastes like skim milk to me.I wont be back to that location, the others are so much better.
Friendly staff. Fresh burgers. Perfectly crisp fries with a soft center. We arrived before noon for lunch and it wasn't that busy, about one or two people were ordering ahead of us with two people working the registers. Tasha greeted each guest with a hello and asked if we had been there before. She said welcome back and proceeded to take our orders. She read my mind and gave me a cup for water after noticing the Starbucks in my hand. The burgers took about 7 minutes. Warm and juicy with a sesame seed bun equivalent to a mix of traditional dough/pretzel consistency. My only complaint is my roasted portobello mushrooms were cold. They weren't cooked with the burger, probably prepared beforehand. I like their garlic fries, but this time the amount of Parmesan overpowered the garlic. Unlimited pickles. I still haven't gotten a kids vanilla chocolate dipped cone (kids size is ok for adults too, as noted on their menu board).
Been here before. Burgers are decent. Unfortunately, garlic fries were cold. I never understood people who complained about cold food until today. There was 0% warmth in the fries. Either an arctic chill passed by in the 5 seconds it took to go from pick up to my seat or they served me cold fries. I'd guess the latter. I'm most annoyed that the servers served it to me. There's no way they weren't aware that the fries had been sitting there too long. It's too bad, I'm actually a fan of the burgers.
Grabbed a quick bite to eat before heading to the festivities. Very open and spacious with excellent service. It was very quick even during lunch hour. Fairly inexpensive and the doughnuts are just like the pier. The best part is the fresh side of pickles and jalapeños once you pick up your order. A little messy when you bite into your burger with all the fixings but it's a burger so chow down. Loved the food and the garlic fries are actually better than the ballpark. This is a hot spot so come early to beat the rush.
Wow I love this place so much, I'm a little bit ashamed I haven't written a review. When you go, here's what to get if you have amazing taste: cheeseburger with aged cheddar and everything on it, extra jalepenos, and a fried egg. For your side, the garlic parmesan fries and all the homemade pickles your heart desires. Just looking at the pictures of the food is making me a little koo-koo.You're welcome and enjoy.
