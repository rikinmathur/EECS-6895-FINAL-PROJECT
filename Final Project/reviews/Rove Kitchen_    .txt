Thank you Yelp for leading me to this heavenly place called Rove. The best burger, cooked perfectly!!!! The thin cut fries with to die for Aioli. And the Grilled Cheese, with honey on one side of the bred, oh my god, why didn't I think of that!!!!!Amazing, beautiful, delicious place. I'll dream about it until I go back!
Limited menu (burger, fried chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, fries, and bread pudding) but that just makes things easier to decide! Ordered everything but the grilled cheese and we were not disappointed. They recommend getting the burger medium rare so the burger comes out really juicy. I'm normally a medium well kind of gal but the rareness did not gross me out. The chicken sandwich was good with a hint of vinegar that gave it a nice tangy flavor. The fries were skinny and well seasoned but the garlic aioli was not super flavorful. Bread pudding was good but could only eat a few bites and had to pack it to go. Too full! Had dried figs and with a yummy cream on top. Generous portion so beware! TIP: sometimes they offer a salad (not on the menu) so just ask your server!
I went to Rove Kitchen with fellow yelper Elena N. to celebrate my birthday with a burger!  It used to be a tradition of mine to celebrate my birthday with a burger over at Lark Creek Steak, but that tradition broke when they closed last year.  When I read the reviews of Rove Kitchen, it looked like a good spot to continue my birthday burger tradition.Rove Burger -- bit.ly/1OyOnqzwith short rib blend, aged cheddar, onion jam, arugala, house made sesame bunOverall, I thought it was a solid burger.  The flavors were there and the burger was juicy and cooked the way I liked it.  But it didn't really blow me away like Lark Creek's Black Truffle Burger.  I'd probably order this burger again though if I visit Rove Kitchen again, and maybe throw an egg in there too.Fries with lemon garlic aioli. -- bit.ly/1PjAM5VThe fries were good and crispy and the lemon garlic aioli was a good pairing sauce for it.I also got to try some of Elena N.'s sandwiches that she ordered.Grilled Cheese -- bit.ly/1RYJTOswith Mt. Tam (Cowgirl Creamery), orange marmalade, sweet batard.Yeah, this Grilled Cheese sandwich tasted weird to me.  It was way too sweet for my palate and I understood that it wasn't meant to be a savory grilled cheese.  I'll pass on this next time.Fried Chicken Sandwich -- bit.ly/1UZuQU3with buttermilk fried chicken thigh, lemon anchovy aioli, cabbage slaw, pickles, sea salt bun.I actually thought this was the best thing I ate that night.  I'm always a sucker for fried chicken thighs, and the fact they use it for their sandwich made me and instant fan.  It was crispy and had a lot of flavor and it was all well put together with the pickles and slaw.Overall, I liked Rove Kitchen.  Although not everything was a hit for me, the Fried Chicken Sandwich alone was good enough for me to warrant another visit in the future.  I do want to come back and try their other dishes like their Cavatelli Pasta and Porchetta if they're still on the menu by then.  It's definitely a spot worth checking out if you're in the Union Square area.
With just a handful of items offered on the menu/chalkboard over the bar, they do these few items really well.  I went in with 2 choices already in mind and since they weren't offering any brunch items on Saturday, the burger and fried chicken sandwich were our picks.  With a huge saturation of chains into the gourmet burger market, I had yet to be wow'd by any of them to make it worth the extra dough it cost over a Five Guys for example and had just about given up on finding one to make it worthwhile.  Enter in Rove Kitchen where even though it is probably the most expensive burger I have eaten at $15, I may have just found the gourmet burger to win me over.  The house blend cooked medium served with arugula, aged cheddar, and sweet onion jam on a brioche bun blew Umami out of the water for me.  There was a bit of everything in each bite leaving you only wanting more of the delicious combination and not due to a lacking of flavor or ingredients.  The fried chicken sandwich was another winner, winner, chicken dinner, or in our case, I guess lunch.  The outside was perfectly crisp further enhanced by the crunch of the cabbage while the inside was so juicy that I kept checking whether it was fully cooked (it was) as I could not believe chicken could be that moist.  I would definitely get both of these again if I find myself in the area and the only reason it is a 4 star vs. a 5 is the price is on the high side for lunch.  If only this Rove Burger would meet the Umami price.
Small menu but everything was delicious. Small restaurant but its charming. Rustic modern.  We ordered almost everything on the menu that night except for the salad and nothing to really complain about. Services was friendly. Small place with counter top seats and around 7 tables. 2 servers last night. Thursday, April 28th's Menu and what was ordered. ** Rove burger - Short rib blend, aged cheddar, onion jam, house made sesame bun. Love the bun, crispy and soft. The burger is flavorful and the meat was tender. Adding a egg is recommended. A bit of sweet and savory. ** Fried chicken sandwich - Buttermilk fried chicken, cabbage slaw, pickles, lemon anchovy aioli, house made sea salt bun. The chicken wasn't dry. Wasn't over battered. Gave it a little cirtius kick with the lemon aioli. The burger was a lot tastier. ** Grilled cheese - Mt tam(cowgirl creamery), strawberry peach jam, sweet batard. Something different. It was slighty sweet. Like a french toast grilled cheese. So YUMMY! Also love the side salad.The dressing I really like. ** House Cut Fries - Roasted Garlic side with Aloli. It was tasty but I think we got the short end on this. My only complaint last night was the order of fries. They gave us what was left I believe of the batch. Barely any regular normal size ones, mostly short ends on the fries. Was a little disappointed. I am saving the best for last. Their "BREAD PUDDING"!! Serves with coconut gondola, salted caramel and mabel cream. WOW, might be one of the best I ever had. It's toasty, crunchy, soft and the perfect amount of sweetest in that bite. It's DELICIOUS! Recommend their BURGER and bread pudding! Must order. So glad I finally got the chance to try Rove. It was great!
I was looking for a good brunch spot that was close to the hotel my parents were staying. When we walked up, there were 2 parties in front of us so we decided to put our names down and wait - it was nice out. The decor is very light and clean looking, we ended up being seated at the bar area where we could easily look at the day's menu. The menu options are few, so just keep that in mind. Rove burger (5 stars): juicy, flavorful, and actually cooked to what I asked for! I've been looking for a burger that can satisfy my craving and this did it for me. The ingredients were fresh and they make their own buns which were soft and fluffy with a slight sweetness to the taste. What's great is that the burger is simple yet delicious and balanced so that you leave feeling like you just ate a grease bomb. The onion jam adds a ton of flavor and is countered by the light bitterness of the arugula.Yogurt Parfait (3.5 stars): Greek yogurt topped with granola and fruit. Not that you can really go wrong with yogurt.. and it was more than I would pay for yogurt, but they did give a fair volume of it. If you're looking for a light meal, it could be a pretty good option. Grilled cheese w/ gruyere (4 stars): I liked this variation on your standard grilled cheese and appreciated it being well smothered in butter and browned and served with the egg on top. Kind of wished this can come with some sort of side though. Overall I would say Rove was pretty good and the food is presented with intent. It was a little more than I would have expected but the food is made with fresh ingredients and cooked well. I would probably try to come for lunch or dinner in the future though.
Friday night, I was craving burgers and fries.  Came here around 8pm no line.  I was seated at the bar saving a seat while He was looking for parking.  Another party of 2 came by and I had to move.  Apparently you can't save seats if your whole party isn't present.  My bad, you should've told the server that.  Fast forward to the food.Rove Burger- Medium Rare, perfectly cooked, love arugula in a burgerFried Chicken Sandwich- Chicken was super moist, crispy batter, nice slawFries- thin, crispy, good dipping sauceNot everyone was on the same page in the beginning when it came to seating but the food, attentive service, and small chit chat about the Warriror's game (there's a TV on the left side where the bar section is) made up for it.  The overall presentation and taste of the dishes, excellent.
Had the most amazing grilled cheese ever at Rove Kitchen last night! It's a small and well-furnished simple kitchen and bar that serves a total of 6 food options which rotate occasionally: grilled cheese, hamburger, chicken sandwich, French fries, side salad, and bread pudding. We got the French fries, grilled cheese, and chicken sandwich. They also had a great selection of high quality beers on tap and wine. We sat at the bar and had a lovely time watching the end of the Golden State game and chatting with the bartender. Would love to go back again for that grilled cheese!
Dinner review. Short rib Burger - 4/5Fried chicken sandwich - 4/5Bread pudding - 5/5Overall, great bread pudding. "As good as it gets."
Rove Kitchen is the epitome of quality food and service with its small/limited menu of locally-sourced and seasonal menu items, depending on when you visit the menu items may or may not have changed. This is not a place where you're going to get a menu with a long dribbling list of options of entrees, but their seasonally changing menu is written on the chalkboard in the bar area. Whenever I visit smaller venues with such limited menu options, I get a little nervous. The end result can either be hit-or-miss. I ordered the Rove Burger, which is a short rib blend with aged-cheddar, carmelized onion jam, and arugula all on a house-made bun - Medium-rare. Let me tell you folks, this burger was juiccccccccy and worth every penny. The combination and layer of flavors & their fresh bread just made my tastebuds sing AND dance. So delightful! My friends ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with a brown butter red wine vinaigrette, lemon aioli, and slaw all on a sea-salt bun. They were so pleased with their sandwich & the flavors of their chicken sandwich packed a punch! Rove SF way to take on the classics and really live up to that "New American Dining" as advertised. Yum yum definitely in our tums!!Aesthetics & ambiance wise is very hip and modern. I really liked the overall feel of the place. Wooden tables. Chalkboard menu. Visible kitchen and thus amazing smells coming from said kitchen. Simple decor of plants on tables with glass bottles for water. While small, it didn't feel like you were going to feel claustrophobic. & Yes, Rove SF is definitely a small restaurant. It's not a place where you can easily grab a table for eight people and be able to sit together or be seated right away. But know this, my friends and I came with eight people - LOL I know, partially bad idea, but no regrets - and Rachel, our waitress/hostess was the most personable and accomodating  employee ever. Seriously, she was the bomb dot com. She kept us updated and always made jokes & would give us our options for seating arrangements if worse came to worse...our tables couldn't be next to each other WHICH btw did end up happening, but it worked out! Anyway, props to you Rachel you were soooo awesome!!!
I was taking Rodney H out for his birthday and he wanted a burger. I've read great things about Rove Kitchen's burger, so I suggested we check them out. I arrived Wednesday, January 13th a little before 6pm for dinner. There was only one other party seated, but since Rodney wasn't there yet, I had a drink at the bar while waiting. We ended up sitting at the bar for dinner as well.*Rove burger ($15): short rib blend, aged cheddar, caramelized onion jam, arugula, house made sesame bun*Grilled cheese ($10): Mt Tam (cowgirl creamery), orange marmalade, sweet batard, salad*Fried chicken sandwich ($13): buttermilk fried chicken, brown butter red wine vinaigrette, lemon aioli, slaw, sea salt bun*House cut fries ($5): garlic lemon aioli*Dolores saison ($9): 6.8% abv*Vino robles white ($13 glass): blend - voignier, verdelho, vermentino, sauvignon blanc*Baxter pinot noir ($14 glass x2)Hands down, one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had! The chicken was crispy, the slaw tangy, the aioli creamy. All encased in a soft savory bun. Sooo good! This is a must order when you come here.I had a bite of the much raved about burger and it was good, but I don't get the hype. The chicken sandwich was so much better. Maybe the brunch burger is better as it comes with an egg, but their dinner burger was just okay. I'd skip the grilled cheese as it didn't have enough cheese to qualify as a grilled cheese in my book. It seemed like equal parts cheese and marmalade which made for a very sweet sandwich. I didn't care for it.I like that Rove offers a limited menu at very reasonable prices, but I think their beer and wine should be comparable to that. Most glasses offered are priced more than the majority of their food items. I ended up spending more on alcohol than food. This does happen to me most of the time, but for a small place like this, I feel they should offer a red and a wine by the glass at lower price points.Rove kitchen would be a perfect quick lunch for their amazing chicken sandwich. For a full on dinner and drinks though, they are okay as there their menu is limited. But that chicken sandwich is definitely a must have in my book!
This place is a cute casual  little joint. You order off the chalkboard against the wall. Omg.. I had the best grilled cheese sandwich ever. It was so buttery, cheesy,sweet and savory. It's served with a side mixed green salad as well.  We also got the French fries . They were thinly sliced with a side of lemon anchovy aioli. It wasn't fishy at all so don't let the anchovy aioli freak you out.The coffee is really good here as well. I give this place 2 thumbs up!
4 stars strictly based on food that was TO GO!!I have never set foot in Rove kitchen, but I was lucky enough to have the pleasure of eating their food! My boyfriend was out eating with his friend here and brought me some food to go. He brought me the rove burger and the fried chicken sandwich, I ate half of each. OH. EM. GEE. It was heaven at first bite/party of the gods in my mouth!! I tasted the burger first because it looked so tasty and I couldn't believe a burger with no ketchup or sauce could taste so good! The arugula and the cheese were the perfect accents to bring out the flavor of this burger. I was about to forget about the chicken sandwich after tasting the burger because it was so good. But just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I took my first bite into the chicken sandwich. I was proven wrong. HOLY MOLY!!!!! What did I just taste???? EXTREME DELICIOUS-ness!! The chicken was still a little crispy on the edges and the cabbage and whatever vegetable was in there made the sandwich just pleasurable to eat. Although the chicken wasn't as crispy as I know it would be in the restaurant, the sandwich was still BOMB. And to top it all off....next came the DESSERT. One word: BLISS. Bread pudding with bourbon maple cream and blackberries. AHHHHHHH!!!!!! I took my first bite and automatically fell in love. The bourbon maple cream and buttery goodness of the bread was just heaven. The blackberries were THEE perfect topping. OMG. A dessert that seems so simple yet tastes so deliciously complex, bursting with flavor, I forgot all about the calories and just kept digging in :D How can I rate a restaurant 4 stars and never had set foot inside? BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS JUST. THAT. DAMN. GOOD. I see why Rove kitchen only has such a limited and small menu, they don't need any more items because the burger and sandwich alone is enough for someone to enjoy. Less is more. And the dessert!! MM MMM MMMMM. Because this food that I had to go was so DELICIOUS....I told my boyfriend that I will make it a point for to make a date night or lunch date here. I want to have the dine in experience and also taste the food when it's still fresh and HOT. I can just imagine how much more heavenly everything will taste!! I also want to take pictures of the food and atmosphere and post it here on my Yelp page cause that's what us yelpers love to do, right? :) Dear Rove Kitchen, I cannot wait to meet you in person and devour your food in pure satisfaction. Your bliss, deliciousness, and pleasure you bring to food lovers such as myself is so mind blowing it just doesn't make any sense. See you soon. Love, A food loving fat kid at heart.
This place has the BEST BURGER EVER. I was instantly surprised when I bit into it at how juicy and flavorful it was. It does come on the pricier side though - $15 for only the burger and no sides. The reason for the higher pricing is that all the ingredients are locally sourced. I also had the yogurt with fruits and candied nuts ($6) which was also great. Other things on the menu were the Chicken and waffles ($15), garlic potatoes ($8), and bread pudding ($6). I loved the layout of the place. It had an open kitchen type feel with seating at the bar as well as small tables next to the kitchen. The place is on the smaller side, seating only ~20 people. They also have limited opening hours Wednesday-Saturday11:30am-2:30pm; 5:30pm-10pm and Sunday brunch 8:30am-2:30pm - something to note if you are planning a visit.
This place is Yummy!!! I only go for the chicken sandwich because its super yummy! I dont need to try anything else.
The.BEST.burger.EVER! Been dreaming about it since the first bite... So in love! Pescatarian that was reincarnated... Pun intended!Gourmet gastropub menu (short rib burger, fried chick sandwich, grill cheese, salad, fries), small quality selection of wine and beer, low key no rez atmosphere = high value and 100% must try!!!*must note- one bad experience with service from a random waitress 1 of 2 visits but the burger is 5+ stars consistent and other service was fantastic.
This place is fantastic!First off, I hate when restaurants have a billion things on the menu and only a few things that are actually worth getting. Rove Kitchen takes the pain out of ordering because their menu is super limited, in a good way. There's also a separate beer/wine menu, also on a chalkboard, but we didn't try any.On the day I went, there were just these items on the chalkboard:Honey grilled cheeseBurgerFried chicken sandwichSide saladFriesSimple enough, right? My friends and I ordered everything except for the fried chicken sandwich, which I will be tossing and turning over until the next time I return. The burger was excellent: juicy, filling, and buttery without feeling too heavy. The brioche bun soaked up the juices and sauce perfectly. The grilled cheese was divine! I loved the runny egg on top and the honey made it sweet and savory all at once.Aside from the food, our waitress was cool and friendly and we enjoyed the laid-back, open atmosphere. Rove Kitchen is one of the less hyped brunch places, but it deserves all the stars.
I have eaten many meals in the bay area recently and found this based on reviews from yelp.First...the garlic fries are awesome...I had a seasonal tap stout beer from Barbary coast brewing that was  as well. Chicken sandwich was a 7 of 10...vibe was good and quick to be comfortable in..service was great...next time I will try the the grilled cheese...
Decor: 4/5-Limited seating for parties of 2-4-Enter through the east door and sign up for the waitlistService: 4/5-Be patient, there are a total of two servers-The food doesn't take terribly long, expect roughly 15-20 mins. Food: 4/5-only six items on the menu: rove burger, chicken sandwich, cheese sandwich, french toast, granola and bread pudding-French Toast was a solid 5/5. No questions or hesitation. The bread was just the right crunch with ample fresh fruits and two slices of bacon-Chicken Sandwich felt a bit underwhelming. You do get a thick, plump, dark meat chicken however the sauce was not to my liking and the chicken wasn't hot.
1. love the ambiance! 2. simple menu but perfect menuBurger was so good. Aged cheddar, sweet caramelized onions, meticulously prepared medium rare :) ALSO the bread pudding. I imagine the menu is seasonal and today, the bread pudding was pumpkin themed. But let me break down this bread pudding real quick - it's not your typical. Crispy but chewy warm squares of beautiful bread. Salty, sweet, drizzled in some heavenly syrup, overall well balanced in texture and flavor with fresh whipped cream, pepita seeds, dried berries. Left here very happy.
Thank you Yelp for leading me to this heavenly place called Rove. The best burger, cooked perfectly!!!! The thin cut fries with to die for Aioli. And the Grilled Cheese, with honey on one side of the bred, oh my god, why didn't I think of that!!!!!Amazing, beautiful, delicious place. I'll dream about it until I go back!

Small menu but everything was delicious. Small restaurant but its charming.

Had the most amazing grilled cheese ever at Rove Kitchen last night! It's a small and well-furnished simple kitchen and bar that serves a total of 6 food options which rotate occasionally: grilled cheese, hamburger, chicken sandwich, French fries, side salad, and bread pudding. We got the French fries, grilled cheese, and chicken sandwich. They also had a great selection of high quality beers on tap and wine. We sat at the bar and had a lovely time watching the end of the Golden State game and chatting with the bartender. Would love to go back again for that grilled cheese!

This is a must order when you come here.I had a bite of the much raved about burger and it was good, but I don't get the hype. The chicken sandwich was so much better. Maybe the brunch burger is better as it comes with an egg, but their dinner burger was just okay. I'd skip the grilled cheese as it didn't have enough cheese to qualify as a grilled cheese in my book. It seemed like equal parts cheese and marmalade which made for a very sweet sandwich. I didn't care for it.I like that Rove offers a limited menu at very reasonable prices, but I think their beer and wine should be comparable to that. Most glasses offered are priced more than the majority of their food items. I ended up spending more on alcohol than food. This does happen to me most of the time, but for a small place like this, I feel they should offer a red and a wine by the glass at lower price points.Rove kitchen would be a perfect quick lunch for their amazing chicken sandwich. For a full on dinner and drinks though, they are okay as there their menu is limited. But that chicken sandwich is definitely a must have in my book!
This place is a cute casual  little joint. You order off the chalkboard against the wall. Omg.. I had the best grilled cheese sandwich ever. It was so buttery, cheesy,sweet and savory. It's served with a side mixed green salad as well.  We also got the French fries . They were thinly sliced with a side of lemon anchovy aioli. It wasn't fishy at all so don't let the anchovy aioli freak you out.The coffee is really good here as well. I give this place 2 thumbs up!
4 stars strictly based on food that was TO GO!!I have never set foot in Rove kitchen, but I was lucky enough to have the pleasure of eating their food! My boyfriend was out eating with his friend here and brought me some food to go. He brought me the rove burger and the fried chicken sandwich, I ate half of each. OH. EM. GEE. It was heaven at first bite/party of the gods in my mouth!! I tasted the burger first because it looked so tasty and I couldn't believe a burger with no ketchup or sauce could taste so good! The arugula and the cheese were the perfect accents to bring out the flavor of this burger. I was about to forget about the chicken sandwich after tasting the burger because it was so good. But just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I took my first bite into the chicken sandwich. I was proven wrong. HOLY MOLY!!!!! What did I just taste???? EXTREME DELICIOUS-ness!! The chicken was still a little crispy on the edges and the cabbage and whatever vegetable was in there made the sandwich just pleasurable to eat. Although the chicken wasn't as crispy as I know it would be in the restaurant, the sandwich was still BOMB. And to top it all off....next came the DESSERT. One word: BLISS. Bread pudding with bourbon maple cream and blackberries. AHHHHHHH!!!!!! I took my first bite and automatically fell in love. The bourbon maple cream and buttery goodness of the bread was just heaven. The blackberries were THEE perfect topping. OMG. A dessert that seems so simple yet tastes so deliciously complex, bursting with flavor, I forgot all about the calories and just kept digging in :D How can I rate a restaurant 4 stars and never had set foot inside? BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS JUST. THAT. DAMN. GOOD. I see why Rove kitchen only has such a limited and small menu, they don't need any more items because the burger and sandwich alone is enough for someone to enjoy. Less is more. And the dessert!! MM MMM MMMMM. Because this food that I had to go was so DELICIOUS....I told my boyfriend that I will make it a point for to make a date night or lunch date here. I want to have the dine in experience and also taste the food when it's still fresh and HOT. I can just imagine how much more heavenly everything will taste!! I also want to take pictures of the food and atmosphere and post it here on my Yelp page cause that's what us yelpers love to do, right? :) Dear Rove Kitchen, I cannot wait to meet you in person and devour your food in pure satisfaction. Your bliss, deliciousness, and pleasure you bring to food lovers such as myself is so mind blowing it just doesn't make any sense. See you soon. Love, A food loving fat kid at heart.
This place has the BEST BURGER EVER. I was instantly surprised when I bit into it at how juicy and flavorful it was. It does come on the pricier side though - $15 for only the burger and no sides. The reason for the higher pricing is that all the ingredients are locally sourced. I also had the yogurt with fruits and candied nuts ($6) which was also great. Other things on the menu were the Chicken and waffles ($15), garlic potatoes ($8), and bread pudding ($6). I loved the layout of the place. It had an open kitchen type feel with seating at the bar as well as small tables next to the kitchen. The place is on the smaller side, seating only ~20 people. They also have limited opening hours Wednesday-Saturday11:30am-2:30pm; 5:30pm-10pm and Sunday brunch 8:30am-2:30pm - something to note if you are planning a visit.
This place is Yummy!!! I only go for the chicken sandwich because its super yummy! I dont need to try anything else.
The.BEST.burger.EVER! Been dreaming about it since the first bite... So in love! Pescatarian that was reincarnated... Pun intended!Gourmet gastropub menu (short rib burger, fried chick sandwich, grill cheese, salad, fries), small quality selection of wine and beer, low key no rez atmosphere = high value and 100% must try!!!*must note- one bad experience with service from a random waitress 1 of 2 visits but the burger is 5+ stars consistent and other service was fantastic.
This place is fantastic!First off, I hate when restaurants have a billion things on the menu and only a few things that are actually worth getting. Rove Kitchen takes the pain out of ordering because their menu is super limited, in a good way. There's also a separate beer/wine menu, also on a chalkboard, but we didn't try any.On the day I went, there were just these items on the chalkboard:Honey grilled cheeseBurgerFried chicken sandwichSide saladFriesSimple enough, right? My friends and I ordered everything except for the fried chicken sandwich, which I will be tossing and turning over until the next time I return. The burger was excellent: juicy, filling, and buttery without feeling too heavy. The brioche bun soaked up the juices and sauce perfectly. The grilled cheese was divine! I loved the runny egg on top and the honey made it sweet and savory all at once.Aside from the food, our waitress was cool and friendly and we enjoyed the laid-back, open atmosphere. Rove Kitchen is one of the less hyped brunch places, but it deserves all the stars.
I have eaten many meals in the bay area recently and found this based on reviews from yelp.First...the garlic fries are awesome...I had a seasonal tap stout beer from Barbary coast brewing that was  as well. Chicken sandwich was a 7 of 10...vibe was good and quick to be comfortable in..service was great...next time I will try the the grilled cheese...
Decor: 4/5-Limited seating for parties of 2-4-Enter through the east door and sign up for the waitlistService: 4/5-Be patient, there are a total of two servers-The food doesn't take terribly long, expect roughly 15-20 mins. Food: 4/5-only six items on the menu: rove burger, chicken sandwich, cheese sandwich, french toast, granola and bread pudding-French Toast was a solid 5/5. No questions or hesitation. The bread was just the right crunch with ample fresh fruits and two slices of bacon-Chicken Sandwich felt a bit underwhelming. You do get a thick, plump, dark meat chicken however the sauce was not to my liking and the chicken wasn't hot.
1. love the ambiance! 2. simple menu but perfect menuBurger was so good. Aged cheddar, sweet caramelized onions, meticulously prepared medium rare :) ALSO the bread pudding. I imagine the menu is seasonal and today, the bread pudding was pumpkin themed. But let me break down this bread pudding real quick - it's not your typical. Crispy but chewy warm squares of beautiful bread. Salty, sweet, drizzled in some heavenly syrup, overall well balanced in texture and flavor with fresh whipped cream, pepita seeds, dried berries. Left here very happy.
Thank you Yelp for leading me to this heavenly place called Rove. The best burger, cooked perfectly!!!! The thin cut fries with to die for Aioli. And the Grilled Cheese, with honey on one side of the bred, oh my god, why didn't I think of that!!!!!Amazing, beautiful, delicious place. I'll dream about it until I go back!
Limited menu (burger, fried chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, fries, and bread pudding) but that just makes things easier to decide! Ordered everything but the grilled cheese and we were not disappointed. They recommend getting the burger medium rare so the burger comes out really juicy. I'm normally a medium well kind of gal but the rareness did not gross me out. The chicken sandwich was good with a hint of vinegar that gave it a nice tangy flavor. The fries were skinny and well seasoned but the garlic aioli was not super flavorful. Bread pudding was good but could only eat a few bites and had to pack it to go. Too full! Had dried figs and with a yummy cream on top. Generous portion so beware! TIP: sometimes they offer a salad (not on the menu) so just ask your server!
I went to Rove Kitchen with fellow yelper Elena N. to celebrate my birthday with a burger!  It used to be a tradition of mine to celebrate my birthday with a burger over at Lark Creek Steak, but that tradition broke when they closed last year.  When I read the reviews of Rove Kitchen, it looked like a good spot to continue my birthday burger tradition.Rove Burger -- bit.ly/1OyOnqzwith short rib blend, aged cheddar, onion jam, arugala, house made sesame bunOverall, I thought it was a solid burger.  The flavors were there and the burger was juicy and cooked the way I liked it.  But it didn't really blow me away like Lark Creek's Black Truffle Burger.  I'd probably order this burger again though if I visit Rove Kitchen again, and maybe throw an egg in there too.Fries with lemon garlic aioli. -- bit.ly/1PjAM5VThe fries were good and crispy and the lemon garlic aioli was a good pairing sauce for it.I also got to try some of Elena N.'s sandwiches that she ordered.Grilled Cheese -- bit.ly/1RYJTOswith Mt. Tam (Cowgirl Creamery), orange marmalade, sweet batard.Yeah, this Grilled Cheese sandwich tasted weird to me.  It was way too sweet for my palate and I understood that it wasn't meant to be a savory grilled cheese.  I'll pass on this next time.Fried Chicken Sandwich -- bit.ly/1UZuQU3with buttermilk fried chicken thigh, lemon anchovy aioli, cabbage slaw, pickles, sea salt bun.I actually thought this was the best thing I ate that night.  I'm always a sucker for fried chicken thighs, and the fact they use it for their sandwich made me and instant fan.  It was crispy and had a lot of flavor and it was all well put together with the pickles and slaw.Overall, I liked Rove Kitchen.  Although not everything was a hit for me, the Fried Chicken Sandwich alone was good enough for me to warrant another visit in the future.  I do want to come back and try their other dishes like their Cavatelli Pasta and Porchetta if they're still on the menu by then.  It's definitely a spot worth checking out if you're in the Union Square area.
With just a handful of items offered on the menu/chalkboard over the bar, they do these few items really well.  I went in with 2 choices already in mind and since they weren't offering any brunch items on Saturday, the burger and fried chicken sandwich were our picks.  With a huge saturation of chains into the gourmet burger market, I had yet to be wow'd by any of them to make it worth the extra dough it cost over a Five Guys for example and had just about given up on finding one to make it worthwhile.  Enter in Rove Kitchen where even though it is probably the most expensive burger I have eaten at $15, I may have just found the gourmet burger to win me over.  The house blend cooked medium served with arugula, aged cheddar, and sweet onion jam on a brioche bun blew Umami out of the water for me.  There was a bit of everything in each bite leaving you only wanting more of the delicious combination and not due to a lacking of flavor or ingredients.  The fried chicken sandwich was another winner, winner, chicken dinner, or in our case, I guess lunch.  The outside was perfectly crisp further enhanced by the crunch of the cabbage while the inside was so juicy that I kept checking whether it was fully cooked (it was) as I could not believe chicken could be that moist.  I would definitely get both of these again if I find myself in the area and the only reason it is a 4 star vs. a 5 is the price is on the high side for lunch.  If only this Rove Burger would meet the Umami price.
Small menu but everything was delicious. Small restaurant but its charming. Rustic modern.  We ordered almost everything on the menu that night except for the salad and nothing to really complain about. Services was friendly. Small place with counter top seats and around 7 tables. 2 servers last night. Thursday, April 28th's Menu and what was ordered. ** Rove burger - Short rib blend, aged cheddar, onion jam, house made sesame bun. Love the bun, crispy and soft. The burger is flavorful and the meat was tender. Adding a egg is recommended. A bit of sweet and savory. ** Fried chicken sandwich - Buttermilk fried chicken, cabbage slaw, pickles, lemon anchovy aioli, house made sea salt bun. The chicken wasn't dry. Wasn't over battered. Gave it a little cirtius kick with the lemon aioli. The burger was a lot tastier. ** Grilled cheese - Mt tam(cowgirl creamery), strawberry peach jam, sweet batard. Something different. It was slighty sweet. Like a french toast grilled cheese. So YUMMY! Also love the side salad.The dressing I really like. ** House Cut Fries - Roasted Garlic side with Aloli. It was tasty but I think we got the short end on this. My only complaint last night was the order of fries. They gave us what was left I believe of the batch. Barely any regular normal size ones, mostly short ends on the fries. Was a little disappointed. I am saving the best for last. Their "BREAD PUDDING"!! Serves with coconut gondola, salted caramel and mabel cream. WOW, might be one of the best I ever had. It's toasty, crunchy, soft and the perfect amount of sweetest in that bite. It's DELICIOUS! Recommend their BURGER and bread pudding! Must order. So glad I finally got the chance to try Rove. It was great!
I was looking for a good brunch spot that was close to the hotel my parents were staying. When we walked up, there were 2 parties in front of us so we decided to put our names down and wait - it was nice out. The decor is very light and clean looking, we ended up being seated at the bar area where we could easily look at the day's menu. The menu options are few, so just keep that in mind. Rove burger (5 stars): juicy, flavorful, and actually cooked to what I asked for! I've been looking for a burger that can satisfy my craving and this did it for me. The ingredients were fresh and they make their own buns which were soft and fluffy with a slight sweetness to the taste. What's great is that the burger is simple yet delicious and balanced so that you leave feeling like you just ate a grease bomb. The onion jam adds a ton of flavor and is countered by the light bitterness of the arugula.Yogurt Parfait (3.5 stars): Greek yogurt topped with granola and fruit. Not that you can really go wrong with yogurt.. and it was more than I would pay for yogurt, but they did give a fair volume of it. If you're looking for a light meal, it could be a pretty good option. Grilled cheese w/ gruyere (4 stars): I liked this variation on your standard grilled cheese and appreciated it being well smothered in butter and browned and served with the egg on top. Kind of wished this can come with some sort of side though. Overall I would say Rove was pretty good and the food is presented with intent. It was a little more than I would have expected but the food is made with fresh ingredients and cooked well. I would probably try to come for lunch or dinner in the future though.
Friday night, I was craving burgers and fries.  Came here around 8pm no line.  I was seated at the bar saving a seat while He was looking for parking.  Another party of 2 came by and I had to move.  Apparently you can't save seats if your whole party isn't present.  My bad, you should've told the server that.  Fast forward to the food.Rove Burger- Medium Rare, perfectly cooked, love arugula in a burgerFried Chicken Sandwich- Chicken was super moist, crispy batter, nice slawFries- thin, crispy, good dipping sauceNot everyone was on the same page in the beginning when it came to seating but the food, attentive service, and small chit chat about the Warriror's game (there's a TV on the left side where the bar section is) made up for it.  The overall presentation and taste of the dishes, excellent.
Had the most amazing grilled cheese ever at Rove Kitchen last night! It's a small and well-furnished simple kitchen and bar that serves a total of 6 food options which rotate occasionally: grilled cheese, hamburger, chicken sandwich, French fries, side salad, and bread pudding. We got the French fries, grilled cheese, and chicken sandwich. They also had a great selection of high quality beers on tap and wine. We sat at the bar and had a lovely time watching the end of the Golden State game and chatting with the bartender. Would love to go back again for that grilled cheese!
Dinner review. Short rib Burger - 4/5Fried chicken sandwich - 4/5Bread pudding - 5/5Overall, great bread pudding. "As good as it gets."
Rove Kitchen is the epitome of quality food and service with its small/limited menu of locally-sourced and seasonal menu items, depending on when you visit the menu items may or may not have changed. This is not a place where you're going to get a menu with a long dribbling list of options of entrees, but their seasonally changing menu is written on the chalkboard in the bar area. Whenever I visit smaller venues with such limited menu options, I get a little nervous. The end result can either be hit-or-miss. I ordered the Rove Burger, which is a short rib blend with aged-cheddar, carmelized onion jam, and arugula all on a house-made bun - Medium-rare. Let me tell you folks, this burger was juiccccccccy and worth every penny. The combination and layer of flavors & their fresh bread just made my tastebuds sing AND dance. So delightful! My friends ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with a brown butter red wine vinaigrette, lemon aioli, and slaw all on a sea-salt bun. They were so pleased with their sandwich & the flavors of their chicken sandwich packed a punch! Rove SF way to take on the classics and really live up to that "New American Dining" as advertised. Yum yum definitely in our tums!!Aesthetics & ambiance wise is very hip and modern. I really liked the overall feel of the place. Wooden tables. Chalkboard menu. Visible kitchen and thus amazing smells coming from said kitchen. Simple decor of plants on tables with glass bottles for water. While small, it didn't feel like you were going to feel claustrophobic. & Yes, Rove SF is definitely a small restaurant. It's not a place where you can easily grab a table for eight people and be able to sit together or be seated right away. But know this, my friends and I came with eight people - LOL I know, partially bad idea, but no regrets - and Rachel, our waitress/hostess was the most personable and accomodating  employee ever. Seriously, she was the bomb dot com. She kept us updated and always made jokes & would give us our options for seating arrangements if worse came to worse...our tables couldn't be next to each other WHICH btw did end up happening, but it worked out! Anyway, props to you Rachel you were soooo awesome!!!
I was taking Rodney H out for his birthday and he wanted a burger. I've read great things about Rove Kitchen's burger, so I suggested we check them out. I arrived Wednesday, January 13th a little before 6pm for dinner. There was only one other party seated, but since Rodney wasn't there yet, I had a drink at the bar while waiting. We ended up sitting at the bar for dinner as well.*Rove burger ($15): short rib blend, aged cheddar, caramelized onion jam, arugula, house made sesame bun*Grilled cheese ($10): Mt Tam (cowgirl creamery), orange marmalade, sweet batard, salad*Fried chicken sandwich ($13): buttermilk fried chicken, brown butter red wine vinaigrette, lemon aioli, slaw, sea salt bun*House cut fries ($5): garlic lemon aioli*Dolores saison ($9): 6.8% abv*Vino robles white ($13 glass): blend - voignier, verdelho, vermentino, sauvignon blanc*Baxter pinot noir ($14 glass x2)Hands down, one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had!

With just a handful of items offered on the menu/chalkboard over the bar, they do these few items really well.  I went in with 2 choices already in mind and since they weren't offering any brunch items on Saturday, the burger and fried chicken sandwich were our picks.  With a huge saturation of chains into the gourmet burger market, I had yet to be wow'd by any of them to make it worth the extra dough it cost over a Five Guys for example and had just about given up on finding one to make it worthwhile.  Enter in Rove Kitchen where even though it is probably the most expensive burger I have eaten at $15, I may have just found the gourmet burger to win me over.  The house blend cooked medium served with arugula, aged cheddar, and sweet onion jam on a brioche bun blew Umami out of the water for me.  There was a bit of everything in each bite leaving you only wanting more of the delicious combination and not due to a lacking of flavor or ingredients.  The fried chicken sandwich was another winner, winner, chicken dinner, or in our case, I guess lunch.  The outside was perfectly crisp further enhanced by the crunch of the cabbage while the inside was so juicy that I kept checking whether it was fully cooked (it was) as I could not believe chicken could be that moist.  I would definitely get both of these again if I find myself in the area and the only reason it is a 4 star vs. a 5 is the price is on the high side for lunch.  If only this Rove Burger would meet the Umami price.
Small menu but everything was delicious. Small restaurant but its charming. Rustic modern.  We ordered almost everything on the menu that night except for the salad and nothing to really complain about. Services was friendly. Small place with counter top seats and around 7 tables. 2 servers last night. Thursday, April 28th's Menu and what was ordered. ** Rove burger - Short rib blend, aged cheddar, onion jam, house made sesame bun. Love the bun, crispy and soft. The burger is flavorful and the meat was tender. Adding a egg is recommended. A bit of sweet and savory. ** Fried chicken sandwich - Buttermilk fried chicken, cabbage slaw, pickles, lemon anchovy aioli, house made sea salt bun. The chicken wasn't dry. Wasn't over battered. Gave it a little cirtius kick with the lemon aioli. The burger was a lot tastier. ** Grilled cheese - Mt tam(cowgirl creamery), strawberry peach jam, sweet batard. Something different. It was slighty sweet. Like a french toast grilled cheese. So YUMMY! Also love the side salad.The dressing I really like. ** House Cut Fries - Roasted Garlic side with Aloli. It was tasty but I think we got the short end on this. My only complaint last night was the order of fries. They gave us what was left I believe of the batch. Barely any regular normal size ones, mostly short ends on the fries. Was a little disappointed. I am saving the best for last. Their "BREAD PUDDING"!! Serves with coconut gondola, salted caramel and mabel cream. WOW, might be one of the best I ever had. It's toasty, crunchy, soft and the perfect amount of sweetest in that bite. It's DELICIOUS! Recommend their BURGER and bread pudding! Must order. So glad I finally got the chance to try Rove. It was great!
I was looking for a good brunch spot that was close to the hotel my parents were staying. When we walked up, there were 2 parties in front of us so we decided to put our names down and wait - it was nice out. The decor is very light and clean looking, we ended up being seated at the bar area where we could easily look at the day's menu. The menu options are few, so just keep that in mind. Rove burger (5 stars): juicy, flavorful, and actually cooked to what I asked for! I've been looking for a burger that can satisfy my craving and this did it for me. The ingredients were fresh and they make their own buns which were soft and fluffy with a slight sweetness to the taste. What's great is that the burger is simple yet delicious and balanced so that you leave feeling like you just ate a grease bomb. The onion jam adds a ton of flavor and is countered by the light bitterness of the arugula.Yogurt Parfait (3.5 stars): Greek yogurt topped with granola and fruit. Not that you can really go wrong with yogurt.. and it was more than I would pay for yogurt, but they did give a fair volume of it. If you're looking for a light meal, it could be a pretty good option. Grilled cheese w/ gruyere (4 stars): I liked this variation on your standard grilled cheese and appreciated it being well smothered in butter and browned and served with the egg on top. Kind of wished this can come with some sort of side though. Overall I would say Rove was pretty good and the food is presented with intent. It was a little more than I would have expected but the food is made with fresh ingredients and cooked well. I would probably try to come for lunch or dinner in the future though.
Friday night, I was craving burgers and fries.  Came here around 8pm no line.  I was seated at the bar saving a seat while He was looking for parking.  Another party of 2 came by and I had to move.  Apparently you can't save seats if your whole party isn't present.  My bad, you should've told the server that.  Fast forward to the food.Rove Burger- Medium Rare, perfectly cooked, love arugula in a burgerFried Chicken Sandwich- Chicken was super moist, crispy batter, nice slawFries- thin, crispy, good dipping sauceNot everyone was on the same page in the beginning when it came to seating but the food, attentive service, and small chit chat about the Warriror's game (there's a TV on the left side where the bar section is) made up for it.  The overall presentation and taste of the dishes, excellent.
Had the most amazing grilled cheese ever at Rove Kitchen last night! It's a small and well-furnished simple kitchen and bar that serves a total of 6 food options which rotate occasionally: grilled cheese, hamburger, chicken sandwich, French fries, side salad, and bread pudding. We got the French fries, grilled cheese, and chicken sandwich. They also had a great selection of high quality beers on tap and wine. We sat at the bar and had a lovely time watching the end of the Golden State game and chatting with the bartender. Would love to go back again for that grilled cheese!
Dinner review. Short rib Burger - 4/5Fried chicken sandwich - 4/5Bread pudding - 5/5Overall, great bread pudding. "As good as it gets."
Rove Kitchen is the epitome of quality food and service with its small/limited menu of locally-sourced and seasonal menu items, depending on when you visit the menu items may or may not have changed. This is not a place where you're going to get a menu with a long dribbling list of options of entrees, but their seasonally changing menu is written on the chalkboard in the bar area. Whenever I visit smaller venues with such limited menu options, I get a little nervous. The end result can either be hit-or-miss. I ordered the Rove Burger, which is a short rib blend with aged-cheddar, carmelized onion jam, and arugula all on a house-made bun - Medium-rare. Let me tell you folks, this burger was juiccccccccy and worth every penny. The combination and layer of flavors & their fresh bread just made my tastebuds sing AND dance. So delightful! My friends ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with a brown butter red wine vinaigrette, lemon aioli, and slaw all on a sea-salt bun. They were so pleased with their sandwich & the flavors of their chicken sandwich packed a punch! Rove SF way to take on the classics and really live up to that "New American Dining" as advertised. Yum yum definitely in our tums!!Aesthetics & ambiance wise is very hip and modern. I really liked the overall feel of the place. Wooden tables. Chalkboard menu. Visible kitchen and thus amazing smells coming from said kitchen. Simple decor of plants on tables with glass bottles for water. While small, it didn't feel like you were going to feel claustrophobic. & Yes, Rove SF is definitely a small restaurant. It's not a place where you can easily grab a table for eight people and be able to sit together or be seated right away. But know this, my friends and I came with eight people - LOL I know, partially bad idea, but no regrets - and Rachel, our waitress/hostess was the most personable and accomodating  employee ever. Seriously, she was the bomb dot com. She kept us updated and always made jokes & would give us our options for seating arrangements if worse came to worse...our tables couldn't be next to each other WHICH btw did end up happening, but it worked out! Anyway, props to you Rachel you were soooo awesome!!!
I was taking Rodney H out for his birthday and he wanted a burger. I've read great things about Rove Kitchen's burger, so I suggested we check them out. I arrived Wednesday, January 13th a little before 6pm for dinner. There was only one other party seated, but since Rodney wasn't there yet, I had a drink at the bar while waiting. We ended up sitting at the bar for dinner as well.*Rove burger ($15): short rib blend, aged cheddar, caramelized onion jam, arugula, house made sesame bun*Grilled cheese ($10): Mt Tam (cowgirl creamery), orange marmalade, sweet batard, salad*Fried chicken sandwich ($13): buttermilk fried chicken, brown butter red wine vinaigrette, lemon aioli, slaw, sea salt bun*House cut fries ($5): garlic lemon aioli*Dolores saison ($9): 6.8% abv*Vino robles white ($13 glass): blend - voignier, verdelho, vermentino, sauvignon blanc*Baxter pinot noir ($14 glass x2)Hands down, one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had! The chicken was crispy, the slaw tangy, the aioli creamy. All encased in a soft savory bun. Sooo good! This is a must order when you come here.I had a bite of the much raved about burger and it was good, but I don't get the hype. The chicken sandwich was so much better. Maybe the brunch burger is better as it comes with an egg, but their dinner burger was just okay. I'd skip the grilled cheese as it didn't have enough cheese to qualify as a grilled cheese in my book. It seemed like equal parts cheese and marmalade which made for a very sweet sandwich. I didn't care for it.I like that Rove offers a limited menu at very reasonable prices, but I think their beer and wine should be comparable to that. Most glasses offered are priced more than the majority of their food items. I ended up spending more on alcohol than food. This does happen to me most of the time, but for a small place like this, I feel they should offer a red and a wine by the glass at lower price points.Rove kitchen would be a perfect quick lunch for their amazing chicken sandwich. For a full on dinner and drinks though, they are okay as there their menu is limited. But that chicken sandwich is definitely a must have in my book!
This place is a cute casual  little joint. You order off the chalkboard against the wall. Omg.. I had the best grilled cheese sandwich ever. It was so buttery, cheesy,sweet and savory. It's served with a side mixed green salad as well.  We also got the French fries . They were thinly sliced with a side of lemon anchovy aioli. It wasn't fishy at all so don't let the anchovy aioli freak you out.The coffee is really good here as well. I give this place 2 thumbs up!
4 stars strictly based on food that was TO GO!!I have never set foot in Rove kitchen, but I was lucky enough to have the pleasure of eating their food! My boyfriend was out eating with his friend here and brought me some food to go. He brought me the rove burger and the fried chicken sandwich, I ate half of each. OH. EM. GEE. It was heaven at first bite/party of the gods in my mouth!! I tasted the burger first because it looked so tasty and I couldn't believe a burger with no ketchup or sauce could taste so good! The arugula and the cheese were the perfect accents to bring out the flavor of this burger. I was about to forget about the chicken sandwich after tasting the burger because it was so good. But just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I took my first bite into the chicken sandwich. I was proven wrong. HOLY MOLY!!!!! What did I just taste???? EXTREME DELICIOUS-ness!! The chicken was still a little crispy on the edges and the cabbage and whatever vegetable was in there made the sandwich just pleasurable to eat. Although the chicken wasn't as crispy as I know it would be in the restaurant, the sandwich was still BOMB. And to top it all off....next came the DESSERT. One word: BLISS. Bread pudding with bourbon maple cream and blackberries. AHHHHHHH!!!!!! I took my first bite and automatically fell in love. The bourbon maple cream and buttery goodness of the bread was just heaven. The blackberries were THEE perfect topping. OMG. A dessert that seems so simple yet tastes so deliciously complex, bursting with flavor, I forgot all about the calories and just kept digging in :D How can I rate a restaurant 4 stars and never had set foot inside? BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS JUST. THAT. DAMN. GOOD. I see why Rove kitchen only has such a limited and small menu, they don't need any more items because the burger and sandwich alone is enough for someone to enjoy. Less is more. And the dessert!! MM MMM MMMMM. Because this food that I had to go was so DELICIOUS....I told my boyfriend that I will make it a point for to make a date night or lunch date here. I want to have the dine in experience and also taste the food when it's still fresh and HOT. I can just imagine how much more heavenly everything will taste!! I also want to take pictures of the food and atmosphere and post it here on my Yelp page cause that's what us yelpers love to do, right? :) Dear Rove Kitchen, I cannot wait to meet you in person and devour your food in pure satisfaction. Your bliss, deliciousness, and pleasure you bring to food lovers such as myself is so mind blowing it just doesn't make any sense. See you soon. Love, A food loving fat kid at heart.
This place has the BEST BURGER EVER. I was instantly surprised when I bit into it at how juicy and flavorful it was. It does come on the pricier side though - $15 for only the burger and no sides. The reason for the higher pricing is that all the ingredients are locally sourced. I also had the yogurt with fruits and candied nuts ($6) which was also great. Other things on the menu were the Chicken and waffles ($15), garlic potatoes ($8), and bread pudding ($6). I loved the layout of the place. It had an open kitchen type feel with seating at the bar as well as small tables next to the kitchen. The place is on the smaller side, seating only ~20 people. They also have limited opening hours Wednesday-Saturday11:30am-2:30pm; 5:30pm-10pm and Sunday brunch 8:30am-2:30pm - something to note if you are planning a visit.
This place is Yummy!!! I only go for the chicken sandwich because its super yummy! I dont need to try anything else.
The.BEST.burger.EVER! Been dreaming about it since the first bite... So in love! Pescatarian that was reincarnated... Pun intended!Gourmet gastropub menu (short rib burger, fried chick sandwich, grill cheese, salad, fries), small quality selection of wine and beer, low key no rez atmosphere = high value and 100% must try!!!*must note- one bad experience with service from a random waitress 1 of 2 visits but the burger is 5+ stars consistent and other service was fantastic.
This place is fantastic!First off, I hate when restaurants have a billion things on the menu and only a few things that are actually worth getting. Rove Kitchen takes the pain out of ordering because their menu is super limited, in a good way. There's also a separate beer/wine menu, also on a chalkboard, but we didn't try any.On the day I went, there were just these items on the chalkboard:Honey grilled cheeseBurgerFried chicken sandwichSide saladFriesSimple enough, right? My friends and I ordered everything except for the fried chicken sandwich, which I will be tossing and turning over until the next time I return. The burger was excellent: juicy, filling, and buttery without feeling too heavy. The brioche bun soaked up the juices and sauce perfectly. The grilled cheese was divine! I loved the runny egg on top and the honey made it sweet and savory all at once.Aside from the food, our waitress was cool and friendly and we enjoyed the laid-back, open atmosphere. Rove Kitchen is one of the less hyped brunch places, but it deserves all the stars.
I have eaten many meals in the bay area recently and found this based on reviews from yelp.First...the garlic fries are awesome...I had a seasonal tap stout beer from Barbary coast brewing that was  as well. Chicken sandwich was a 7 of 10...vibe was good and quick to be comfortable in..service was great...next time I will try the the grilled cheese...
Decor: 4/5-Limited seating for parties of 2-4-Enter through the east door and sign up for the waitlistService: 4/5-Be patient, there are a total of two servers-The food doesn't take terribly long, expect roughly 15-20 mins. Food: 4/5-only six items on the menu: rove burger, chicken sandwich, cheese sandwich, french toast, granola and bread pudding-French Toast was a solid 5/5. No questions or hesitation. The bread was just the right crunch with ample fresh fruits and two slices of bacon-Chicken Sandwich felt a bit underwhelming. You do get a thick, plump, dark meat chicken however the sauce was not to my liking and the chicken wasn't hot.
1. love the ambiance! 2. simple menu but perfect menuBurger was so good. Aged cheddar, sweet caramelized onions, meticulously prepared medium rare :) ALSO the bread pudding. I imagine the menu is seasonal and today, the bread pudding was pumpkin themed. But let me break down this bread pudding real quick - it's not your typical. Crispy but chewy warm squares of beautiful bread. Salty, sweet, drizzled in some heavenly syrup, overall well balanced in texture and flavor with fresh whipped cream, pepita seeds, dried berries. Left here very happy.
