Can't beat the .25 wings. They were tasty, hot and good size. Happy hour specials were very good too. Who knew I could get 3 whiskey mixed drinks, and 18 wings for $25 in San Francisco??? I would classify it as a dive, but that's what I like. The bartender/owner and staff were ultra friendly and the customers were equally sociable. That is nice when you are an out of towner traveling alone on business.I will go back.
I had high hopes as I had come here before and enjoyed the ambience. I came here this afternoon and the owner told me they only had one cook. That's cool. 20 minutes for food I can deal with that. But then I after waiting for almost an hour while everyone around me got their food I got pretty bummed. Then the bartender totally dissed me when I asked about my food. "We have one cook and he is doing the best he can." "It's been almost an hour?"Looks seats dismissively. No sorry no nothing. Meanwhile the dude next to me who came 20 minutes after me gets wings and the guys seating next to me who ordered right before me gets his food after 10 minutes and finished it way before anyone even checked on me. Then they offered me some stale chips.  they comped my bottomless mimosas but I never got my food. All in all it was a bummer.
I'll preface this review by mentioning that I live in the building above Ho's. This is basically my "living room". That said, I'm fairly particular when it comes to my drinking establishments (even when they happen to be right underneath my feet). From the beginning, the bartenders and owners of Ho's have been incredibly friendly and welcoming. This is the type of place where you'll never meet a stranger. Ho's also has a robust bar bites menu. Some of my personal favorites include the pulled pork sliders, Ramen (from 12-3 am only) and the burger with waffle fries. And if you really wanna go all out, they even have deep fried oreos with vanilla ice cream!As for the drinks, I'm still waiting on them to add the "Z-Train" Pimm's Cup. From my understanding, that one is still in the development stage, but no doubt soon to be a hit. In all seriousness, strong pours and tasty concoctions are the standard here. Do yourself a favor and get your drinky drink on at Ho's. In a city with a new bar or restaurant opening every week, this is exactly the type of institution that will stand the test of time. Good people, good food (with a fantastic late night menu) and stiff drinks. The trifecta!
The co-owner of Ho's, Masaye, was SO helpful in prepping the best birthday celebration for me at Ho's Bootleg Tavern! Leading up the event, she was very reachable and communicative and offered to reserve a great area for me and plan for a specialty drink. When we arrived at the bar for the party, she was there to say hello and happy birthday, so sweet! We loved the signs on the tables and the specialty drink called Birthday Baloo after my dog was a huge hit. It was a Moscow Mule with a splash of St. Germain, so delicious and dangerous! A lot of them even came in the Mule special copper cups until they ran out since so many people were ordering them. I'm excited to come back to Ho's Bootleg Tavern!P.S. Did I mention they are now serving food that sounds very yummy and have Big Buck Hunter?!
Good neighborhood bar located just a block from Polk Street. I met a friend here for a drink on a Monday evening when the Warriors were playing. It was crowded but there was still a lot of space to sit. The bartenders were friendly and quick and making drinks. The drinks were reasonably priced, mostly between $9-10. I enjoyed the citrus vodka drink and the old fashioned. I'd recommend if you're looking for a bar in the area.
Great corner bar. tons of windows and the staff is pleasant, imagine that!
This part of town needed this spot!  Great local pub concept run by a group of people who know the business, and more importantly love the business.  The menu items are hard to beat (get.the.wings.) and a great crop of brews too.  Now serving brunch, boom!
Best new bar in the city.  Great food, Amazing bartenders. 25 cent wings from 5pm-7pm EVERYDAY!!!
Hands down one of the best bars in the city! Staff is incredibly friendly but more importantly fast and attentive. They make great drinks and have a bunch of beers on tap and a ton of awesome Whiskey options. In a city that lacks Sports Bars this place nails it and with the layout/TV's is the perfect place to watch Warriors games or any other sports. The best part might possibly be the food: Crazy good burger, the calamari, bacon 3 ways and other appetizers were off the hook and I've got 3 words: Deep Fried Oreos! Maybe most important? Kitchen open til 3am on the weekends!!! Late night Ramen is unreal and this place is easily the best late night food around.
I was here after a long night out. Honestly the best service and food you could imagine on a Thursday night at 1 AM, and they open til 3. Been here a few times for the sports games and it's always fun and lively. The staff is amazing.
Deep fried oreos, lots of TV's for sports games, crunchy fried chicken bites, STRONG Kentucky Mules, and great playlists. What more could you want in a bar? Congrats to Jerrid on a successful bar launch! This one will become a staple in the Marina/ Russian Hill community
I love this place! I've been waiting for a cool bar that serves yummy foods to pop up for a while now, and Ho's Bootleg Tavern is just what I've been waiting for. Not only do they have your usual drinks, they have an amazing fancy cocktail menu. On top of that, their food menus is unique, tasty and comes in huge portions for a really reasonable price. It's definitely better than your average greasy bar food. The service is great; bartender is friendly and attentive. This place is great for groups, date night with the girlfriends....and hubby. :)
$0.25 wings and $3.00 beers for happy hour sure made us happy! I also enjoyed the large windows, the place wasn't dark.
Food amazing for a bar even outside a bar the appetizers are off the chain.  The crowd and music Make the environment lively and fun. Absolute must because you'll want to stay.
Came in here Fri evening. UNBELIEVABLE service. The staff is so kind and welcoming, Ivan & Jared are amazing. We ordered some food and cocktails, all of which were delicious! Looking forward to going back!
Great new bar on the block. Jared knows his stuff. My favorite drink is a Paloma- and he made the best "quick" non-craft Paloma I've had here in SF. Also food is on point for late night. Definitely planning to make this a regular spot.
This is my new favorite place!  Close to my apt and It's got my vote for best dive bar in SF by far! Great food and cocktails. I had the 25 cent BBQ wings and the pulled pork sliders, both were awesome. I'm here for my second time and just burned thru a bunch of wings.  On my second old fashioned and just ordered a 'It's Better with Butter Burger".  I expect to be a regular here, thanks for keeping the dive bar alive!
This bar has an awesome atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty food. It's great that not only is it close to where I live in Nob Hill but the staff are super cool to chat up with. Definitely coming back here! Keep up the good work guys!
Awesome place, Ivan is a great bartender and can add an improvement to any traditional drink! Ceviche and calamari are amazing!
Stopped in here on a recent trip to SF.  The sliders and wings were good - bartenders were cool.
