We stopped into Hot Spud for lunch while wandering around the shops near Fisherman's Wharf and had a decent bite to eat.Décor: It's a small shop with just a few seats to stay and eat, most seemed to grab and go, but it's clean and flooded with natural light. The ambiance is chill and relaxed and it's a nice change from all the tourists wandering around outside. The menu is large and can't be missed and there was not a large line at all when we were there. In fact, it was very quiet (not sure why).Bathroom: unknownStaff: Everyone was nice and friendly, willing to help with any questions.Food: The potato was PERFECTLY cooked and delicious! I had the buffalo chicken one and it was very, very tasty. I just had it as it comes and a cup of free water. It was a solid little lunch that filled me up pretty well indeed.Value: The do not overprice their spuds here. You leave with a satisfied belly and a wallet that still has some cash in it.I enjoyed this lunch spot and would return in the future. However, I'd try a few more places first.
Really cool idea for a restaurant. Execution was just a wee bit weak though. Potato wasn't especially great. It's San Francisco, I just can't imagine needing to go here with so many places around the Fisherman's Wharf area. It's not that much cheaper than the other nearby restaurants either. I will say though it's fun. And totally worth coming up with your own fun combination. Go with friends. Make it fun. Just don't expect really top notch quality. It's just good.
San Francisco has an embarrassment of great eating experiences. The competitive dining environment as well as the enormous food choices in the city, mean that if an establishment is not delivering a high quality product, it will not be long before the word gets out, and the eatery will either improve or fold. Hot Spud gets that all to well. A cozy location blocks from the pier means it sees a lot of foot traffic, but being just off the pier, it can be missed. Someone decided to take me there and I was not disappointed, in fact the first taste of my gourmet steak potato was pure delight. The ingredients are fresh, the steak tender,and all the toppings add to an incredible offering.
Get your potato on! I was walking the streets of Fisherman's Wharf, looking for a non fussy and quick place to grab a bite when their logo caught my eye. I am a fan of everything with potato and it looked like they had interesting toppings to go with it. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. I got chipotle shrimp hot spud. I only wished there was a little more cheese on it. But maybe it was healthier that way? I really enjoyed the skin of my spud. It was lightly salted and chewy. I really recommend to stop by here if you are in the area and feel like getting something different than your typical FW chowder and seafood.
Cheesy, buttery, fatty baked potato goodness!  Our office had Hot Spuds catered to us through Chewse and it was delish!  They accommodated for those who are dairy free and vegan as well, and offered greens for a no carb option.  The potatoes were served piping hot and were huge.    They were moist too.  Loved the make your own potato bar.  Topped mine off with sour cream, chives, some feta cheese, grilled chicken and beef, tomatoes, sautéed mushrooms and bell peppers.  The meats were well seasoned.  The toppings were fresh and pleased everyone's palettes.  It was a very filling and tasty lunch.  I just wished that they also offered more sauces (only had a thousand island like sauce and buffalo sauce) or a Greek yogurt option substitute for sour cream.
Fisherman's Wharf I can assume is known as a tourist trap.  With that, the MAJORITY (not all, hold your horses!) of the food may or may not be mediocre at best with exorbitant prices.  I mean, I just walked around at 2000 on a Friday night and honestly, I was amazed at how empty most of the establishments were (is it the time of the year?  Educate me locals, I am ignorant!). I was walking towards the "Wharf" and I stumbled upon this place.  It looked unique.  I hadn't had a decent potato in a while, so I figured what the hell, why not.  This place was also not crowded at all...It is a small place, with about 5 tables, a 5 person bar, and a community table (UYE, anyone?!?!).  They have a vast bottled drink collection ranging from Coke products to craft sodas to beers.They have different premade spuds that have a chicken, steak, shrimp, veggie, or crab base.  They also have a create your own option.  That is what I did.I told the lady I wanted steak, wing sauce, sour cream, croutons, and extra cheese.  A few minutes later, it was my time to pick it up.  I do not think the picture does it justice.  Thankfully, I ate all of mine.  It was unique to say the least.  The inside was creamy while the skin was crispy.  Thankfully the provided knife cut right through and did not cut through the "plate".  I ended up eating it all.  With the Coke I got, it was just over $13.  They also have desserts as well I was told they are worth trying out.Everyone was friendly here, which is always a plus.  It seemed clean too.  I do wish they had a few more options for toppings (like how about pork and/or BBQ sauce?!?  Make a southern potato!).  They do have salads as well, but let's be honest, I came here for the hot spud..Since I will be staying in town for the rest of the month, I may have to come back and check out other options...
Great food, good variety. I suggest you decline sour cream on your "spud."  The rest of the toppings are flavorful and there is already sauce. The sour cream they offered (and I accepted) only diluted the great taste. They have perfected the baked potato.
So we decided to go with spuds over sandwiches. Yummy!!!! The Wharf was delicious and the crab was fresh. They welcomed substitutions. The salad was fresh and lite. They have one of the best restaurant brownies I've ever had. It was a bit pricey, but for fresh great tasting food with unique flavored, it was the right choice for us.
What an excellent concept. This makes for fora great quick lunch or snack before going in the big bus tours or just grabbing something to est. It's tasty and satisfying and you do not have to feel gross afterward. I had the veggie spud but I wish I had gotten the shrimp spud because my husband's was delicious! These potatoes are huge too so hope you brought somewhat of an appetite. I can see this place coming up with great new spud ideas like maybe shrimp jambalaya or something fun.The staff was very friendly and helpful, my only complaints were that it was kind of warm in this place and there is no ice for beverages. But otherwise a great place to grab a bite :-)
Really good food, both tasty and high quality. Service is friendly & efficient. I came here as part of a Girl Scout trip - the staff was courteous to  and patient with all 6 of our 5th grade girls. All 8 of our orders came out quickly and as ordered. I wish I lived closer so I could come back!
We walked past this restaurant and stopped in here for lunch. It was a great find. They have found so many different ways to prepare a potato. You can also customize it to your liking. The service is excellent and the food was very tasty. My daughter described it best - "it's like subway, but for potato's"
The best baked potato or"jacket" potato I've ever had. It was the bomb.com. I had the custom xtra cheesy bacon shrimp broccoli with butter, sour cream and green onion potato. Off the charts! I could stuff my face with a hundred of these delicious tators. A must if you're at Fisherman's wharf. I definitely had a foodgasm.
Super tasty jacket potatoes! My new favorite spot in this neighborhood. If this place was in the financial district, there would lines around the block at lunch time. I had the veggie, which was excellent. Quick and great for take out.
My Partner and I were on a mission to find a really good snack to hit the spot while on the pier. Found this place and it did just that! Staff were friendly and a bit flirtatious  they weren't in a rush to charge us and made us feel very welcome. Chill atmosphere and good music, couldn't take more than two bites without singing along. The food was bomb! Cajun Shrimp Spud and the Warf Spud were on point. The shrimps were a bit spicy just like I like it! Underneath the shrimp was a good sized spud topped with green onion, corn, black olives on the side and cheese. Decided to pass on the sour cream but finger licking good nonetheless. The Warf Spud was very tasty to my liking. I could do without the mound of purple onion but the green onion, sour cream, crab meat, and corn were satisfying. Will defiantly hit up this spot.
I've been passing this place for a long time but the people I hang out with never wanted to eat here. I'm finally here with someone who will eat here with me!Seriously the most expensive baked potato I've ever eaten but it was really good! It's exactly what I expected and imagined it would be.I would come again for the food, but not too frequently for the price.
I had the pleasure of stopping by to get a meal here recommend by a good friend of mine. I truly did enjoy the shrimp one. It was delicious and I would definitely visit here again when I'm in the are. Staff is friendly too
My potato was created to amazing goodness. I tried the veggie one with all the free toppings. Sooo good. Definitely a must try and the price is really good for the area (fisherman's wharf). If you order online they had some kind of promo as well for $10 off your order of $15+ for your first online order.
Super delis! Light n perfection=D Great for this San Francisco weather. Price is right and walking distance from our hotel n pier
Not quite fast food but not quite a restaurant. Made fresh to order, I made my own with 5 or 6Ingredients and it came out great. Unique / Nice choice in an area with a lot of the same choices. Worth a look!

I was walking towards the "Wharf" and I stumbled upon this place.  It looked unique.  I hadn't had a decent potato in a while, so I figured what the hell, why not.  This place was also not crowded at all...It is a small place, with about 5 tables, a 5 person bar, and a community table (UYE, anyone?!?!).  They have a vast bottled drink collection ranging from Coke products to craft sodas to beers.They have different premade spuds that have a chicken, steak, shrimp, veggie, or crab base.  They also have a create your own option.  That is what I did.I told the lady I wanted steak, wing sauce, sour cream, croutons, and extra cheese.  A few minutes later, it was my time to pick it up.  I do not think the picture does it justice.  Thankfully, I ate all of mine.  It was unique to say the least.  The inside was creamy while the skin was crispy.  Thankfully the provided knife cut right through and did not cut through the "plate".  I ended up eating it all.  With the Coke I got, it was just over $13.  They also have desserts as well I was told they are worth trying out.Everyone was friendly here, which is always a plus.  It seemed clean too.  I do wish they had a few more options for toppings (like how about pork and/or BBQ sauce?!?  Make a southern potato!).  They do have salads as well, but let's be honest, I came here for the hot spud..Since I will be staying in town for the rest of the month, I may have to come back and check out other options...
Great food, good variety. I suggest you decline sour cream on your "spud."  The rest of the toppings are flavorful and there is already sauce. The sour cream they offered (and I accepted) only diluted the great taste. They have perfected the baked potato.
So we decided to go with spuds over sandwiches. Yummy!!!! The Wharf was delicious and the crab was fresh. They welcomed substitutions. The salad was fresh and lite. They have one of the best restaurant brownies I've ever had. It was a bit pricey, but for fresh great tasting food with unique flavored, it was the right choice for us.
What an excellent concept. This makes for fora great quick lunch or snack before going in the big bus tours or just grabbing something to est. It's tasty and satisfying and you do not have to feel gross afterward. I had the veggie spud but I wish I had gotten the shrimp spud because my husband's was delicious! These potatoes are huge too so hope you brought somewhat of an appetite. I can see this place coming up with great new spud ideas like maybe shrimp jambalaya or something fun.The staff was very friendly and helpful, my only complaints were that it was kind of warm in this place and there is no ice for beverages. But otherwise a great place to grab a bite :-)
Really good food, both tasty and high quality. Service is friendly & efficient. I came here as part of a Girl Scout trip - the staff was courteous to  and patient with all 6 of our 5th grade girls. All 8 of our orders came out quickly and as ordered. I wish I lived closer so I could come back!
We walked past this restaurant and stopped in here for lunch. It was a great find. They have found so many different ways to prepare a potato. You can also customize it to your liking. The service is excellent and the food was very tasty. My daughter described it best - "it's like subway, but for potato's"
The best baked potato or"jacket" potato I've ever had. It was the bomb.com. I had the custom xtra cheesy bacon shrimp broccoli with butter, sour cream and green onion potato. Off the charts! I could stuff my face with a hundred of these delicious tators. A must if you're at Fisherman's wharf. I definitely had a foodgasm.
Super tasty jacket potatoes! My new favorite spot in this neighborhood. If this place was in the financial district, there would lines around the block at lunch time. I had the veggie, which was excellent. Quick and great for take out.
My Partner and I were on a mission to find a really good snack to hit the spot while on the pier. Found this place and it did just that! Staff were friendly and a bit flirtatious  they weren't in a rush to charge us and made us feel very welcome. Chill atmosphere and good music, couldn't take more than two bites without singing along. The food was bomb! Cajun Shrimp Spud and the Warf Spud were on point. The shrimps were a bit spicy just like I like it! Underneath the shrimp was a good sized spud topped with green onion, corn, black olives on the side and cheese. Decided to pass on the sour cream but finger licking good nonetheless. The Warf Spud was very tasty to my liking. I could do without the mound of purple onion but the green onion, sour cream, crab meat, and corn were satisfying. Will defiantly hit up this spot.
I've been passing this place for a long time but the people I hang out with never wanted to eat here. I'm finally here with someone who will eat here with me!Seriously the most expensive baked potato I've ever eaten but it was really good! It's exactly what I expected and imagined it would be.I would come again for the food, but not too frequently for the price.
I had the pleasure of stopping by to get a meal here recommend by a good friend of mine. I truly did enjoy the shrimp one. It was delicious and I would definitely visit here again when I'm in the are. Staff is friendly too
My potato was created to amazing goodness. I tried the veggie one with all the free toppings. Sooo good. Definitely a must try and the price is really good for the area (fisherman's wharf). If you order online they had some kind of promo as well for $10 off your order of $15+ for your first online order.
Super delis! Light n perfection=D Great for this San Francisco weather. Price is right and walking distance from our hotel n pier
Not quite fast food but not quite a restaurant. Made fresh to order, I made my own with 5 or 6Ingredients and it came out great. Unique / Nice choice in an area with a lot of the same choices. Worth a look!
