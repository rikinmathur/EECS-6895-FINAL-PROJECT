I'm First to Review Museum of Vision.  It's a FREE small museum that you need to make reservations to see.  You'll want to talk to Jenny E. Benjamin, MA Director.  Only open M-F 9am-5pm.  Closed Weekends & Holidays.I had an appointment for Fri 11/19/10 and meet up with Jenny.  Location: Hyde & Beach in the same building as Chloe Fine Arts Gallery & Tiernan's Irish Pub across the street from The Cannery.  You need to check in with the Receptionist & get a badge.Jenny came & showed me the permanent collection of info on Eye problems like: Macular Degeneration; Glaucoma; Cataract.  I got some brochures & took pics.Then we went to the 3rd Fl and saw the Current Exhibit: "Eyes Examined" Many items in glass cases about tools & different ways they treated eye problems.  It was very interesting. Jenny also took me to the 4th Fl to see what once was someone's home, now a bunch of offices.  He liked Egyptians stuff so there's something that looks like a Pyramid, good views outside of the Golden Gate Bridge & Alcatraz in one office we went too.New exhibit should be in January 2011.  I think it's once a year.Worth checking out.Website:museumofvision.org
