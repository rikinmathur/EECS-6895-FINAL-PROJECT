A nice, small playground up the street from the WP library.I like that it's enclosed and clean! There's a huge grassy area that's perfect for running around, kicking the ball around or picking daisies. (Bummer our dog can't join us here!)Parking can get challenging, but it is West Portal, you'll find a spot walking distance from the park, at the very least.
Looks clean and secure, but not sure about the kids who use this park.  It was filled with school-aged kids on their lunch break when my toddler and I arrived. My daughter was overwhelmed with the amount of kids on the play structures. A couple of kids were being annoying one of which kicked my daughter's buggy (it was not in the way) and another attempted to knock down my hot tea that was resting on a ledge. It wasn't a great experience and I don't think I'd put the effort to walk up the hill to get here again.
3.5 starsThe good: enclosed by a gate for safety, residential hilly street lacking speeding cars, well-kept jungle gym, sand for falls from monkey bars, clean (no dog poop all over), and within walking distance to restaurants and a toy shop.The bad: on the very small side and is sometimes crowded, horrible street parking only. The ugly: I hate to say it, but the older kids who come here without parents are bratty and obnoxious. I've observed this over months now, and when school is out (as I'm updating this review), the level of obnoxiousness seems much higher. Teens also wait on the grassy areas to take over the playground after 6pm when parents and tots leave for the evening. I've been here until 7pm with my family.
This playground will have at least one MILF when you go.  I don't mind; I like to look at pretty ladies.Knock off one star for no parking lot; street parking only.**Disclaimer/useless fact**I am straight.
