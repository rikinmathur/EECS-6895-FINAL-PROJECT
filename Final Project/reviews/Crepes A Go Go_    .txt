Ok, so we are heading to our 'fancy' meal and I do the right thing by our Uber driver and just tell him to pull over on the side of the street he's driving on to save him the hassle of spinning the car around, just so happens, it's Karma....as we are dropped outside this little joint, I'm starving..and make a mental bookmark of it.I skip dessert at said fancy eaterie to head back here after....these crepes are outstanding...not dry, substantial, full of flavour, and they don't skip on the fillings either.....I was genuinely sitting on their sofa's in their yard area wishing I'd just come here and saved myself $200...I'd have had an unhappy wife....but the crepes were (almost) good enough for marital disharmony...superb.
Great late night spot! Delicioius crepes, with fresh flavors. I really enjoyed my veggie crepe. There was a bunch of hot sauces to the side and we taste tested all of them. I can't remember which one was the best... but don't go for the La Victoria... that one was weird.Anyway, happy crepe-ing!
Got the banana and Nutella with whipped cream. Delicious, of course. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they only take cash, no credit or debit. It is open late, which is a plus!
Ended up here after going to Bergerac a few establishments down the street. I was pleasantly surprised to see its high ratings on Yelp. We ordered a Nutella and fresh strawberry crepe, and then asked to add bananas as well. Pricing was a bit higher than I would've expected, but I guess that's the price for fresh fruit!Order took less than 10 minutes to come out. It was huge (pretty much as big as Crepevine crepes, stuffed with bunch of fruit and globs of Nutella, and was nice and hot when it came out. It definitely made my night, especially after a poor experience at Bergerac!
Perfect for the late night after party craving....quick and simple plus your options of sweet or savory. Only downside is that its outdoor-foodtruck-seating that can be freezing late nights. other than that, no complaints
I used to love this place but the last two times I've went it's just not the same. Not sure if it's the quality or that I wasn't drunk the last few times but I'm sad they're no longer up to par.
I came here drunk and also after having a dirty dog (that I didn't remember having). Ordered a beef and onion? based crepe, forgot the name for obvious reasons, and the monstrosity came out to close to $10. I only had $9 but the guys working there were really nice and let me have it for $9. 10/10 drunk times would definitely come back.
Amazing crepes that really hit the spot after a night out at DNA lounge! There can be some lines but they move pretty quickly. I got the cheese, smoked turkey, and egg crepe, which was seasoned really well and pretty large for $7 - I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. They have a bunch of savory crepe options and even more sweet ones, depending on what kind of mood you're in. Perfect place to grab a bite to eat and hang out with friends if you're not quite ready for the night to end yet :P
Come to this food truck, post or pre or mid - drinking to eat huge handheld crepes, swaddled like a baby, filled with cheese and smoked turkey and avocado and onions and/or chocolate and strawberries and bananas and whipped cream and all sorts of awesome, crepe-y deliciousness. What else do you need to know??
I visit Crepes A Go Go exactly once a year: When I'm in town for a work conference and then get absolutely blitzed on jello shots at the neighboring Butter. Crepes make much better drunk food than Spaghetti-Os, so I trek out to this food cart and thoroughly enjoy their offerings. These fine folks serve up a decent variety of savory crepes, which I believe are better at soaking up the booze. Sure, there are sweet varieties, but that's not for me. I like meat. Specifically, I like whatever has the smoked turkey and pineapple, it's legit. But then again, I've never had these sober...They're affordable but cash only, so bring those dollars!
Hidden gem in the rough. They offer sweet and savory crepes.My Verdict: Recommend.
I don't have too many fond things to say about my ex from Trinidad, as most of my quality memories were eclipsed the moment I found out he was cheating on me with a woman in her mid-50's from Minnesota. (I'm just going to have to pray it was a sugamama sort of arrangement and know it has no bearing on my value in life.) But one thing that at least somewhat eases my consternation is the fact that he introduced me to the Crepes A Go Go truck. Disgustingly drunk, a sloppy mess, at an unholy and ghastly hour in what can only be described as a semi-somnambulant stupor, I have made my way to this truck by hook or by crook and never been disappointed. (I only wish I could say the same of our love affair.) I always went for the avocado, sun-dried tomato and Jack cheese and would practically cry tears of joy every time my order was called and I (or some other, more sober member of our party) would reach up to retrieve the lil' foiled and folded bundle of joy. That is so much better than any newborn I will ever reach for after hours of grueling and intensive labor. Plus in this situation, I get to eat--whereas in childbirth, only the babe does.I'm sure they don't appreciate it whenever I encourage my designated driver to double park, flip on those hazards and essentially bump NWA so that I can jump out and get my order started as quickly as possible, but I think almost anyone can be bought with a hefty tip and what I hope was a really dapper wink but probably looked like a mild seizure to the person I was giving it to. No matter, at least I got what I came for. I prefer the savory crepes here because I'm just a savory type of gyal but the sweet crepes are divine too! I just happen to be the type of lady that stays loyal and true once she finds something she likes--unlike my ex. But thanks for the restaurant recommendation!
Who doesn't love a late night crepe? Savory or sweet, Dessert or Snack? You can do it all!It's a food truck in a little alley right next to Butter and across the street from DNA Lounge. Very convenient for those who are drunk/buzzed after a fun night.I actually came for dessert since I had dinner nearby. I got the King Lias crepe and I added strawberries. The crepe itself is $7, reasonable, but adding strawberries was an additional $2.50. I honestly had no idea extra strawberries were so expensive or else I wouldn't have gotten it. I couldn't find a price for additional toppings on their menu. The king lias crepe was delicious with an awesome medley of flavors and textures. The only thing I didn't like is that they make their crepes on the softer side, it had no crunch to it. And the fact that my delicious crepe was $10. It was delicious but not $10's worth in my opinion. I also like to have ice cream in my crepes which they don't offer.Cash Only.This wouldn't be my first choice for crepes, but if I was nearby I would not mind stopping by to get a crepe.
Oh the life of a cat. the poor soul who finds himself outside of a nearby club, and experiencing some late night hunger. thankfully, some friends had the same idea, and led me to the perfect spot for something that would be exactly what I was looking for!My friends took me to this little cart after a night at the nearby "STUD" Bar. I have had crepes before, many many crepes in fact from all sorts of crepe places around SF and the bay area, so I was interested to see how this place would fare among some of the others. I noticed a menu that had some great savory options so I decided to go for the cheese, avocado and tomato. the crepes here are made fast and speedy, and the service is very nice and friendly. this place definitely seems to be hot among the late night clubbers as people from Butter and DNA lounge all flooded over to the little carts hideaway. I really enjoyed the crepe here! the ingredients were nice and fresh, and the crepe was served just warm enough to how I like. nothing too fancy in terms of serving, just wrapped in a foil cone, but that's really all you need. definitely a great and inexpensive food option for the late night people of the area, and I'll definitely be making my way back here in the future! *chirp!*
If your in the city or near the city, this is a must go to spot! They have variety of options on the menu. If you want something sweet they have an endless option. If your craving something more filling and dinner or breakfast like they have it on the menu as well. The price is decent for a bit pricey but its totally worst going. It is a food truck and outside but they do have a seating area near the truck. After the bar or late night cravings this is the spot!!
I can't believe I've lived in San Francisco for 3 years and have not discovered this perfect joint for after-the-bar-closes hunger that is open til 4am on Fridays and Saturdays and next to DNA Lounge and Audio. It is almost hidden but there is a nice sitting area. The sweet crepes I've had exactly the same elsewhere, but what I really recommend is the one with the jalapenos- it's was amazing. I think it was the #4 special. Their savory crepes are really my happy place after midnight.
Thank you Crepes a Go Go for making me fit to drive last Saturday. Le BF and I had one too many over at Butter. After checking out the line for Bootie and not wanting to pay $20 for cover (gettin too old and too much in a relationship for ish like that), we stumbled around the street and realized we weren't really in a state to drive yet. Crepes and their picnic tables to the rescue! I can never resist Nutella, so I went for the banana, nutella, and peanut butter crepe. Was seriously amazing. Crepe was light and fluffy, really set off the flavors well. For me it would be hard to mess up a peanut butter/nutella combination, but I think the texture of the crepe really added to it. Le BF got a savory crepe, but I was honestly too engrossed in my Nutella crepe to pay too much attention. Pretty sure he enjoyed his too. Was delicious and I will definitely be back! :)
Their crepes are so delicious! Service was fast and friendly. We got a sweet crepe and a savory one and both were delicious. Good portion size as well. Locate conveniently next to some bars
This truck is (permanently?) parked in a somewhat shady part of SOMA that happens to be filled with a number of late night haunts for those who enjoy dancing and/or imbibing in liquid poetry (or firewater, depending on which place you frequent). I don't know about the rest of you, but my friends and I usually find ourselves seeking quick and convenient calorie-heavy food at some point during/after.Enter the Crepes-a-Go-Go truck. It's open until 3AM (or at least was when I used to frequent it) and offers you a convenient handheld solution. Who needs the hassle of a fork when the world is spinning around them? Not I! Once you've tried and loved it, it's hard to stray from the classic Nutella-banana sweet crepe base. To mix it up a little, sometimes we add cinnamon and strawberries or coconut. Everything has turned out delicious, and while the credit may largely be due to the Nutella, Crepes-a-Go-Go makes a darn good crepe base and matches your Nutella with just the right amount of complementary toppings. They don't match up to the gourmet crepes I've tried in other cities near and far but they're certainly a great & easy choice for under $10!We have yet to try the savory crepes at this location, but many in my company have tried it and devoured it with the passion of a starved wildebeest. Looked good to me!
I was craving a crepe and found this place was open late. it was my first time here and i was shocked by the small food truck but OMG!!!! Was the reaction I had after tasting one of the crepes here. I got a banana, almond and nutella crepe and it was BOMB!The service was good too. The crepes were delicious I would totally come here again.

Their crepes are so delicious! Service was fast and friendly. We got a sweet crepe and a savory one and both were delicious. Good portion size as well. Locate conveniently next to some bars
This truck is (permanently?) parked in a somewhat shady part of SOMA that happens to be filled with a number of late night haunts for those who enjoy dancing and/or imbibing in liquid poetry (or firewater, depending on which place you frequent). I don't know about the rest of you, but my friends and I usually find ourselves seeking quick and convenient calorie-heavy food at some point during/after.Enter the Crepes-a-Go-Go truck. It's open until 3AM (or at least was when I used to frequent it) and offers you a convenient handheld solution. Who needs the hassle of a fork when the world is spinning around them? Not I! Once you've tried and loved it, it's hard to stray from the classic Nutella-banana sweet crepe base. To mix it up a little, sometimes we add cinnamon and strawberries or coconut. Everything has turned out delicious, and while the credit may largely be due to the Nutella, Crepes-a-Go-Go makes a darn good crepe base and matches your Nutella with just the right amount of complementary toppings. They don't match up to the gourmet crepes I've tried in other cities near and far but they're certainly a great & easy choice for under $10!We have yet to try the savory crepes at this location, but many in my company have tried it and devoured it with the passion of a starved wildebeest. Looked good to me!
I was craving a crepe and found this place was open late. it was my first time here and i was shocked by the small food truck but OMG!!!! Was the reaction I had after tasting one of the crepes here. I got a banana, almond and nutella crepe and it was BOMB!The service was good too. The crepes were delicious I would totally come here again.
Ok, so we are heading to our 'fancy' meal and I do the right thing by our Uber driver and just tell him to pull over on the side of the street he's driving on to save him the hassle of spinning the car around, just so happens, it's Karma....as we are dropped outside this little joint, I'm starving..and make a mental bookmark of it.I skip dessert at said fancy eaterie to head back here after....these crepes are outstanding...not dry, substantial, full of flavour, and they don't skip on the fillings either.....I was genuinely sitting on their sofa's in their yard area wishing I'd just come here and saved myself $200...I'd have had an unhappy wife....but the crepes were (almost) good enough for marital disharmony...superb.
Great late night spot! Delicioius crepes, with fresh flavors. I really enjoyed my veggie crepe. There was a bunch of hot sauces to the side and we taste tested all of them. I can't remember which one was the best... but don't go for the La Victoria... that one was weird.Anyway, happy crepe-ing!
Got the banana and Nutella with whipped cream. Delicious, of course. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they only take cash, no credit or debit. It is open late, which is a plus!
Ended up here after going to Bergerac a few establishments down the street. I was pleasantly surprised to see its high ratings on Yelp. We ordered a Nutella and fresh strawberry crepe, and then asked to add bananas as well. Pricing was a bit higher than I would've expected, but I guess that's the price for fresh fruit!Order took less than 10 minutes to come out. It was huge (pretty much as big as Crepevine crepes, stuffed with bunch of fruit and globs of Nutella, and was nice and hot when it came out. It definitely made my night, especially after a poor experience at Bergerac!
Perfect for the late night after party craving....quick and simple plus your options of sweet or savory. Only downside is that its outdoor-foodtruck-seating that can be freezing late nights. other than that, no complaints
I used to love this place but the last two times I've went it's just not the same. Not sure if it's the quality or that I wasn't drunk the last few times but I'm sad they're no longer up to par.
I came here drunk and also after having a dirty dog (that I didn't remember having). Ordered a beef and onion? based crepe, forgot the name for obvious reasons, and the monstrosity came out to close to $10. I only had $9 but the guys working there were really nice and let me have it for $9. 10/10 drunk times would definitely come back.
Amazing crepes that really hit the spot after a night out at DNA lounge! There can be some lines but they move pretty quickly. I got the cheese, smoked turkey, and egg crepe, which was seasoned really well and pretty large for $7 - I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. They have a bunch of savory crepe options and even more sweet ones, depending on what kind of mood you're in. Perfect place to grab a bite to eat and hang out with friends if you're not quite ready for the night to end yet :P
Come to this food truck, post or pre or mid - drinking to eat huge handheld crepes, swaddled like a baby, filled with cheese and smoked turkey and avocado and onions and/or chocolate and strawberries and bananas and whipped cream and all sorts of awesome, crepe-y deliciousness. What else do you need to know??
I visit Crepes A Go Go exactly once a year: When I'm in town for a work conference and then get absolutely blitzed on jello shots at the neighboring Butter. Crepes make much better drunk food than Spaghetti-Os, so I trek out to this food cart and thoroughly enjoy their offerings. These fine folks serve up a decent variety of savory crepes, which I believe are better at soaking up the booze. Sure, there are sweet varieties, but that's not for me. I like meat. Specifically, I like whatever has the smoked turkey and pineapple, it's legit. But then again, I've never had these sober...They're affordable but cash only, so bring those dollars!
Hidden gem in the rough. They offer sweet and savory crepes.My Verdict: Recommend.
I don't have too many fond things to say about my ex from Trinidad, as most of my quality memories were eclipsed the moment I found out he was cheating on me with a woman in her mid-50's from Minnesota. (I'm just going to have to pray it was a sugamama sort of arrangement and know it has no bearing on my value in life.) But one thing that at least somewhat eases my consternation is the fact that he introduced me to the Crepes A Go Go truck. Disgustingly drunk, a sloppy mess, at an unholy and ghastly hour in what can only be described as a semi-somnambulant stupor, I have made my way to this truck by hook or by crook and never been disappointed. (I only wish I could say the same of our love affair.) I always went for the avocado, sun-dried tomato and Jack cheese and would practically cry tears of joy every time my order was called and I (or some other, more sober member of our party) would reach up to retrieve the lil' foiled and folded bundle of joy. That is so much better than any newborn I will ever reach for after hours of grueling and intensive labor. Plus in this situation, I get to eat--whereas in childbirth, only the babe does.I'm sure they don't appreciate it whenever I encourage my designated driver to double park, flip on those hazards and essentially bump NWA so that I can jump out and get my order started as quickly as possible, but I think almost anyone can be bought with a hefty tip and what I hope was a really dapper wink but probably looked like a mild seizure to the person I was giving it to. No matter, at least I got what I came for. I prefer the savory crepes here because I'm just a savory type of gyal but the sweet crepes are divine too! I just happen to be the type of lady that stays loyal and true once she finds something she likes--unlike my ex. But thanks for the restaurant recommendation!
Who doesn't love a late night crepe? Savory or sweet, Dessert or Snack? You can do it all!It's a food truck in a little alley right next to Butter and across the street from DNA Lounge. Very convenient for those who are drunk/buzzed after a fun night.I actually came for dessert since I had dinner nearby. I got the King Lias crepe and I added strawberries. The crepe itself is $7, reasonable, but adding strawberries was an additional $2.50. I honestly had no idea extra strawberries were so expensive or else I wouldn't have gotten it. I couldn't find a price for additional toppings on their menu. The king lias crepe was delicious with an awesome medley of flavors and textures. The only thing I didn't like is that they make their crepes on the softer side, it had no crunch to it. And the fact that my delicious crepe was $10. It was delicious but not $10's worth in my opinion. I also like to have ice cream in my crepes which they don't offer.Cash Only.This wouldn't be my first choice for crepes, but if I was nearby I would not mind stopping by to get a crepe.
Oh the life of a cat. the poor soul who finds himself outside of a nearby club, and experiencing some late night hunger. thankfully, some friends had the same idea, and led me to the perfect spot for something that would be exactly what I was looking for!My friends took me to this little cart after a night at the nearby "STUD" Bar. I have had crepes before, many many crepes in fact from all sorts of crepe places around SF and the bay area, so I was interested to see how this place would fare among some of the others. I noticed a menu that had some great savory options so I decided to go for the cheese, avocado and tomato. the crepes here are made fast and speedy, and the service is very nice and friendly. this place definitely seems to be hot among the late night clubbers as people from Butter and DNA lounge all flooded over to the little carts hideaway. I really enjoyed the crepe here! the ingredients were nice and fresh, and the crepe was served just warm enough to how I like. nothing too fancy in terms of serving, just wrapped in a foil cone, but that's really all you need. definitely a great and inexpensive food option for the late night people of the area, and I'll definitely be making my way back here in the future! *chirp!*
If your in the city or near the city, this is a must go to spot! They have variety of options on the menu. If you want something sweet they have an endless option. If your craving something more filling and dinner or breakfast like they have it on the menu as well. The price is decent for a bit pricey but its totally worst going. It is a food truck and outside but they do have a seating area near the truck. After the bar or late night cravings this is the spot!!
I can't believe I've lived in San Francisco for 3 years and have not discovered this perfect joint for after-the-bar-closes hunger that is open til 4am on Fridays and Saturdays and next to DNA Lounge and Audio. It is almost hidden but there is a nice sitting area. The sweet crepes I've had exactly the same elsewhere, but what I really recommend is the one with the jalapenos- it's was amazing. I think it was the #4 special. Their savory crepes are really my happy place after midnight.
Thank you Crepes a Go Go for making me fit to drive last Saturday. Le BF and I had one too many over at Butter. After checking out the line for Bootie and not wanting to pay $20 for cover (gettin too old and too much in a relationship for ish like that), we stumbled around the street and realized we weren't really in a state to drive yet. Crepes and their picnic tables to the rescue! I can never resist Nutella, so I went for the banana, nutella, and peanut butter crepe. Was seriously amazing. Crepe was light and fluffy, really set off the flavors well. For me it would be hard to mess up a peanut butter/nutella combination, but I think the texture of the crepe really added to it. Le BF got a savory crepe, but I was honestly too engrossed in my Nutella crepe to pay too much attention. Pretty sure he enjoyed his too. Was delicious and I will definitely be back! :)
