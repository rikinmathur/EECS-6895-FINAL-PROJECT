Oh my! While staying in San Francisco, my friends and I hiked over a mile to this place.  Let me tell you, it was worth the thigh burn.  I ordered nachos with black beans, no meat.  Avocado came with it, too! Woo! There were a lot of chips on that plate, and I ate every last one of them.  And it's not like those nachos you get where all the goods are only at the top and you need salsa to finish the rest of the chips. Oh no!  They are evenly distributed. My favorite is when you get to the bottom and the chips are a little soggy, covered in goodness.  Yes! I love it! I did the good food chair dance.Yes I did. The atmosphere is just right, too.  They had some good music playing. A little mix of everything: pop, oldies, salsa, salsa tropical, reggaeton, it was great! And you can't beat the price.  My meal was under $10.This place is booming!  People everywhere.  You should go with 2 people, that way one of you can grab a table before they're all gone. You're guaranteed to do a little salsa in your seat while eating!
Overall nice place, though I was expecting a much better tasting food!The type of place: You order first then they call your order number when the food is ready. You anywhere you want, anywhere that is available. What I liked:- Strawberry drink!!- Very nice and friendly personal!- The place food is relatively cheap for what you getWhat needs improvement - The food: For a place that is rated 4 stars and a half I was surprised to see that the place was relatively empty! And this was at 12:15 pm - lunch time! Well after I tasted the food I understood why: if you do not choose the super spicy option, the food has so little taste! The ingredients were healthy (avocado, tomatoes, beans, etc.) though no taste!
3.5 HuevosUnfortunately the Al Pastor rotisserie was not working....sad face.Carnitas had good flavor but the texture wass a fail. Soggy and Limp ( Insert Cherylynn N double entendre here). In my lilly white opinion carnitas should be fried and have a crunchy texture....Gordo's does this really well.The Chicken actually was pretty good.I had a burrito and I thought it was just okay. My Wife's tacos were a much more appealing dish.What I really noticed ( of course after the fact) were the Nachos.....everyone was getting them and they looked good and were a good bargain.Chips are not homemade and generic.Salsas are great but the Salsa bar  was never refilled...and pretty much empty.Place is not the most clean.Parking is a pure nightmare.
SO HAPPY THIS PLACE IS NEAR ME! So important to have a dank burrito/taco place close to home. Not much is needed to be said when you've eaten a great burrito.
Had a 930pm CRAVING for nachos so I made my way over here.  I'm almost sure they add msg.I ordered nachos with marinated pork and horchata. My dish was overly salty and had a killer headache afterwards.  So sad, because this was my favourite place for nachos.
Came here for lunch before going on bike riding.They have a board menu by the entrance that you can check out before you go inside the restaurant. Of course they have the boars menu by the cashier as well since thats where you will order your food at before you dine in or take it to go.Ready to order...they won't cook your food until you place your order by the cashierThey made your food quick...but i did came right on time before the the restaurant got full/busy.Super burrito with steak for $8.95. Seems like they give okay amount of meat. and also tacos which comes in 2 for $7. Got chicken for both tacos. Since its in tortilla, they fill the chickens to the edge. But I thought the prices for both items are pricy. The foods are pretty average and had decent amount of flavor.
What a pleasant surprise! The portions were generous and the meat was perfectly cooked. They have a variety of options, meats and salsas. I prefer the meat tacos over the fish tacos.Finding a table was a bit tricky, but luckily my friend eyed one out and snatched it quick. It's a real informal place with self-serve sauces and water.
Had to come back to Street Taco when I was in the area because they always come through. On a scale of hunger from 1-10, a solid 8. I ordered a carne asada super burrito and, well, I must say it did not disappoint. I'm three-quarters of the way through that monstrosity and I am extremely satisfied. My friend enjoyed two plates of street tacos and that was a challenge for him - they have great, generous plate sizes of delectable foods. Highly recommend.
Being from SoCal, my expectations were not terribly high going to a Mexican restaurant; frankly, I had no idea what to expect. Plus, most of the places in this district (Haight-Ashbury) seemed pretty less than exciting. However, this place could not have further surpassed my expectations. Their food was fresh, flavorful, and exceptional. In fact, I don't believe that SoCal fast-food type Mexican places match this quality. I'll definitely return. Their guacamole was excellent, their chicken well spiced, and the strawberry drink was killer. I will be back.
On a rainy day there's nothing like a burrito, I ordered it through door dash, the burrito got delivered in a timely manner and was still relatively warm.I ordered the super burrito with campechano, black beans and everything else it came with.  Let me start be saying that the black beans were nowhere to be found, this burrito was mostly rice and campechano, smh not so super for a super burrito.  Overall the flavor were good, however if we're doing the farolito comparison farolito definitely comes out on top.If I'm in the haight and I desperately want a burrito I'll probably stop by, however if I can I'd make the strech to the mission and go to la tequeria, el farolito or even taqueria cancun to fully satisfy my craving, however if those options are not feasible this place will do.
Call it arrogance, but having now spent three years as a resident of Dallas I've caught myself almost unknowingly fielding the opinion that there aren't any better tacos outside of the Texas state borders. Enter Street Taco, who slapped me right back down to earth some of the best authentic tacos I've had. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I walked through the doors of Street Taco. While the interior was nothing unlike what I commonly encounter back in Dallas, it all felt a bit strange strolling into an authentic Mexican taqueria in the midst of most groovy neighborhood in San Francisco. My hesitation was quickly washed away upon seeing the giant spinning spit full of pork and the other various meats being freshly prepared behind the counter. The process was simple: place your order at the counter, have a brief sit, and wait for your glorious meal to be procured at the counter. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?"$3.50 for a single taco? That seems a bit muc... Oh... oh my"This was pretty much my exact thought process as I watched the patrons in front of me get their order. Make no mistake - these tacos are absolutely massive. See that picture at the bottom of this review? Two tacos, although there may as well be four there. Considering the portion size and the menu breadth Street Tacos prices are nothing short of extraordinary given that this is San Francisco we're talking about, and value like that should be shouted from the mountain tops. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Oh yeah. I hinted as much in the beginning of this review, but these were some of the better authentic tacos I've had. Period. I opted for a steak taco and an al pastor taco, and my only regret was that I wasn't able to sample even more of the wonderful meats available at Street Taco. These were some of the freshest ingredients in the game, and they were served in generous quantities bundles together in freshly made tortillas. I'm usually not one for large quantities of salsa or cilantro, but both made the meats work all the more, and the aggregate flavor was excellent if I haven't already made that clear. Marvelous. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Without question or hesitation. Star Granted.
Came to use the bathroom! We were walking along Haight Ashbury, we had to go super bad and this was the only place we thought had a public restroom available. Not sure if you have to order food in order to use the bathroom, but we didn't care, nature calls! You order at the counter. I ordered a two street taco plate. I thought it was pricey for just two tacos, but I figured it must have a side of rice and beans. Nope, it was just two tacos. It's $7 for two but I ordered one with shrimp, which was a $1 extra. When our order came out, I wasn't impressed, the taco with shrimp had barely any shrimp, but a lot of shredded lettuce. The taco with carne Asada, was decent but I've had better back home, at a fraction of a cost. My disappointment is with their bathroom. It's only one stall. We had to pee super bad and the lighting sucks ass! My biggest gripe is that the toilet seat is off its hinges. Along with dim light, try wiping your ass on a wobbly seat. I almost fell off the seat, kinda gross when the boys get pee everywhere but in the commode! No Bueno! Put a repair order in, por favor, ASAP! You don't want someone busting their ass, trying to wipe it!
Love the pastor meat here. Love this place. If u go to height st and like Mexican food.  U will love this place.
From the smell when you walk in the door to the vibrant, clean, and energetic atmosphere when you make your way through the line, u can just tell this place was going to be a winner.  Came to try the guac, but wound up upgrading to the beef nachos--CORRECTNESSBeef was savory and soft. Perfectly cooked and the fresh crispy corn tortillas and the happy refried beans, are going to make my uber driver pay big on the way back to union square.Don't forget to grab a seat quick because it fills up quickly.THATS STREET!!
I thought these taco's were great!!! A great little joint in the Haight and Ashbury district! A little on the pricey side, but I was filled up by it!
I recently moved to the Haight and this place has quickly become my go-to burrito spot. The food is tasty and less greasy than your average taqueria, which makes it all go down a bit easier. Really friendly staff as well make the experience wonderful. It's quick, tasty, and filling. What more do you want in a grab-n-go burrito joint?
Just a couple very good reasons to come here.1. You're just too far away from the sights and sounds of the neighborhood that is more associated with Hispanic food.2. You need a homemade flour tortilla.If both conditions are met, you'll find a friend in the quesadillas here. Don't opt for the burrito because the tortilla is extra special when grilled. The fillings are decent, with the rib meat being the tastiest. It's also the owner's fav for what it's worth.Go nuts on the salsas. Them's tasty suckers.Really more of a 3.5 but rounding up.
My go to place for Mexican food. Delicious and large portions. They have lots of selections from tacos, to burritos, to fried taco shell bowls. They also have a huuuge selection of meats and a variety of salsas. I have gone with my parents and take my friends to visit if they are looking for a good quick bite.There's usually a place to sit and the people that work there are super friendly.
Super causal, bright, taco spot on Haight. They have a ton of options- huge variety of meats + salsas. The tacos are larger than average; they are very generous on the meat. The nachos are scrumptious,, too! Be careful not to order too much. It's a great bang for your buck.  It is a new restaurant- bright, clean and fresh atmosphere. Great spot to stop and eat as you are exploring Haight street.
4.5 stars. Phenomenal tacos, especially alambres taco (chicken or beef with cheese, and I had the chicken one). The fish taco was so so - I had ones with fresher fish from LA or other places in SF. Part of what makes the tacos fantastic is the salsa - just nothing but balance, fresh herbs, and burst of flavors.  The spicy one definitely have a kick. The jalapeños pepper that one could get on the side is super fresh and flavorful. The chips also looked amazing, very thin and not too greasy - bet that it's pretty amazing with the salsa.

Love the pastor meat here. Love this place. If u go to height st and like Mexican food.  U will love this place.
From the smell when you walk in the door to the vibrant, clean, and energetic atmosphere when you make your way through the line, u can just tell this place was going to be a winner.  Came to try the guac, but wound up upgrading to the beef nachos--CORRECTNESSBeef was savory and soft. Perfectly cooked and the fresh crispy corn tortillas and the happy refried beans, are going to make my uber driver pay big on the way back to union square.Don't forget to grab a seat quick because it fills up quickly.THATS STREET!!
I thought these taco's were great!!! A great little joint in the Haight and Ashbury district! A little on the pricey side, but I was filled up by it!
I recently moved to the Haight and this place has quickly become my go-to burrito spot. The food is tasty and less greasy than your average taqueria, which makes it all go down a bit easier. Really friendly staff as well make the experience wonderful. It's quick, tasty, and filling. What more do you want in a grab-n-go burrito joint?
Just a couple very good reasons to come here.1. You're just too far away from the sights and sounds of the neighborhood that is more associated with Hispanic food.2. You need a homemade flour tortilla.If both conditions are met, you'll find a friend in the quesadillas here. Don't opt for the burrito because the tortilla is extra special when grilled. The fillings are decent, with the rib meat being the tastiest. It's also the owner's fav for what it's worth.Go nuts on the salsas. Them's tasty suckers.Really more of a 3.5 but rounding up.
My go to place for Mexican food. Delicious and large portions. They have lots of selections from tacos, to burritos, to fried taco shell bowls. They also have a huuuge selection of meats and a variety of salsas. I have gone with my parents and take my friends to visit if they are looking for a good quick bite.There's usually a place to sit and the people that work there are super friendly.
Super causal, bright, taco spot on Haight. They have a ton of options- huge variety of meats + salsas. The tacos are larger than average; they are very generous on the meat. The nachos are scrumptious,, too! Be careful not to order too much. It's a great bang for your buck.  It is a new restaurant- bright, clean and fresh atmosphere. Great spot to stop and eat as you are exploring Haight street.
4.5 stars. Phenomenal tacos, especially alambres taco (chicken or beef with cheese, and I had the chicken one). The fish taco was so so - I had ones with fresher fish from LA or other places in SF. Part of what makes the tacos fantastic is the salsa - just nothing but balance, fresh herbs, and burst of flavors.  The spicy one definitely have a kick. The jalapeños pepper that one could get on the side is super fresh and flavorful. The chips also looked amazing, very thin and not too greasy - bet that it's pretty amazing with the salsa.
Oh my! While staying in San Francisco, my friends and I hiked over a mile to this place.  Let me tell you, it was worth the thigh burn.  I ordered nachos with black beans, no meat.  Avocado came with it, too! Woo! There were a lot of chips on that plate, and I ate every last one of them.  And it's not like those nachos you get where all the goods are only at the top and you need salsa to finish the rest of the chips. Oh no!  They are evenly distributed. My favorite is when you get to the bottom and the chips are a little soggy, covered in goodness.  Yes! I love it! I did the good food chair dance.Yes I did. The atmosphere is just right, too.  They had some good music playing. A little mix of everything: pop, oldies, salsa, salsa tropical, reggaeton, it was great! And you can't beat the price.  My meal was under $10.This place is booming!  People everywhere.  You should go with 2 people, that way one of you can grab a table before they're all gone. You're guaranteed to do a little salsa in your seat while eating!
Overall nice place, though I was expecting a much better tasting food!The type of place: You order first then they call your order number when the food is ready. You anywhere you want, anywhere that is available. What I liked:- Strawberry drink!!- Very nice and friendly personal!- The place food is relatively cheap for what you getWhat needs improvement - The food: For a place that is rated 4 stars and a half I was surprised to see that the place was relatively empty! And this was at 12:15 pm - lunch time! Well after I tasted the food I understood why: if you do not choose the super spicy option, the food has so little taste! The ingredients were healthy (avocado, tomatoes, beans, etc.) though no taste!
3.5 HuevosUnfortunately the Al Pastor rotisserie was not working....sad face.Carnitas had good flavor but the texture wass a fail. Soggy and Limp ( Insert Cherylynn N double entendre here). In my lilly white opinion carnitas should be fried and have a crunchy texture....Gordo's does this really well.The Chicken actually was pretty good.I had a burrito and I thought it was just okay. My Wife's tacos were a much more appealing dish.What I really noticed ( of course after the fact) were the Nachos.....everyone was getting them and they looked good and were a good bargain.Chips are not homemade and generic.Salsas are great but the Salsa bar  was never refilled...and pretty much empty.Place is not the most clean.Parking is a pure nightmare.
SO HAPPY THIS PLACE IS NEAR ME! So important to have a dank burrito/taco place close to home. Not much is needed to be said when you've eaten a great burrito.
Had a 930pm CRAVING for nachos so I made my way over here.  I'm almost sure they add msg.I ordered nachos with marinated pork and horchata. My dish was overly salty and had a killer headache afterwards.  So sad, because this was my favourite place for nachos.
Came here for lunch before going on bike riding.They have a board menu by the entrance that you can check out before you go inside the restaurant. Of course they have the boars menu by the cashier as well since thats where you will order your food at before you dine in or take it to go.Ready to order...they won't cook your food until you place your order by the cashierThey made your food quick...but i did came right on time before the the restaurant got full/busy.Super burrito with steak for $8.95. Seems like they give okay amount of meat. and also tacos which comes in 2 for $7. Got chicken for both tacos. Since its in tortilla, they fill the chickens to the edge. But I thought the prices for both items are pricy. The foods are pretty average and had decent amount of flavor.
What a pleasant surprise! The portions were generous and the meat was perfectly cooked. They have a variety of options, meats and salsas. I prefer the meat tacos over the fish tacos.Finding a table was a bit tricky, but luckily my friend eyed one out and snatched it quick. It's a real informal place with self-serve sauces and water.
Had to come back to Street Taco when I was in the area because they always come through. On a scale of hunger from 1-10, a solid 8. I ordered a carne asada super burrito and, well, I must say it did not disappoint. I'm three-quarters of the way through that monstrosity and I am extremely satisfied. My friend enjoyed two plates of street tacos and that was a challenge for him - they have great, generous plate sizes of delectable foods. Highly recommend.
Being from SoCal, my expectations were not terribly high going to a Mexican restaurant; frankly, I had no idea what to expect. Plus, most of the places in this district (Haight-Ashbury) seemed pretty less than exciting. However, this place could not have further surpassed my expectations. Their food was fresh, flavorful, and exceptional. In fact, I don't believe that SoCal fast-food type Mexican places match this quality. I'll definitely return. Their guacamole was excellent, their chicken well spiced, and the strawberry drink was killer. I will be back.
On a rainy day there's nothing like a burrito, I ordered it through door dash, the burrito got delivered in a timely manner and was still relatively warm.I ordered the super burrito with campechano, black beans and everything else it came with.  Let me start be saying that the black beans were nowhere to be found, this burrito was mostly rice and campechano, smh not so super for a super burrito.  Overall the flavor were good, however if we're doing the farolito comparison farolito definitely comes out on top.If I'm in the haight and I desperately want a burrito I'll probably stop by, however if I can I'd make the strech to the mission and go to la tequeria, el farolito or even taqueria cancun to fully satisfy my craving, however if those options are not feasible this place will do.
Call it arrogance, but having now spent three years as a resident of Dallas I've caught myself almost unknowingly fielding the opinion that there aren't any better tacos outside of the Texas state borders. Enter Street Taco, who slapped me right back down to earth some of the best authentic tacos I've had. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I walked through the doors of Street Taco. While the interior was nothing unlike what I commonly encounter back in Dallas, it all felt a bit strange strolling into an authentic Mexican taqueria in the midst of most groovy neighborhood in San Francisco. My hesitation was quickly washed away upon seeing the giant spinning spit full of pork and the other various meats being freshly prepared behind the counter. The process was simple: place your order at the counter, have a brief sit, and wait for your glorious meal to be procured at the counter. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?"$3.50 for a single taco? That seems a bit muc... Oh... oh my"This was pretty much my exact thought process as I watched the patrons in front of me get their order. Make no mistake - these tacos are absolutely massive. See that picture at the bottom of this review? Two tacos, although there may as well be four there. Considering the portion size and the menu breadth Street Tacos prices are nothing short of extraordinary given that this is San Francisco we're talking about, and value like that should be shouted from the mountain tops. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Oh yeah. I hinted as much in the beginning of this review, but these were some of the better authentic tacos I've had. Period. I opted for a steak taco and an al pastor taco, and my only regret was that I wasn't able to sample even more of the wonderful meats available at Street Taco. These were some of the freshest ingredients in the game, and they were served in generous quantities bundles together in freshly made tortillas. I'm usually not one for large quantities of salsa or cilantro, but both made the meats work all the more, and the aggregate flavor was excellent if I haven't already made that clear. Marvelous. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Without question or hesitation. Star Granted.
Came to use the bathroom! We were walking along Haight Ashbury, we had to go super bad and this was the only place we thought had a public restroom available. Not sure if you have to order food in order to use the bathroom, but we didn't care, nature calls! You order at the counter. I ordered a two street taco plate. I thought it was pricey for just two tacos, but I figured it must have a side of rice and beans. Nope, it was just two tacos. It's $7 for two but I ordered one with shrimp, which was a $1 extra. When our order came out, I wasn't impressed, the taco with shrimp had barely any shrimp, but a lot of shredded lettuce. The taco with carne Asada, was decent but I've had better back home, at a fraction of a cost. My disappointment is with their bathroom. It's only one stall. We had to pee super bad and the lighting sucks ass! My biggest gripe is that the toilet seat is off its hinges. Along with dim light, try wiping your ass on a wobbly seat. I almost fell off the seat, kinda gross when the boys get pee everywhere but in the commode! No Bueno! Put a repair order in, por favor, ASAP! You don't want someone busting their ass, trying to wipe it!
