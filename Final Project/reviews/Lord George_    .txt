Pre-Giants gameWith the crowds growing pre game, I was shocked that we were able to walk into venue and get a table.  If you are looking for some of the best craft cocktails, and fresh oysters, this is the place. Dreams Old Men Dream,  Cobra Kai, Rye Manhattan, all stellarThe freshest oysters, Duck Confit Tartine, and assorted meats and cheeses on a board. All amazing. I might also add , that service was impeccable !!This will be my go to, for any future games or events at the ballpark. Cheers
Cocktails - solid place to grab a cocktail. The menu of drink options is great and their execution is as good as it gets. I look forward to returning for oysters and food.
Their cocktail menu is off the chain, and their bartender was super nice. Best thing was, that place was pretty empty on a Sunday afternoon so we could just waltz right in with a group of ladies and snag a table. Yes, their cocktails are expensive but they're interesting and intricate and this is San Francisco.Also, oysters.
My new go-to happy hour spot! Inside is very clean and bright, I love the layout, it's definitely a good place to catch the game.We ordered:Oysters + Prawns: It was all very fresh and prawns were juicy! You can choose from different oysters, they have 3 different kinds, so we get four of each. Delicious, I prefer the big oysters. The Broads: SO good, definitely a good snack to munch on. You can mix and match. The meat inside had bits of pistachios, and cheese was super smooth and carrots were yummy with their green sauce!Bloody Mary: Some of the best blood mary I've have had, it's not too strong and has a great kick to it! Loved it.Cobra Kai: Delicious and fruity. It had hard liquor in the recipe, but you can't waste it at all.Fries: Thin and crispy and fresh out the over.Overall, love this place and service was great, the bartenders are super friendly and has great recommendations!
Lord George!! Trendy bar with a great setting. Seating at the bar or at one of the high tops. We went on a Saturday evening, around 6:30 and there were only a few people there. Then again, who eats at 6:30 in the City on a Saturday night?!Our server was friendly, courteous and helpful. We had a dozen of assorted oysters, fries, duck confit Tartine, steak & potatoes Tartine. Their Tartine is an open faced sandwich. Lord George's specialty drinks were infused with lots of flavor. I had the Cobra Kai and my GF had the Trampoline Jack. They had other specialty drinks that sounded interesting but I will save that for another visit.I mentioned no HH on weekends but they do have HH Mon-Fri from 4-6PM but not on game nights. AT&T Park is a few blocks away. Good place to have a pre game drink. Great for groups.The only complaint I have is that they charged us a SF Mandate fee.  I understand why they have it but if they embedded that charge in the price of the food, I wouldn't be that bitter about it. Lol!!
What is not to like about this place?+  Excellent happy hour+  Quality oysters+  Charcuterie+  Craft cocktails+  Small batch brews+  Decent winesWe ate and drank our hearts content during happy hour, and it came out to about $40 a head.
Good neighborhood bar.Tasty bar food,stiff drinks and friendly bartenders.FAVE DRINK:DREAMS OLD MEN DREAM
The bartender was super SUPER nice, gave us some pretty classy and delicious beverages, and the oysters were fresh and delicious. I did get one oyster that had that hint of meh flavor, but out of a dozen, the rest were all as fresh and delicious as is oysterly possible (see what I did there? you'd better be chuckling).  They offer cocktail sauce, onion champagne sauce, and some kind of garlicky soy saucey sauce for putting on your oysters. It is nice to switch up the flavors a little bit, and the sauces all go perfect with oyster.The prices are for hipsters and techies, but the quality is also quite high, and it was a nice place to splurge on some excellent oysters and excellent drinks.
The bar area has a polished quaint charm serving a wide variety of cocktails and range of spirit choices Food wise, they offer fresh seafood and typical bar staplesDrinks are made well with a strong finish Seating can be challenging when it gets packed Overall ThoughtsA great bar to sit down with friends over drinks
My coworkers and I were "going up on a Tuesday" (did I use this correctly? I don't think I'm as hip as I used to be...) at Lord George since it is conveniently located a block away. It definitely reminds me of a smaller and more mature looking Southside Spirit House.5pm on a Tuesday, the whole place was packed. Crazy! I guess everyone had the same idea as us. Although it says they don't take reservations on Yelp, a few tables in the back were reserved. They have 2 TVs, so yay sports!Happy Hour (4pm-6pm):- 1/2 off oysters (oysters are normally $3)- $4 Trumer- $7 cava- $8 roseTheir beers on tap are around $6-8, and they have my second favorite beer (Black Butte Porter)! Simple and fancy cocktails cost around $10-13. The difference? The fancy cocktails have a few more ingredients than the simple ones. Recommendations:- Cobra Kai ($12): Japanese whiskey, cocoa, ancho chile, vino aperitivo, citrus, honey, bitters. - Gold Rush ($11) bourbon, lemon, honey.These two are very popular! A bit on the sweet side.- Oxford Comma ($13): armagnac, aged rum, French and Italian Vermouth, grenadine, bitters.- Snake Bite Kit ($12): mezcal, tequila, Galliano, grapefruit, lime, bitters.This was very easy to drink. A bit too light for my taste!- Dreams Old Men Dream ($12): Manhattan, negroni, Old Fashioned, combined!This dream sounds like the dream! Smokey and overall a great drink!Besides drinks, they also serve oysters and food. The food items are definitely on the pricey side, and they're not full meals, just light bar bites. The bartenders at Lord George seem like the cool kind of bartenders you want to be great buddies with! Cheers to new and awesome bars!
20 of us stopped in for brunch on a Sunday around 11, and they were able to accommodate us pretty effortlessly (5 stars for service and ambiance). I had the baked eggs, which were pretty good (3 stars), but the huge smoked salmon tartine looked even better! Would love to try it next time. I've also been here once for cocktails on a weeknight and really liked the vibe and the fact that it was not too loud so you can easily have a conversation and actually hear each other.
4 stars for your yummy, yummy oysters! Thanks for not skimping out on the portions. Yes, some of them were tiny, shriveled, little puked-up-lookin' pieces of animal. But hey, most of them were a mouthful! :3 Definitely satiated my cravings. Knocked off a star for the spoilt cabernet sauvignon. I thought I hit a jackpot when they filled up half my cup (chu know those establishments that give you that taster sized cup of wine lol). But alas, twas because it was no bueno! :( I'd go again though. Their lemon drink with bourbon or whatever the hell it was with that spicy kick to it was pretty intense- a must try, I'd say.
Can't go wrong with happy hour dollar oysters! They were very fresh and delish! They usually offer at least four different kinds. Generous portions for the clam chowder and it tasted very bacon-ish. I'll recommend to order less or one dish at a time to avoid wasting food.No reservation needed on weekdays. The girl waitress seem confused and a bit slow. Try to sit at the bar for better service.
Charcuterie board here is huge if you get the 5 option for $30. The opened face sandwiches were decent. Nothing amazing. Cocktails are strong and tasty. The drinks were definitely something I'd come back for. The happy hour is only on a few things. If you like oysters, this place is good for happy hour as they are half off.
Stopped in here for a drink and was presently surprised by the atmosphere, service, and drink selection. Might be a bit premature to give it a 5-star rating after only spending 30-minutes inside, but first impressions are everything. Right?I'm a big Old Fashioned connoisseur. So naturally, when I saw a drink that encompasses an Old Fashioned, Manhattan, AND a Negroni, I was intrigued! And, I wasn't disappointment - it was yummy.They also have a raw bar and a really good looking charcuterie (you can select what you want as well - cheese, meat, and veggie options).Check this place out, I think you'll be a fan, too!
First time at this lovely/quaint bar. Definitely coming back again. The drink menu is superb and the bar tender--Adam--is just as impressive. He is very attentive and knows how to  work the crowd effectively and humorously. The food was great (dunk confit bahn mi!!!)amongst many other carnivorous choices. Well done Lord George!
Because 21st Amendment is always packed... Lord George ups the ante with great classic cocktails with a twist, oysters and finger foods. The service runs a little slow if you are at one of the open tables, especially when busy. But if its slow and you're at the bar, service is top notch. They do serve coffee, even though its not on the menu. The chef recommended cheese and meat platter was delicious. Drinks were strong and had great profiles. If I'm ever in the area, would definitely love to come back for their happy hour!
A relatively new addition to SOMA and the ATT Park gateway, Lord George is very welcome in my book. It's a much needed elevation of craft cocktails, oysters and charcuterie boards in a neighborhood surrounded with beer bars and baseball pregame spots (not that there's anything wrong with that). Formerly NOVA (a diver where I used to drink branca and coors light before Giants games), I'm fully behind this concept as the space is better utilized and more people can enjoy the plethora of options behind the bar. Happy Hour (4pm-6pm) is legit. - 1/2 off oysters - $4 Trumer- $7 cava (spanish for sparkling wine/champagne)- $8 roseA toast to the new kid on the block!
I give 5 stars based amazing drinks they have. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly as well. I would say this place has the best cocktails I had in SF. Thumbs up!
Stopped for an afternoon snack. Found it on Yelp. Was a little hard to find but we were walking so it's not like we had to drive around the block for a while. The food and service was very good.Would recommend!

AT&T Park is a few blocks away. Good place to have a pre game drink. Great for groups.The only complaint I have is that they charged us a SF Mandate fee.  I understand why they have it but if they embedded that charge in the price of the food, I wouldn't be that bitter about it. Lol!!
What is not to like about this place?+  Excellent happy hour+  Quality oysters+  Charcuterie+  Craft cocktails+  Small batch brews+  Decent winesWe ate and drank our hearts content during happy hour, and it came out to about $40 a head.
Good neighborhood bar.Tasty bar food,stiff drinks and friendly bartenders.FAVE DRINK:DREAMS OLD MEN DREAM
The bartender was super SUPER nice, gave us some pretty classy and delicious beverages, and the oysters were fresh and delicious. I did get one oyster that had that hint of meh flavor, but out of a dozen, the rest were all as fresh and delicious as is oysterly possible (see what I did there? you'd better be chuckling).  They offer cocktail sauce, onion champagne sauce, and some kind of garlicky soy saucey sauce for putting on your oysters. It is nice to switch up the flavors a little bit, and the sauces all go perfect with oyster.The prices are for hipsters and techies, but the quality is also quite high, and it was a nice place to splurge on some excellent oysters and excellent drinks.
The bar area has a polished quaint charm serving a wide variety of cocktails and range of spirit choices Food wise, they offer fresh seafood and typical bar staplesDrinks are made well with a strong finish Seating can be challenging when it gets packed Overall ThoughtsA great bar to sit down with friends over drinks
My coworkers and I were "going up on a Tuesday" (did I use this correctly? I don't think I'm as hip as I used to be...) at Lord George since it is conveniently located a block away. It definitely reminds me of a smaller and more mature looking Southside Spirit House.5pm on a Tuesday, the whole place was packed. Crazy! I guess everyone had the same idea as us. Although it says they don't take reservations on Yelp, a few tables in the back were reserved. They have 2 TVs, so yay sports!Happy Hour (4pm-6pm):- 1/2 off oysters (oysters are normally $3)- $4 Trumer- $7 cava- $8 roseTheir beers on tap are around $6-8, and they have my second favorite beer (Black Butte Porter)! Simple and fancy cocktails cost around $10-13. The difference? The fancy cocktails have a few more ingredients than the simple ones. Recommendations:- Cobra Kai ($12): Japanese whiskey, cocoa, ancho chile, vino aperitivo, citrus, honey, bitters. - Gold Rush ($11) bourbon, lemon, honey.These two are very popular! A bit on the sweet side.- Oxford Comma ($13): armagnac, aged rum, French and Italian Vermouth, grenadine, bitters.- Snake Bite Kit ($12): mezcal, tequila, Galliano, grapefruit, lime, bitters.This was very easy to drink. A bit too light for my taste!- Dreams Old Men Dream ($12): Manhattan, negroni, Old Fashioned, combined!This dream sounds like the dream! Smokey and overall a great drink!Besides drinks, they also serve oysters and food. The food items are definitely on the pricey side, and they're not full meals, just light bar bites. The bartenders at Lord George seem like the cool kind of bartenders you want to be great buddies with! Cheers to new and awesome bars!
20 of us stopped in for brunch on a Sunday around 11, and they were able to accommodate us pretty effortlessly (5 stars for service and ambiance). I had the baked eggs, which were pretty good (3 stars), but the huge smoked salmon tartine looked even better! Would love to try it next time. I've also been here once for cocktails on a weeknight and really liked the vibe and the fact that it was not too loud so you can easily have a conversation and actually hear each other.
4 stars for your yummy, yummy oysters! Thanks for not skimping out on the portions. Yes, some of them were tiny, shriveled, little puked-up-lookin' pieces of animal. But hey, most of them were a mouthful! :3 Definitely satiated my cravings. Knocked off a star for the spoilt cabernet sauvignon. I thought I hit a jackpot when they filled up half my cup (chu know those establishments that give you that taster sized cup of wine lol). But alas, twas because it was no bueno! :( I'd go again though. Their lemon drink with bourbon or whatever the hell it was with that spicy kick to it was pretty intense- a must try, I'd say.
Can't go wrong with happy hour dollar oysters! They were very fresh and delish! They usually offer at least four different kinds. Generous portions for the clam chowder and it tasted very bacon-ish. I'll recommend to order less or one dish at a time to avoid wasting food.No reservation needed on weekdays. The girl waitress seem confused and a bit slow. Try to sit at the bar for better service.
Charcuterie board here is huge if you get the 5 option for $30. The opened face sandwiches were decent. Nothing amazing. Cocktails are strong and tasty. The drinks were definitely something I'd come back for. The happy hour is only on a few things. If you like oysters, this place is good for happy hour as they are half off.
Stopped in here for a drink and was presently surprised by the atmosphere, service, and drink selection. Might be a bit premature to give it a 5-star rating after only spending 30-minutes inside, but first impressions are everything. Right?I'm a big Old Fashioned connoisseur. So naturally, when I saw a drink that encompasses an Old Fashioned, Manhattan, AND a Negroni, I was intrigued! And, I wasn't disappointment - it was yummy.They also have a raw bar and a really good looking charcuterie (you can select what you want as well - cheese, meat, and veggie options).Check this place out, I think you'll be a fan, too!
First time at this lovely/quaint bar. Definitely coming back again. The drink menu is superb and the bar tender--Adam--is just as impressive. He is very attentive and knows how to  work the crowd effectively and humorously. The food was great (dunk confit bahn mi!!!)amongst many other carnivorous choices. Well done Lord George!
Because 21st Amendment is always packed... Lord George ups the ante with great classic cocktails with a twist, oysters and finger foods. The service runs a little slow if you are at one of the open tables, especially when busy. But if its slow and you're at the bar, service is top notch. They do serve coffee, even though its not on the menu. The chef recommended cheese and meat platter was delicious. Drinks were strong and had great profiles. If I'm ever in the area, would definitely love to come back for their happy hour!
A relatively new addition to SOMA and the ATT Park gateway, Lord George is very welcome in my book. It's a much needed elevation of craft cocktails, oysters and charcuterie boards in a neighborhood surrounded with beer bars and baseball pregame spots (not that there's anything wrong with that). Formerly NOVA (a diver where I used to drink branca and coors light before Giants games), I'm fully behind this concept as the space is better utilized and more people can enjoy the plethora of options behind the bar. Happy Hour (4pm-6pm) is legit. - 1/2 off oysters - $4 Trumer- $7 cava (spanish for sparkling wine/champagne)- $8 roseA toast to the new kid on the block!
I give 5 stars based amazing drinks they have. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly as well. I would say this place has the best cocktails I had in SF. Thumbs up!
Stopped for an afternoon snack. Found it on Yelp. Was a little hard to find but we were walking so it's not like we had to drive around the block for a while. The food and service was very good.Would recommend!
