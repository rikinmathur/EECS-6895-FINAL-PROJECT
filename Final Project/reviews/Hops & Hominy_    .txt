Upscale Southern comfort food in an alley restaurant. The bunny logo marks the entryway to the trendy venue with a storybook drawing on the wall. From the looks of the narrow alley, I would not have guessed the space to be so spacious with a full bar and dining room. Their fried chicken is one of the more popular items on the menu, but I don't usually find myself too impressed with $$-$$$ fried chicken.The complimentary skillet cornbread, $3 on the menu, was served in a cast-iron bread pan alongside some creamy butter. It was warm, a rather generous serving, and easily one of the best complimentary items I ever received from a restaurant.$8 Black-Eyed Pea Fritters - jalapeno, serrano, leeks, onions, carrots, herb aioli:These were plenty spicy. The herb aioli was tasty, but the fritters were packed with flavor already.In the past, I've also tried their steak sandwich and squid ink pasta with clams. The sandwich was tasty and filling, but the steak a little tough. The squid ink noodles were not bad, but it was sitting in some super salty broth. If I return, I'd try the pork chop or the Southern carbonara, since it is one of my favorite pasta dishes. Overall, I give it a 7/10 for decent food and a nice setting.
Love this southern comfort food in San Francisco. Very central location 2-3 blocks from union square in a little alley way. The restaurant has expanded and opened up a larger building right next door that has the full menu but only serves beer and wine.Great cocktails, beers on tap, and bottled beers for a Friday night. For food I would recommend the friend oysters (amazing sauce) and the mac and cheese (takes you back to those good old kraft days in elementary school) except this dish is literally 15x better.For main courses you can't go wrong with the fried chicken!The place gets pretty packed up I would highly recommend calling in to put your name on the list or make reservations ahead of time.
This place is situated in an alley type nook. If it wasn't for me my husband would've gotten lost (he's terrible with directions) I found it easily enough. We didn't have reservations so our little restaurant was on the side not the one all the way in the back. The place looked really nice and it even had a fireplace (it wasn't cold so there was no need for it to be on but I would've liked to see it on) it was clean and the staff was really nice. My husband ordered the fried chicken plate for himself and to share with our 1 year old. Both loved the chicken very much. I ordered the sea bass and it was sooooo good! The price was pretty high for the serving I received but I wasn't ravenous so I really did get full from what I ordered and enjoyed it so much. My husband and son were also really happy with their dinner. Also, I'd like to point out that my son can get loud and get frustrated at restaurants but nobody complained and their were two ladies (workers) that spoke with him and played a little while waiting for things to be done and he calmed down. I wish I could remember their names but to those two ladies. Thank you!
The first thing you'll notice about this place when you walk in is how loud it is. For some reason, everyone's voice just bounces off the wall and you probably won't be able to hear the person sitting across from you LOL legit came out of the restaurant with muffly ears.Aside from the loud atmosphere, the food here is not bad! My dad got the pork chop which was just pink enough where it's cooked except for this one part near the bone that was completely red. Just be careful when you're eating the pork! I got their burger which was very yummy and filling. I even added an egg for an extra dollar. The burger comes with ketchup and fries too! We shared the fried oyster appetizer that comes with a jalapeño aioli dip which we loved. All food comes with freshly baked cornbread too! And our waitress was super nice :) Had a great time here!
While touring San Francisco, we stopped in at Hops & Hominy for a couple beers during the happiest of hours. The bartender was super nice and friendly, and was happy to help us pick out a beer that most spoke to our hearts (as they do). Beer selection was really good, with some standards that are more common as well as some beers that are less so. Mostly local-brewery focused with a few interlopers, they have eight rotating taps to choose from.The food that wandered by on its way to other people's tables looked really good, but a glance at the menu didn't reveal anything that particularly spoke to us. This might have been because of the weather--it was super hot outside and thus sweltering inside. That's not really a time when you're looking to eat hot, filling Southern food. If I had to go back, though, that macaroni and cheese looked pretty off the hook.
Tucked away in a short street (Tillman Pl), the restaurant is casual with a robust list of brewskies and comfort foods at affordable prices. Our dishes were all tasty but the level of uniqueness/craving for more was varied. This is a 3.5/5 in my book.Black eyed pea fritters - As a heavier starter, try to pace yourself because this  spicy, deep fried goodness will lure you back for more.Lamb shank  - This wasn't quite what I was expecting. I thought this would be a large piece of meat but instead the meat was in "meatball" form on top a mix of roasted veggies. The dish was ok but I didn't come away from it with the typical fall-off of the bone/melt in your mouth tender meat sensation.  Seafood stew  - Rich creole-flavored broth with an assortment of seafood surprises. Save some of the complimentary corn bread to soak up the sauce. This dish screams for a side dish of grits or more grilled bread (a la mussels/frites style).Fried chicken & biscuit - A little underwhelming but this probably satisfies a craving for fried chicken for most. You get a good sized chicken breast and drumstick with a side of biscuit and a creamy veggie. I would've liked something a little lighter/brighter as a side dish to counter balance the deep fried chicken.
I was meeting up with a friend after a conference I went to at Moscone Center so I wanted to stay in the general area since I needed to take Bart back all the way to Pleasanton so I didn't want to go too far out of the way or drive/uber it somewhere. After some searching, I picked this place. My friend has never been either. He lives in Oakland and is usually quite busy so he's not in the City much unless he needs to be. It was definitely a place you'd miss if you weren't paying attention. It's down an ally way so blink and you'll miss it. Overall love the ambience. Nice bar plus someseating. I was able to make an open table res the same day hours before we went to dinner on a Tuesday at 7. Make a res. This place isn't huge so if you don't have one you could easy wait for a while. We were in the back corner but it was fine for us since we didn't feel like we weren't  bothering anyone or in anyone's way. I ended up with the fried chicken and my friend got mac and cheese and shrimp and grits. We both loved our selections. I personally don't like collared greens I was hoping I might like these but I should have really asked for a different side. The fried chicken however was great. Great crust nice seasoning. My friend felt that the shrimp and grits he got were the best he's had. Cornbread was served complementary. I did end up with some dessert and got the profiteroles and a cappuccino. Word to the wise, they have whole milk only. No non dairy options or different levels of fat. Overall great company great food. Will be back again. The brunch looks good!
This place is as sub par as it gets.We came here given the strong reviews we saw on Yelp.  Unfortunately, our experience didn't live up to it. The service was great. Our waitress was very smiley and helpful, but it wasn't until 10 minutes after we were seated that anyone paid any attention to us. I had to grab our hostess and her response was "oh, yes! A waitress. Let me get you one." Other than this, our service was great.But that was the highlight. The food was another story. We started with the black eyed peas fritters. At first site, they looked awesome. When biting in, we were greeted with a relatively bland filling. I couldn't really tell what the flavor was. The fact that is was fried made the dish palatable.The main course was just as underwhelming. I had the sea bass and my gf had the fried chicken. The fried chicken had almost no personality. I hate to say it, but KFC would have been a better option. The chicken itself was dry underneath the breaded coating, and the fried coating was bland. I'm no chef and hate to say it but, a little salt and pepper wouldn't hurt.The Sea bass was meh. I didn't finish it. It was cooked well and was a pretty good portion. Beyond this, not much to rave about.
This place was recommended to us. To make longer story short:We went here for dinner, however this is also a bar with sticky floors and noisy guests. Really really noisy guests. The food was also disappointing. I had chicken. It was really just chicken with something tasteless and lots of bone. Worst SF meal ever had.
FACT: The restaurant was named Hops & Hominy for the beer they serve (Hops) and the kernels they use in their grits (Hominy).Since my sis brought her dog, we sat outside, which was way better because it was just so noisy and warm indoors!  It was me, her, and a friend who came here on a Thursday night to catch up over dinner!We had:SKILLET CORNBREAD - ComplimentaryThis came out on a small iron skillet and served with orange blossom honey butter.  Presentation: great! Taste: meh. It tasted freaky dry no matter how much of that whipped butter I stabbed on.  The cornmeal in it really didn't help.  I didn't care for that extra grainy and gritty texture. Kind of glad I didn't pay for it.MAC & CHEESE - $9cast iron baked, sharp mornay, house-smoked bacon, breadcrumbs.Ah yes, now here's something yummy and beautiful that's server in an iron skillet! This was pretty decent--everything you can expect in a mac n cheese--thick creamy sauce, amazing texture from the breadcrumbs, and extra savory-ness and flavor from the bacon!  SHRIMP & GRITS - $22jumbo Gulf shrimp, house-cured tasso, stone ground grits, tomato brandy sauce, jalapeno.This...was okay.  I love grits and although the texture was fine, the flavors kind of threw me off. I think it was the tomato brandy that I mostly tasted--bitter and tangy, but maybe some people like that kind of kick.  It was mildly spicy and the shrimp was fine.  Overall just okay.FRIED CHICKEN - $21+$3 for 3rd pieceRocky Jr. free range chicken, creamed collard greens, buttermilk biscuit, pepper sauce.This dish comes with 2 pieces of yummy fried chicken, and wince there is 3 of us, we added one more for $3.  Not bad, right?  The chicken was moist even though it was mostly white meat.  The crispy skin was flavorful and not overly doughy not thick--it's how fried chicken should be!  I really enjoyed the tiny scoop of creamy collard greens because...it was creamy! So that made it less bitter in taste and not so salty from the pork in it.  The jackpot was fine--not the best I had but it was good enough!COCONUT PECAN PIE - $8Salted Caramel I've been fooled! This is no pie! It says pie but it's really a 4-layer cake with coconut frosting in between each thin layer.  It is topped with a salted caramel sauce, which u wish there was more of because the cake was just okay.  I say okay because I was expecting, and wanting pie. :P the candied pecan pieces and toasted coconut on the side was a nice touch...but darn it pie would have been nice...okay I'll stop :POverall this place is just okay.  Service was decent and the seating. Outdoors was nice, although chilly.  It's located in a nice quite alley though.  It's pretty pricy for the amount and quality of food.  I still enjoyed myself enough overall though.
Yum! This place is delicious!  Its a little hidden restaurant in an alley way. Busy, so make a reservation if you can! We we're very happy with our meal and can't wait to come back the only bad thing was the beer my husband got at the bar. The bartender only filled the glass 3/4 of the way. I attached a pic of it! Mussels appetizer: honestly the best mussels we've had in a while. The sauce was so good, I could have picked up the bowl to drink it and the shellfish was so fresh.Mac & cheese: creamy, savory, tangy wonderfulness Fried chicken: perfectly cooked and moist. Came with two pieces and Collard greens.Flat iron steak: cooked just like we ordered it.  Good seasoning and came with crispy potatoes
The short: decent burger in a very loud post-work atmosphereThis place is hidden in an alley and you'll likely to miss it if you're not looking for it. Head straight down and step right in! This place was crowded on a Tuesday night. My friend had arrived first and mentioned that the wait was over 1/2 hr! Then, she suggested the bar, which I was fine with because it was only the two of us.I browsed the menu and one of the few things I could afford was the Hops & Hominy burger. It was cooked to a wonderful medium rare (my preference) and the fries were great too. I thought that the raw onions on the side were a turn-off, and while the bartender gave us great service and my friend and I had the chance to chat about life, I wouldn't come here for just the burgers when there are better places around.The bathroom is unique. The wallpaper has women's faces that are covered in lipstick? And the washbasin is outside the toilet room.
I'm an out-of-towner generally on business but always eat and play somewhere unique to the areas I visit. I was staying at the Drake Hotel and used Yelp as always. Hops and Hominy reviews sounded pretty damn good. So here we go.The place is nicely setup and has a great vibe, dark but trendy and alive. Before you can get there, you must walk through an alley that is a standard big city type.  This place is much nicer in person and you should give it a go and here's why:Looking at the menu, which often changes, we decided on the Mac and Cheese for an app. We ordered the Fried Chicken and and the Crawfish Stew. Before your food arrives a fresh, hot mini iron skillet cornbread is brought to your table alongside a honey butter.The cornbread is a nice warmup biteThe Mac and Cheese featured an aldente rigata macaroni  pasta with a silky white cheese sauce.  A crispy cheese top with a bread crumb and bacon crumble gets toasted and that seals the deal.Fried Chicken is amazing. Crispy and tender thigh and drumstick served with some creamy collards. A biscuit near the chicken is a tasty bite as well.The Crawfish Stew was a different story. Although the broth was flavorful and tasty, the Crawfish and Prawn were way over cooked. The mussels and clams wre very good but again, the crawfish (the star) were so over cooked they were mushy. Thia was served with toast with cheese on top  which added a tomato soup and grilled cheese feel, which wasn't a bad thing. But overall, disappointed in that dish.As for service, the plaid laden staff were decent and did serve us someone else's order at first. I can tell you this though, the mussels dish on the looks amazing especially when it landed on my table mistakenly.  The waitress we had, a skinny, Caucasian girl, asked how everything was.  I told her about the overcooked Crawfish and prawn, and she seemed to not care and kind of gave me anything else look. Service just average in my opinion. Food is pretty much a can't missing the city and I would eat here again based on that alone.
Riesling was amazing! Cornbread was so so, but tasted amazing with the whipped butter! Sea bass was so so as well, just wasn't too flavorful and was relatively simple. I felt hungry afterwards still. BUTTT the mac and cheese was OMG, super delicious! You have to come here for the mac and cheese, and eat it while it's still hot!Ambient was nice, service was on point, and overall a good place for drinks and dinner.
Hops & hominy is southern food restaurant located in a cute little alleyway in San Francisco, totally walkable from Bart. I'm a huge fan of southern food so I was really excited to try this restaurant out. I highly recommend making a reservation during dinner hours because it does get busy.The waiters all wear plaid which I thought was super cute, to go with the southern theme. Service is great, they constantly ask you how you are doing and refill your water.They also start you off with a huge delicious freshly baked corn bread in a pan. The cornbread is super moist and buttery! (4/5)I ordered the hamachi crudo and shrimp & grits. Both were pretty amazing!Hamachi crudo (5/5)Their hamachi sashimi appetizer is nicely marinated with a bed of greens on top. They give you a pretty sizable portion and the fish is extremely fresh and tender. It was probably better than similar dishes served at sushi restaurants! Shrimp & grits (5/5)This was such a delicious dish! The grits were extremely creamy and cheesy, but not too overwhelmingly heavy. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce they use was incredible. I thought the plate was a bit small when it first arrived, but it is actually very filling. High recommend this! The food is a bit on the pricier side, but very good. Definitely will be back to try the fried chicken!
Great restaurant and vibe.  The menu is modern southern but doesn't alienate you if you're not into southern.  They also offer a few light Italian/California inspired dishes.  They've got a large selection of beers, wine, and cocktails at reasonable prices.  We had the shrimp and grits, hamachi crudo, and a gem Caesar salad.  The cornbread with butter cream was amazing!  Everything was delicious and the portions were fair.  I'd definitely be back.
Damn, I really wanted to hate this place since I work 50ft away, but bless their southern hearts, the food is really good!We've had the beef heart tartare, the fried chicken, the pork chop and the burgers and EVERYTHING has been spot on.  The fried chicken was flavorful without being over spiced.  The pork chop was perfectly pink on the inside and not overcooked at ALL and the tartare left me wanting more.Their corn bread is an amazing starter. Cocktails are well thought out and tasty.Prices are totally fair.   Downside: loud and busy.  Good for them.  However if you can get a table at the cafe or sit outside, you've got it made!!With so many restaurants in the area catering to tourists, I actually feel like I can get a decent meal without spending a fortune at H&H.
I amr here Saturday at 6:30 w 7ppl. We made a reservation.We shared a salad and ordered a main separately. I had a big lunch so I shared main w my female friend. Our main was lamb cheeks. 5 cheeks w warm veggies. Cheeks are so tender and tasty. Veggies and cream is gentle taste. I liked it. The price was $23 per person w/o drinks. Not expensive.The thing I like is the atmosphere and decoration, furniture of this place. So cool. I recommend for a small party or meet up.The server was nice enough to give as hot water and lemon.
Found this spot on Yelp And open table. Reviews were amazing so I thought I'd try it as I was staying nearby. Was disappointed that the online menu was not up to date and that the "southern carbonara" wasn't on the menu.  The complimentary corn bread was good and the butter melted on contact. Opted for the fried chicken, which was a small portion with just a breast and a leg. For a $3 up charge, you can get an extra piece of dark meat. The meat was juicy and tender. The skin was crunchy and well seasoned. House made hot sauce was a great addition. Came with a paltry side of collard greens. They were creamy and delicious, but incredibly sparse. Also a buttermilk biscuit but I Can't vouch for the taste since I didn't partake. A good number of draught beers, but many hoppy options (obviously) and a number of sours. For a fan of darker beers, there were only two draught a options, a tasty imperial stout and a spiced brown ale that tasted just like old fashioned root beer.Also, my food came out way to fast. I was looking for a relaxing sit down after a long day of traveling. Usually people complain about slow service, but I feel that hops and hominy wanted to turn tables quickly. I was seated shortly after 5pm and was settling the check and walking out about 25 minutes later.  Overall, decent food, but very pricey for what you get. I know San Francisco is expensive, but almost $40 for two pieces of fried chicken, a paltry side dish and one beer (including tip) is ridiculous. I might recommend Hops and Hominy to "hopheads" and beer snobs for happy hour maybe. But then again, I'm not sure if they have any happy hour specials.
This place was delicious. A little loud but an awesome vibe. The food was like glorified bar food. We got the mac and cheese, risotto, and the black eyed pea fritters. All were amazing. The free cornbread that was served att be beginning of the meal was also delicious. The drinks were amazing too. I had gotten a spicy jalapeño one as well as one with Sailor Jerrys in it (I don't remember the names) but both were delicious. I am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in San Fran

Came with two pieces and Collard greens.Flat iron steak: cooked just like we ordered it.  Good seasoning and came with crispy potatoes
The short: decent burger in a very loud post-work atmosphereThis place is hidden in an alley and you'll likely to miss it if you're not looking for it. Head straight down and step right in! This place was crowded on a Tuesday night. My friend had arrived first and mentioned that the wait was over 1/2 hr! Then, she suggested the bar, which I was fine with because it was only the two of us.I browsed the menu and one of the few things I could afford was the Hops & Hominy burger. It was cooked to a wonderful medium rare (my preference) and the fries were great too. I thought that the raw onions on the side were a turn-off, and while the bartender gave us great service and my friend and I had the chance to chat about life, I wouldn't come here for just the burgers when there are better places around.The bathroom is unique. The wallpaper has women's faces that are covered in lipstick? And the washbasin is outside the toilet room.
I'm an out-of-towner generally on business but always eat and play somewhere unique to the areas I visit. I was staying at the Drake Hotel and used Yelp as always. Hops and Hominy reviews sounded pretty damn good. So here we go.The place is nicely setup and has a great vibe, dark but trendy and alive. Before you can get there, you must walk through an alley that is a standard big city type.  This place is much nicer in person and you should give it a go and here's why:Looking at the menu, which often changes, we decided on the Mac and Cheese for an app. We ordered the Fried Chicken and and the Crawfish Stew. Before your food arrives a fresh, hot mini iron skillet cornbread is brought to your table alongside a honey butter.The cornbread is a nice warmup biteThe Mac and Cheese featured an aldente rigata macaroni  pasta with a silky white cheese sauce.  A crispy cheese top with a bread crumb and bacon crumble gets toasted and that seals the deal.Fried Chicken is amazing. Crispy and tender thigh and drumstick served with some creamy collards. A biscuit near the chicken is a tasty bite as well.The Crawfish Stew was a different story. Although the broth was flavorful and tasty, the Crawfish and Prawn were way over cooked. The mussels and clams wre very good but again, the crawfish (the star) were so over cooked they were mushy. Thia was served with toast with cheese on top  which added a tomato soup and grilled cheese feel, which wasn't a bad thing. But overall, disappointed in that dish.As for service, the plaid laden staff were decent and did serve us someone else's order at first. I can tell you this though, the mussels dish on the looks amazing especially when it landed on my table mistakenly.  The waitress we had, a skinny, Caucasian girl, asked how everything was.  I told her about the overcooked Crawfish and prawn, and she seemed to not care and kind of gave me anything else look. Service just average in my opinion. Food is pretty much a can't missing the city and I would eat here again based on that alone.
Riesling was amazing! Cornbread was so so, but tasted amazing with the whipped butter! Sea bass was so so as well, just wasn't too flavorful and was relatively simple. I felt hungry afterwards still. BUTTT the mac and cheese was OMG, super delicious! You have to come here for the mac and cheese, and eat it while it's still hot!Ambient was nice, service was on point, and overall a good place for drinks and dinner.
Hops & hominy is southern food restaurant located in a cute little alleyway in San Francisco, totally walkable from Bart. I'm a huge fan of southern food so I was really excited to try this restaurant out. I highly recommend making a reservation during dinner hours because it does get busy.The waiters all wear plaid which I thought was super cute, to go with the southern theme. Service is great, they constantly ask you how you are doing and refill your water.They also start you off with a huge delicious freshly baked corn bread in a pan. The cornbread is super moist and buttery! (4/5)I ordered the hamachi crudo and shrimp & grits. Both were pretty amazing!Hamachi crudo (5/5)Their hamachi sashimi appetizer is nicely marinated with a bed of greens on top. They give you a pretty sizable portion and the fish is extremely fresh and tender. It was probably better than similar dishes served at sushi restaurants! Shrimp & grits (5/5)This was such a delicious dish! The grits were extremely creamy and cheesy, but not too overwhelmingly heavy. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce they use was incredible. I thought the plate was a bit small when it first arrived, but it is actually very filling. High recommend this! The food is a bit on the pricier side, but very good. Definitely will be back to try the fried chicken!
Great restaurant and vibe.  The menu is modern southern but doesn't alienate you if you're not into southern.  They also offer a few light Italian/California inspired dishes.  They've got a large selection of beers, wine, and cocktails at reasonable prices.  We had the shrimp and grits, hamachi crudo, and a gem Caesar salad.  The cornbread with butter cream was amazing!  Everything was delicious and the portions were fair.  I'd definitely be back.
Damn, I really wanted to hate this place since I work 50ft away, but bless their southern hearts, the food is really good!We've had the beef heart tartare, the fried chicken, the pork chop and the burgers and EVERYTHING has been spot on.  The fried chicken was flavorful without being over spiced.  The pork chop was perfectly pink on the inside and not overcooked at ALL and the tartare left me wanting more.Their corn bread is an amazing starter. Cocktails are well thought out and tasty.Prices are totally fair.   Downside: loud and busy.  Good for them.  However if you can get a table at the cafe or sit outside, you've got it made!!With so many restaurants in the area catering to tourists, I actually feel like I can get a decent meal without spending a fortune at H&H.
I amr here Saturday at 6:30 w 7ppl. We made a reservation.We shared a salad and ordered a main separately. I had a big lunch so I shared main w my female friend. Our main was lamb cheeks. 5 cheeks w warm veggies. Cheeks are so tender and tasty. Veggies and cream is gentle taste. I liked it. The price was $23 per person w/o drinks. Not expensive.The thing I like is the atmosphere and decoration, furniture of this place. So cool. I recommend for a small party or meet up.The server was nice enough to give as hot water and lemon.
Found this spot on Yelp And open table. Reviews were amazing so I thought I'd try it as I was staying nearby. Was disappointed that the online menu was not up to date and that the "southern carbonara" wasn't on the menu.  The complimentary corn bread was good and the butter melted on contact. Opted for the fried chicken, which was a small portion with just a breast and a leg. For a $3 up charge, you can get an extra piece of dark meat. The meat was juicy and tender. The skin was crunchy and well seasoned. House made hot sauce was a great addition. Came with a paltry side of collard greens. They were creamy and delicious, but incredibly sparse. Also a buttermilk biscuit but I Can't vouch for the taste since I didn't partake. A good number of draught beers, but many hoppy options (obviously) and a number of sours. For a fan of darker beers, there were only two draught a options, a tasty imperial stout and a spiced brown ale that tasted just like old fashioned root beer.Also, my food came out way to fast. I was looking for a relaxing sit down after a long day of traveling. Usually people complain about slow service, but I feel that hops and hominy wanted to turn tables quickly. I was seated shortly after 5pm and was settling the check and walking out about 25 minutes later.  Overall, decent food, but very pricey for what you get. I know San Francisco is expensive, but almost $40 for two pieces of fried chicken, a paltry side dish and one beer (including tip) is ridiculous. I might recommend Hops and Hominy to "hopheads" and beer snobs for happy hour maybe. But then again, I'm not sure if they have any happy hour specials.
This place was delicious. A little loud but an awesome vibe. The food was like glorified bar food. We got the mac and cheese, risotto, and the black eyed pea fritters. All were amazing. The free cornbread that was served att be beginning of the meal was also delicious. The drinks were amazing too. I had gotten a spicy jalapeño one as well as one with Sailor Jerrys in it (I don't remember the names) but both were delicious. I am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in San Fran
Upscale Southern comfort food in an alley restaurant. The bunny logo marks the entryway to the trendy venue with a storybook drawing on the wall. From the looks of the narrow alley, I would not have guessed the space to be so spacious with a full bar and dining room. Their fried chicken is one of the more popular items on the menu, but I don't usually find myself too impressed with $$-$$$ fried chicken.The complimentary skillet cornbread, $3 on the menu, was served in a cast-iron bread pan alongside some creamy butter. It was warm, a rather generous serving, and easily one of the best complimentary items I ever received from a restaurant.$8 Black-Eyed Pea Fritters - jalapeno, serrano, leeks, onions, carrots, herb aioli:These were plenty spicy. The herb aioli was tasty, but the fritters were packed with flavor already.In the past, I've also tried their steak sandwich and squid ink pasta with clams. The sandwich was tasty and filling, but the steak a little tough. The squid ink noodles were not bad, but it was sitting in some super salty broth. If I return, I'd try the pork chop or the Southern carbonara, since it is one of my favorite pasta dishes. Overall, I give it a 7/10 for decent food and a nice setting.
Love this southern comfort food in San Francisco. Very central location 2-3 blocks from union square in a little alley way. The restaurant has expanded and opened up a larger building right next door that has the full menu but only serves beer and wine.Great cocktails, beers on tap, and bottled beers for a Friday night. For food I would recommend the friend oysters (amazing sauce) and the mac and cheese (takes you back to those good old kraft days in elementary school) except this dish is literally 15x better.For main courses you can't go wrong with the fried chicken!The place gets pretty packed up I would highly recommend calling in to put your name on the list or make reservations ahead of time.
This place is situated in an alley type nook. If it wasn't for me my husband would've gotten lost (he's terrible with directions) I found it easily enough. We didn't have reservations so our little restaurant was on the side not the one all the way in the back. The place looked really nice and it even had a fireplace (it wasn't cold so there was no need for it to be on but I would've liked to see it on) it was clean and the staff was really nice. My husband ordered the fried chicken plate for himself and to share with our 1 year old. Both loved the chicken very much. I ordered the sea bass and it was sooooo good! The price was pretty high for the serving I received but I wasn't ravenous so I really did get full from what I ordered and enjoyed it so much. My husband and son were also really happy with their dinner. Also, I'd like to point out that my son can get loud and get frustrated at restaurants but nobody complained and their were two ladies (workers) that spoke with him and played a little while waiting for things to be done and he calmed down. I wish I could remember their names but to those two ladies. Thank you!
The first thing you'll notice about this place when you walk in is how loud it is. For some reason, everyone's voice just bounces off the wall and you probably won't be able to hear the person sitting across from you LOL legit came out of the restaurant with muffly ears.Aside from the loud atmosphere, the food here is not bad! My dad got the pork chop which was just pink enough where it's cooked except for this one part near the bone that was completely red. Just be careful when you're eating the pork! I got their burger which was very yummy and filling. I even added an egg for an extra dollar. The burger comes with ketchup and fries too! We shared the fried oyster appetizer that comes with a jalapeño aioli dip which we loved. All food comes with freshly baked cornbread too! And our waitress was super nice :) Had a great time here!
While touring San Francisco, we stopped in at Hops & Hominy for a couple beers during the happiest of hours. The bartender was super nice and friendly, and was happy to help us pick out a beer that most spoke to our hearts (as they do). Beer selection was really good, with some standards that are more common as well as some beers that are less so. Mostly local-brewery focused with a few interlopers, they have eight rotating taps to choose from.The food that wandered by on its way to other people's tables looked really good, but a glance at the menu didn't reveal anything that particularly spoke to us. This might have been because of the weather--it was super hot outside and thus sweltering inside. That's not really a time when you're looking to eat hot, filling Southern food. If I had to go back, though, that macaroni and cheese looked pretty off the hook.
Tucked away in a short street (Tillman Pl), the restaurant is casual with a robust list of brewskies and comfort foods at affordable prices. Our dishes were all tasty but the level of uniqueness/craving for more was varied. This is a 3.5/5 in my book.Black eyed pea fritters - As a heavier starter, try to pace yourself because this  spicy, deep fried goodness will lure you back for more.Lamb shank  - This wasn't quite what I was expecting. I thought this would be a large piece of meat but instead the meat was in "meatball" form on top a mix of roasted veggies. The dish was ok but I didn't come away from it with the typical fall-off of the bone/melt in your mouth tender meat sensation.  Seafood stew  - Rich creole-flavored broth with an assortment of seafood surprises. Save some of the complimentary corn bread to soak up the sauce. This dish screams for a side dish of grits or more grilled bread (a la mussels/frites style).Fried chicken & biscuit - A little underwhelming but this probably satisfies a craving for fried chicken for most. You get a good sized chicken breast and drumstick with a side of biscuit and a creamy veggie. I would've liked something a little lighter/brighter as a side dish to counter balance the deep fried chicken.
I was meeting up with a friend after a conference I went to at Moscone Center so I wanted to stay in the general area since I needed to take Bart back all the way to Pleasanton so I didn't want to go too far out of the way or drive/uber it somewhere. After some searching, I picked this place. My friend has never been either. He lives in Oakland and is usually quite busy so he's not in the City much unless he needs to be. It was definitely a place you'd miss if you weren't paying attention. It's down an ally way so blink and you'll miss it. Overall love the ambience. Nice bar plus someseating. I was able to make an open table res the same day hours before we went to dinner on a Tuesday at 7. Make a res. This place isn't huge so if you don't have one you could easy wait for a while. We were in the back corner but it was fine for us since we didn't feel like we weren't  bothering anyone or in anyone's way. I ended up with the fried chicken and my friend got mac and cheese and shrimp and grits. We both loved our selections. I personally don't like collared greens I was hoping I might like these but I should have really asked for a different side. The fried chicken however was great. Great crust nice seasoning. My friend felt that the shrimp and grits he got were the best he's had. Cornbread was served complementary. I did end up with some dessert and got the profiteroles and a cappuccino. Word to the wise, they have whole milk only. No non dairy options or different levels of fat. Overall great company great food. Will be back again. The brunch looks good!
This place is as sub par as it gets.We came here given the strong reviews we saw on Yelp.  Unfortunately, our experience didn't live up to it. The service was great. Our waitress was very smiley and helpful, but it wasn't until 10 minutes after we were seated that anyone paid any attention to us. I had to grab our hostess and her response was "oh, yes! A waitress. Let me get you one." Other than this, our service was great.But that was the highlight. The food was another story. We started with the black eyed peas fritters. At first site, they looked awesome. When biting in, we were greeted with a relatively bland filling. I couldn't really tell what the flavor was. The fact that is was fried made the dish palatable.The main course was just as underwhelming. I had the sea bass and my gf had the fried chicken. The fried chicken had almost no personality. I hate to say it, but KFC would have been a better option. The chicken itself was dry underneath the breaded coating, and the fried coating was bland. I'm no chef and hate to say it but, a little salt and pepper wouldn't hurt.The Sea bass was meh. I didn't finish it. It was cooked well and was a pretty good portion. Beyond this, not much to rave about.
This place was recommended to us. To make longer story short:We went here for dinner, however this is also a bar with sticky floors and noisy guests. Really really noisy guests. The food was also disappointing. I had chicken. It was really just chicken with something tasteless and lots of bone. Worst SF meal ever had.
FACT: The restaurant was named Hops & Hominy for the beer they serve (Hops) and the kernels they use in their grits (Hominy).Since my sis brought her dog, we sat outside, which was way better because it was just so noisy and warm indoors!  It was me, her, and a friend who came here on a Thursday night to catch up over dinner!We had:SKILLET CORNBREAD - ComplimentaryThis came out on a small iron skillet and served with orange blossom honey butter.  Presentation: great! Taste: meh. It tasted freaky dry no matter how much of that whipped butter I stabbed on.  The cornmeal in it really didn't help.  I didn't care for that extra grainy and gritty texture. Kind of glad I didn't pay for it.MAC & CHEESE - $9cast iron baked, sharp mornay, house-smoked bacon, breadcrumbs.Ah yes, now here's something yummy and beautiful that's server in an iron skillet! This was pretty decent--everything you can expect in a mac n cheese--thick creamy sauce, amazing texture from the breadcrumbs, and extra savory-ness and flavor from the bacon!  SHRIMP & GRITS - $22jumbo Gulf shrimp, house-cured tasso, stone ground grits, tomato brandy sauce, jalapeno.This...was okay.  I love grits and although the texture was fine, the flavors kind of threw me off. I think it was the tomato brandy that I mostly tasted--bitter and tangy, but maybe some people like that kind of kick.  It was mildly spicy and the shrimp was fine.  Overall just okay.FRIED CHICKEN - $21+$3 for 3rd pieceRocky Jr. free range chicken, creamed collard greens, buttermilk biscuit, pepper sauce.This dish comes with 2 pieces of yummy fried chicken, and wince there is 3 of us, we added one more for $3.  Not bad, right?  The chicken was moist even though it was mostly white meat.  The crispy skin was flavorful and not overly doughy not thick--it's how fried chicken should be!  I really enjoyed the tiny scoop of creamy collard greens because...it was creamy! So that made it less bitter in taste and not so salty from the pork in it.  The jackpot was fine--not the best I had but it was good enough!COCONUT PECAN PIE - $8Salted Caramel I've been fooled! This is no pie! It says pie but it's really a 4-layer cake with coconut frosting in between each thin layer.  It is topped with a salted caramel sauce, which u wish there was more of because the cake was just okay.  I say okay because I was expecting, and wanting pie. :P the candied pecan pieces and toasted coconut on the side was a nice touch...but darn it pie would have been nice...okay I'll stop :POverall this place is just okay.  Service was decent and the seating. Outdoors was nice, although chilly.  It's located in a nice quite alley though.  It's pretty pricy for the amount and quality of food.  I still enjoyed myself enough overall though.
Yum! This place is delicious!  Its a little hidden restaurant in an alley way. Busy, so make a reservation if you can! We we're very happy with our meal and can't wait to come back the only bad thing was the beer my husband got at the bar. The bartender only filled the glass 3/4 of the way. I attached a pic of it! Mussels appetizer: honestly the best mussels we've had in a while. The sauce was so good, I could have picked up the bowl to drink it and the shellfish was so fresh.Mac & cheese: creamy, savory, tangy wonderfulness Fried chicken: perfectly cooked and moist. Came with two pieces and Collard greens.Flat iron steak: cooked just like we ordered it.  Good seasoning and came with crispy potatoes

We shared the fried oyster appetizer that comes with a jalapeño aioli dip which we loved. All food comes with freshly baked cornbread too! And our waitress was super nice :) Had a great time here!
While touring San Francisco, we stopped in at Hops & Hominy for a couple beers during the happiest of hours. The bartender was super nice and friendly, and was happy to help us pick out a beer that most spoke to our hearts (as they do). Beer selection was really good, with some standards that are more common as well as some beers that are less so. Mostly local-brewery focused with a few interlopers, they have eight rotating taps to choose from.The food that wandered by on its way to other people's tables looked really good, but a glance at the menu didn't reveal anything that particularly spoke to us. This might have been because of the weather--it was super hot outside and thus sweltering inside. That's not really a time when you're looking to eat hot, filling Southern food. If I had to go back, though, that macaroni and cheese looked pretty off the hook.
Tucked away in a short street (Tillman Pl), the restaurant is casual with a robust list of brewskies and comfort foods at affordable prices. Our dishes were all tasty but the level of uniqueness/craving for more was varied. This is a 3.5/5 in my book.Black eyed pea fritters - As a heavier starter, try to pace yourself because this  spicy, deep fried goodness will lure you back for more.Lamb shank  - This wasn't quite what I was expecting. I thought this would be a large piece of meat but instead the meat was in "meatball" form on top a mix of roasted veggies. The dish was ok but I didn't come away from it with the typical fall-off of the bone/melt in your mouth tender meat sensation.  Seafood stew  - Rich creole-flavored broth with an assortment of seafood surprises. Save some of the complimentary corn bread to soak up the sauce. This dish screams for a side dish of grits or more grilled bread (a la mussels/frites style).Fried chicken & biscuit - A little underwhelming but this probably satisfies a craving for fried chicken for most. You get a good sized chicken breast and drumstick with a side of biscuit and a creamy veggie. I would've liked something a little lighter/brighter as a side dish to counter balance the deep fried chicken.
I was meeting up with a friend after a conference I went to at Moscone Center so I wanted to stay in the general area since I needed to take Bart back all the way to Pleasanton so I didn't want to go too far out of the way or drive/uber it somewhere. After some searching, I picked this place. My friend has never been either. He lives in Oakland and is usually quite busy so he's not in the City much unless he needs to be. It was definitely a place you'd miss if you weren't paying attention. It's down an ally way so blink and you'll miss it. Overall love the ambience. Nice bar plus someseating. I was able to make an open table res the same day hours before we went to dinner on a Tuesday at 7. Make a res. This place isn't huge so if you don't have one you could easy wait for a while. We were in the back corner but it was fine for us since we didn't feel like we weren't  bothering anyone or in anyone's way. I ended up with the fried chicken and my friend got mac and cheese and shrimp and grits. We both loved our selections. I personally don't like collared greens I was hoping I might like these but I should have really asked for a different side. The fried chicken however was great. Great crust nice seasoning. My friend felt that the shrimp and grits he got were the best he's had. Cornbread was served complementary. I did end up with some dessert and got the profiteroles and a cappuccino. Word to the wise, they have whole milk only. No non dairy options or different levels of fat. Overall great company great food. Will be back again. The brunch looks good!
This place is as sub par as it gets.We came here given the strong reviews we saw on Yelp.  Unfortunately, our experience didn't live up to it. The service was great. Our waitress was very smiley and helpful, but it wasn't until 10 minutes after we were seated that anyone paid any attention to us. I had to grab our hostess and her response was "oh, yes! A waitress. Let me get you one." Other than this, our service was great.But that was the highlight. The food was another story. We started with the black eyed peas fritters. At first site, they looked awesome. When biting in, we were greeted with a relatively bland filling. I couldn't really tell what the flavor was. The fact that is was fried made the dish palatable.The main course was just as underwhelming. I had the sea bass and my gf had the fried chicken. The fried chicken had almost no personality. I hate to say it, but KFC would have been a better option. The chicken itself was dry underneath the breaded coating, and the fried coating was bland. I'm no chef and hate to say it but, a little salt and pepper wouldn't hurt.The Sea bass was meh. I didn't finish it. It was cooked well and was a pretty good portion. Beyond this, not much to rave about.
This place was recommended to us. To make longer story short:We went here for dinner, however this is also a bar with sticky floors and noisy guests. Really really noisy guests. The food was also disappointing. I had chicken. It was really just chicken with something tasteless and lots of bone. Worst SF meal ever had.
FACT: The restaurant was named Hops & Hominy for the beer they serve (Hops) and the kernels they use in their grits (Hominy).Since my sis brought her dog, we sat outside, which was way better because it was just so noisy and warm indoors!  It was me, her, and a friend who came here on a Thursday night to catch up over dinner!We had:SKILLET CORNBREAD - ComplimentaryThis came out on a small iron skillet and served with orange blossom honey butter.  Presentation: great! Taste: meh. It tasted freaky dry no matter how much of that whipped butter I stabbed on.  The cornmeal in it really didn't help.  I didn't care for that extra grainy and gritty texture. Kind of glad I didn't pay for it.MAC & CHEESE - $9cast iron baked, sharp mornay, house-smoked bacon, breadcrumbs.Ah yes, now here's something yummy and beautiful that's server in an iron skillet! This was pretty decent--everything you can expect in a mac n cheese--thick creamy sauce, amazing texture from the breadcrumbs, and extra savory-ness and flavor from the bacon!  SHRIMP & GRITS - $22jumbo Gulf shrimp, house-cured tasso, stone ground grits, tomato brandy sauce, jalapeno.This...was okay.  I love grits and although the texture was fine, the flavors kind of threw me off. I think it was the tomato brandy that I mostly tasted--bitter and tangy, but maybe some people like that kind of kick.  It was mildly spicy and the shrimp was fine.  Overall just okay.FRIED CHICKEN - $21+$3 for 3rd pieceRocky Jr. free range chicken, creamed collard greens, buttermilk biscuit, pepper sauce.This dish comes with 2 pieces of yummy fried chicken, and wince there is 3 of us, we added one more for $3.  Not bad, right?  The chicken was moist even though it was mostly white meat.  The crispy skin was flavorful and not overly doughy not thick--it's how fried chicken should be!  I really enjoyed the tiny scoop of creamy collard greens because...it was creamy! So that made it less bitter in taste and not so salty from the pork in it.  The jackpot was fine--not the best I had but it was good enough!COCONUT PECAN PIE - $8Salted Caramel I've been fooled! This is no pie! It says pie but it's really a 4-layer cake with coconut frosting in between each thin layer.  It is topped with a salted caramel sauce, which u wish there was more of because the cake was just okay.  I say okay because I was expecting, and wanting pie. :P the candied pecan pieces and toasted coconut on the side was a nice touch...but darn it pie would have been nice...okay I'll stop :POverall this place is just okay.  Service was decent and the seating. Outdoors was nice, although chilly.  It's located in a nice quite alley though.  It's pretty pricy for the amount and quality of food.  I still enjoyed myself enough overall though.
Yum! This place is delicious!  Its a little hidden restaurant in an alley way. Busy, so make a reservation if you can! We we're very happy with our meal and can't wait to come back the only bad thing was the beer my husband got at the bar. The bartender only filled the glass 3/4 of the way. I attached a pic of it! Mussels appetizer: honestly the best mussels we've had in a while. The sauce was so good, I could have picked up the bowl to drink it and the shellfish was so fresh.Mac & cheese: creamy, savory, tangy wonderfulness Fried chicken: perfectly cooked and moist. Came with two pieces and Collard greens.Flat iron steak: cooked just like we ordered it.  Good seasoning and came with crispy potatoes
The short: decent burger in a very loud post-work atmosphereThis place is hidden in an alley and you'll likely to miss it if you're not looking for it. Head straight down and step right in! This place was crowded on a Tuesday night. My friend had arrived first and mentioned that the wait was over 1/2 hr! Then, she suggested the bar, which I was fine with because it was only the two of us.I browsed the menu and one of the few things I could afford was the Hops & Hominy burger. It was cooked to a wonderful medium rare (my preference) and the fries were great too. I thought that the raw onions on the side were a turn-off, and while the bartender gave us great service and my friend and I had the chance to chat about life, I wouldn't come here for just the burgers when there are better places around.The bathroom is unique. The wallpaper has women's faces that are covered in lipstick? And the washbasin is outside the toilet room.
I'm an out-of-towner generally on business but always eat and play somewhere unique to the areas I visit. I was staying at the Drake Hotel and used Yelp as always. Hops and Hominy reviews sounded pretty damn good. So here we go.The place is nicely setup and has a great vibe, dark but trendy and alive. Before you can get there, you must walk through an alley that is a standard big city type.  This place is much nicer in person and you should give it a go and here's why:Looking at the menu, which often changes, we decided on the Mac and Cheese for an app. We ordered the Fried Chicken and and the Crawfish Stew. Before your food arrives a fresh, hot mini iron skillet cornbread is brought to your table alongside a honey butter.The cornbread is a nice warmup biteThe Mac and Cheese featured an aldente rigata macaroni  pasta with a silky white cheese sauce.  A crispy cheese top with a bread crumb and bacon crumble gets toasted and that seals the deal.Fried Chicken is amazing. Crispy and tender thigh and drumstick served with some creamy collards. A biscuit near the chicken is a tasty bite as well.The Crawfish Stew was a different story. Although the broth was flavorful and tasty, the Crawfish and Prawn were way over cooked. The mussels and clams wre very good but again, the crawfish (the star) were so over cooked they were mushy. Thia was served with toast with cheese on top  which added a tomato soup and grilled cheese feel, which wasn't a bad thing. But overall, disappointed in that dish.As for service, the plaid laden staff were decent and did serve us someone else's order at first. I can tell you this though, the mussels dish on the looks amazing especially when it landed on my table mistakenly.  The waitress we had, a skinny, Caucasian girl, asked how everything was.  I told her about the overcooked Crawfish and prawn, and she seemed to not care and kind of gave me anything else look. Service just average in my opinion. Food is pretty much a can't missing the city and I would eat here again based on that alone.
Riesling was amazing! Cornbread was so so, but tasted amazing with the whipped butter! Sea bass was so so as well, just wasn't too flavorful and was relatively simple. I felt hungry afterwards still. BUTTT the mac and cheese was OMG, super delicious! You have to come here for the mac and cheese, and eat it while it's still hot!Ambient was nice, service was on point, and overall a good place for drinks and dinner.
Hops & hominy is southern food restaurant located in a cute little alleyway in San Francisco, totally walkable from Bart. I'm a huge fan of southern food so I was really excited to try this restaurant out. I highly recommend making a reservation during dinner hours because it does get busy.The waiters all wear plaid which I thought was super cute, to go with the southern theme. Service is great, they constantly ask you how you are doing and refill your water.They also start you off with a huge delicious freshly baked corn bread in a pan. The cornbread is super moist and buttery! (4/5)I ordered the hamachi crudo and shrimp & grits. Both were pretty amazing!Hamachi crudo (5/5)Their hamachi sashimi appetizer is nicely marinated with a bed of greens on top. They give you a pretty sizable portion and the fish is extremely fresh and tender. It was probably better than similar dishes served at sushi restaurants! Shrimp & grits (5/5)This was such a delicious dish! The grits were extremely creamy and cheesy, but not too overwhelmingly heavy. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce they use was incredible. I thought the plate was a bit small when it first arrived, but it is actually very filling. High recommend this! The food is a bit on the pricier side, but very good. Definitely will be back to try the fried chicken!
Great restaurant and vibe.  The menu is modern southern but doesn't alienate you if you're not into southern.  They also offer a few light Italian/California inspired dishes.  They've got a large selection of beers, wine, and cocktails at reasonable prices.  We had the shrimp and grits, hamachi crudo, and a gem Caesar salad.  The cornbread with butter cream was amazing!  Everything was delicious and the portions were fair.  I'd definitely be back.
Damn, I really wanted to hate this place since I work 50ft away, but bless their southern hearts, the food is really good!We've had the beef heart tartare, the fried chicken, the pork chop and the burgers and EVERYTHING has been spot on.  The fried chicken was flavorful without being over spiced.  The pork chop was perfectly pink on the inside and not overcooked at ALL and the tartare left me wanting more.Their corn bread is an amazing starter. Cocktails are well thought out and tasty.Prices are totally fair.   Downside: loud and busy.  Good for them.  However if you can get a table at the cafe or sit outside, you've got it made!!With so many restaurants in the area catering to tourists, I actually feel like I can get a decent meal without spending a fortune at H&H.
I amr here Saturday at 6:30 w 7ppl. We made a reservation.We shared a salad and ordered a main separately. I had a big lunch so I shared main w my female friend. Our main was lamb cheeks. 5 cheeks w warm veggies. Cheeks are so tender and tasty. Veggies and cream is gentle taste. I liked it. The price was $23 per person w/o drinks. Not expensive.The thing I like is the atmosphere and decoration, furniture of this place. So cool. I recommend for a small party or meet up.The server was nice enough to give as hot water and lemon.
Found this spot on Yelp And open table. Reviews were amazing so I thought I'd try it as I was staying nearby. Was disappointed that the online menu was not up to date and that the "southern carbonara" wasn't on the menu.  The complimentary corn bread was good and the butter melted on contact. Opted for the fried chicken, which was a small portion with just a breast and a leg. For a $3 up charge, you can get an extra piece of dark meat. The meat was juicy and tender. The skin was crunchy and well seasoned. House made hot sauce was a great addition. Came with a paltry side of collard greens. They were creamy and delicious, but incredibly sparse. Also a buttermilk biscuit but I Can't vouch for the taste since I didn't partake. A good number of draught beers, but many hoppy options (obviously) and a number of sours. For a fan of darker beers, there were only two draught a options, a tasty imperial stout and a spiced brown ale that tasted just like old fashioned root beer.Also, my food came out way to fast. I was looking for a relaxing sit down after a long day of traveling. Usually people complain about slow service, but I feel that hops and hominy wanted to turn tables quickly. I was seated shortly after 5pm and was settling the check and walking out about 25 minutes later.  Overall, decent food, but very pricey for what you get. I know San Francisco is expensive, but almost $40 for two pieces of fried chicken, a paltry side dish and one beer (including tip) is ridiculous. I might recommend Hops and Hominy to "hopheads" and beer snobs for happy hour maybe. But then again, I'm not sure if they have any happy hour specials.
This place was delicious. A little loud but an awesome vibe. The food was like glorified bar food. We got the mac and cheese, risotto, and the black eyed pea fritters. All were amazing. The free cornbread that was served att be beginning of the meal was also delicious. The drinks were amazing too. I had gotten a spicy jalapeño one as well as one with Sailor Jerrys in it (I don't remember the names) but both were delicious. I am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in San Fran
