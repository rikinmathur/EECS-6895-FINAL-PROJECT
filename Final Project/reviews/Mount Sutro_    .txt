Mt. Sutro has a Gorillas in the Mist/Fairyland feel to it. It's tall hillside forest of ivy-wrapped trees that beckons you to explore the second you breathe in the  intoxicating scent of Eucalyptus wafting in the moist air. The trails were a bit steep up and down and slick due to recent rain. Each bend had some new magical view, and has you half-hoping to discover some lost civilization. Beware of the long and prickly blackberry vines trying to claim back the trails and also poison oak. The hillside was ultra lush and uber green as in lucky charms green, with many different flowers in bloom from bleeding hearts to roses as well as a whole hillside of giant nasturtiums. We explored for a fair bit before high tailing it to the beach for sunset, but not without the promise to return and explore more trails to nowhere and somewhere.We loved the views of the city from between the trees and admired the lovely homes in the neighborhood! This is a splendid place that takes you away from the bustle of the city and is worth exploring.
This is a beautiful, dog-friendly place to hike which is little-known and therefore not crowded. The trails are lush and green, with towering trees, some over 200 years old. A hike to the top of this 909-ft mountain and back is just under 2 miles, and the trail snakes gently around the mountain so it's not too strenuous. There are some interesting rock formations on the trail, and you can even catch a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge. Treasure these views because unfortunately there isn't much of a view from the peak, (unlike at Mount Davidson). However, it's still a beautiful hike and definitely worth checking out. We did not have any problems with poison oak despite the signs. We parked for free on Clarendon Ave at about Johnstone Drive, and walked into the Aldea San Miguel (UCSF) housing on Johnstone Drive, then walked up the first small hill and took the Fairy Gates Trail to the right. There are Porta Potties and a hand wash station at this entrance. After 1/3 a mile, we took the Historic Trail to the left. You will soon have to cross a UCSF road, with a road barrier on the side. The trail continues directly across the road. I did not see any cars on the road during my hike, but still be careful crossing. The Historic Trail snakes around the mountain, and at one mile, take the South Ridge trail to your left, which will take you on a briefly paved trail, and then leads you to the summit. From here I took the North Ridge Trail back down, and once again crossed the road to the Fairy Gates Trail, which led me back to where I started and cuts off about 0.2 miles. You can also head back the way you came. There are a few other trails in the Open Space to explore, and if you are looking for a longer hike, you can start at the Stanyan Trailhead (off of Stanyan St. near 17th St.).Unfortunately UCSF is in the process of cutting down thousands of trees on 25 acres. In 2014 they cut down over 200 trees! You can find an online petition to sign to Save Sutro Forest.
Great for a quick hike! We started off with the Historic Trail and took the Fairy Gates Trail afterwards. It took a little less than an hour. It's a very surreal location since the city is almost entirely covered by the tall trees and greenery of this place.I read a Yelp review that said this would be a hard to navigate place, but I think as long as you stick to the trails, you should be fine and will stumble upon a sign eventually, directing you to which trail is which way.Anyways, if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city without leaving it, this place is the one. But if you're looking for striking views of the city, I'd go elsewhere (Twin Peaks, Bernal Heights Hill -- to name a few).
What a lovely place and so close to the city. Took me all of half an hour (I live in the center of the city) to reach this marvelous hiking track tucked away right in the middle of a suburban looking area.Me along with a group of girls decided to spend our Sunday morning hiking through Mount Sutro and now I wish I could spend every Sunday like that, instead of sitting at a cafe drinking sugar laden coffee. The track is perfect for first timers like me. Not too tough, not too easy, just the right amount to make you feel accomplished at the end of it. There are maps at points so that you don't lose yourself. The trees are lush green! Everyone who walks their dogs, runs or cycles the path are very courteous and accommodating.At the base of the mount are cafe where post hike you kick off those shoes and enjoy your cuppa Joe. A little walk down and you can sleep under a tree at Golden Gate park. Well, that's what I did. After eating a lot. Guess I'll burn that in my next hike ;) ;)
I think this place looks wonderful but in actual life...uhhh if you don't know what you are doing, please don't come here. I came here thinking it would be a wonderful place for a tourist to hike but nope. just nope. Following a map, i entered from Stanyan st and it was like a horror film waiting to happen. my group went up hoping to reach the deck or something. The day we went was a foggy morning and not many people were in sight so we were on high alert. We struggled for about half an hour to get up but we somehow always end up back down to where we started.  BTW we saw a lot of danger signs, from poison oaks to do not enter signs and chains. yes . its a keep away sign for me.Maybe if you are a local and you know what you are doing then yes i think i would recommend. If you are a tourist with no idea why you are here, please don't come, you will end up with a lot of trouble on your hands.
I've had Mount Sutro bookmarked for quite some time but finally made it there yesterday for some urban hiking. Having taken Muni to the Castro station, it was about a 1 mile walk up 17th Street to the entrance on Stanyan. Turn left on Stanyan and you will see the short set of wooden stairs to enter. Once on the trail, the noise and bustle of the city faded away. There was the whisper of the trees and the chirps of the birds, as I felt far away from the city.Everything was blanketed in green and while it was not muddy on the day I ventured in, I can imagine the trails getting slippery if there is any rain at all. The fog was rolling in and the forest took on a magical quality. Trails seemed well maintained and were easy to follow with sign posts at regular intervals. I took the Historic trail up from Stanyan to the Northridge and up to the Summit. The summit itself has an open meadow but none of the sweeping views of the other hills in the city you might come to expect. That's okay-the Sutro forest is more about the journey than the destination. Coming down, I took the Eastridge trail, to the Mystery trail, then somehow connected with the same path I took up to get back to Stanyan. On the way down I took a short detour on the Fairy Gates trail-it featured some unique rock formations and ended at a residential area. It was worth a short out and back walk from the main trail.Easy paths but narrow in some areas. The only time it's an issue is when you encounter a mountain biker. They sometimes come down fast and there's not a lot of room to move over for them. Although, overall, everyone was friendly, cautious and respectful of each other on the trails.All in all, this is a wonderous little forest right in the middle of the city and worth a trip if you want to enjoy a short, peaceful hike. If you're up for additional urban hiking, you can easily combine it with a trek up to Corona Heights park and the Randall Museum, which is what I ended up doing. Or, if you're super ambitious, you can also find your way up to Twin Peaks. Loved every second and every path I ventured on in the Sutro Forest.
Nice way to spend a Sunday morning with a new friend. Fantastic views of the city surrounded by the freshness of trees and the flowers. It is not an easy place to go for hiking, mostly just to go for the view and see the nice houses that have that privilege. It is like a hidden forest in the middle of town, seriously. Very pretty and unexpected (we were looking forward checking out another place and ended up there). Worth the parking hassle.
If you are looking for a quick hike in the city, the Mount Sutro paths are a good start. With fairly accessible street parking around the multiple entrances to this place, it is easy to get to and easy to hike. We parked on Edgewood avenue and walked straight up to the Edgewood trail. After that we wrapped around and followed the historic trail all the way down until it connected with the south ridge trail which we took up to the summit. After that we took the north ridge trail back down to where we came in.The entire area has a sort of enchanted forest type feel to it. The fog, the high canopy, the damp ground and lush vegetation throughout makes this hike a wonderful experience. It is a bit short to get a good sweat up but it is enjoyable nonetheless.
Mount Sutro is definitely a hidden gem. I felt like hiking one day but didn't want to travel far for a good trail so I asked my significant other to look for a place on Yelp. Mount Sutro seemed to fit our criteria so we decided to give it a try. This place is amazing! It's like a hidden forest in the middle of the city. It's very peaceful and not too crowded you almost forget you're in the middle of SF. We decided to try the historic trail since it seemed pretty low key which is what we wanted. I would definitely return and explore other trails/paths.
Truly a hidden gem amidst the hectic city! I came here twice both times with SF natives and both were amazed and surprised at the fact that this place exists. Great place to take a hike. Short yet somewhat steep trail, perfect for beginners. There's not much to see at the peak though. But just go and enjoy the nature! Enter from 17th and Stanyan. Parking is usually not an issue.
Such a magical gem, hidden away in the heart of SF. Seeing the tall eucalyptus trees hugged by ivy and colorful flowers on the trail just makes all your troubles melt away. The fog that gently rests upon the canopy makes you feel like you're in a fairy tale. I found this link to be very helpful in terms of parking, what to expect, and how to be prepared. It's worth a read before you go. But if you want to wing it, you will still have a great time :) There are so many trails! mntsutro.com/hikingIt's usually easy to find parking near 17th and Stanyan. The trailhead there is just an inconspicuous wooden staircase between two residential houses! Within a few steps, you are immediately transferred to a quiet, serene natural world without the sounds of the city. It's pretty amazing how quick the transition is. As you hike on, you can see a view in the distance, but you don't really see or hear any streets or cars, which makes it very calming and close to nature. This experience is so unique to SF; just 15 minutes outside of downtown, you can step inside this forest and immediately forget that you're in the heart of one of the busiest cities in America!
Beautiful, hidden hiking spot behind UCSF! Who would have known? I was so impressed by the gorgeous foliage and greenery on a sunny day. Trails are nicely paved, though I wish the signs were a little bigger! Take some time to rejuvenate and genuinely enjoy nature out here.
The directions people listed in these reviews were such a huge help! Loved all the greenery on a beautiful day.
Who knew there was a forest here in the city! Such a nice nature area hidden away. Listened to some other reviews that advised us to take the wooden stairs entrance on 17th and Stanyan. Didn't have to pay for parking, just parked on the curb of houses nearby. We went on a super windy day so the trees looked like they were gonna topple over any second. Branches were constantly falling off the trees and sometimes hit us (bulls eye!). We attempted to search for the Fairy Gates trail but it started to get dark so we turned around. I'd like to come back again and explore more.Overall, beautiful scenery. I'm sure it looks prettier on a sunny day or even a foggy one. But nonetheless, managed to get some cool photos and had a great experience. Generally easy hike. General rule: never touch any plants! Poison oak is in the area so be watchful.
Beautiful, misty little trek in the middle of the city. I had no idea it was there. Lots of very, very tall [eucalyptus?] trees, so I recommend making your way to neighboring Tank Hill for a view of nearly the entire Bay (Point Bonita/Golden Gate to Hunter's Point). Worth exploring!
This is a gorgeous spot for a quick hike. The trail itself is pretty short, but it's uphill and reasonably vigorous. The views from the top are beautiful.
A (hopefully) quiet and tranquil way to spend a Sunday morning, which is what we were looking for. What we got were loud children running around, mountain bikers on a walking trail, extremely loud hipster-yuppies talking about their house remodel and a loud cell phone talker. Look, you're out in nature, surrounded by trees....can you appreciate that and just be fucking silent? Just BE present and enjoy the lovely tree canopy over your head. Or, if you must talk, do so in hushed tones. If you want to carry on an extremely loud conversation, do so elsewhere in San Francisco. Thank you. /end rant.To me, it feels like I'm not even in the city when we come here. 80 acres with trees around 100 years old? Sign me up. See, I live in NYC, surrounded by buildings and constant noise and sometimes I like to escape to Central Park or Prospect Park. When I come to San Francisco, yes, I like to travel to Muir Woods, but, I also like that I can walk up the street (we entered on Stanyan St. and exited on Edgewood Ave.), up some stairs near someone's house and then I'm in nature. While leisurely walking on the trail I kept stopping to listen to the creaking trees and try to spot various chirping/squawking birds--apparently there are 40+ species of birds that frequent the woods (where's an ornithologist, when you need one?). We weren't here for long...but I'd really like to go back soon. It's quite an easy trail too. Enjoy the silence, people.*Five stars for the woods, 2-3 for the people who were there when we were.
A hidden forest in the middle of the city.My wife and I love taking hikes or trail hiking to be exact. We both decided to pull a "sick day" and take a lovely Monday off and explore the city. Looking up places to hike after deciding to keep it local I stumbled upon this location. Parking can be tricky especially if you don't know where to enter as there really isn't a formal entrance. I'd suggest the entrance are on Stanyan and 17th. This is where those stairs are located in a lot of the pictures. As soon as you pass through the houses you get sucked into a wilderness. You almost forget you are in the middle of the city. The trees just tower over you stretching 100ft up. The trails are very well maintained as well as we didn't have any problem sharing the trail with other people or even the occasional person on a bicycle. We only explored part of the Historical trail and didn't even complete it due to the parking time restrictions being that it's a neighborhood we parked in and it's a 2hr parking limit. There's plenty of other parking areas and other unmarked entrances around the perimeter of Mount Sutro. The only hints you catch of the city is when you see the neighborhoods surround the area. Great views can be seen for sure. We didn't make it up to the summit but I'm sure it's glorious once up there.For sure we will be back to explore more of this place.
Amazing place to be at in the mornings. You are literally walking through the clouds at the summit. Its a easy hike except for a bit on the west trail.
Wanted to hike somewhere with my son and decided to hike up Mt Sutro..thanks to yelpers .  As advised we drove to Stanyan and lucky for us, we found parking on 17th.  Then we searched for the brown painted staircase.  Apparently it's very discreet and it's just slightly left in front of 17th, with a sign to be very quiet as it is a residential neighborhood and it's tucked in between two housesAs we went up the stairs, we soon found ourselves in a very green and tall forest.  Just loved the easy hike up. Be careful as the paths can be narrow.  Best to walk one by one.  Also, it can be muddy and slippery, so avoid hiking when it's been raining. Seems we were on the Historic trail. The signs are confusing but just go up and you can't go wrong.  You will be walking on a ledge, so no horse playing and focus on your path.Definitely will go back again and will bring visitors to visit this beautiful secret forest.  There's been talk about chopping these trees down, so enjoy them while it's still here.

We explored for a fair bit before high tailing it to the beach for sunset, but not without the promise to return and explore more trails to nowhere and somewhere.We loved the views of the city from between the trees and admired the lovely homes in the neighborhood! This is a splendid place that takes you away from the bustle of the city and is worth exploring.
This is a beautiful, dog-friendly place to hike which is little-known and therefore not crowded. The trails are lush and green, with towering trees, some over 200 years old. A hike to the top of this 909-ft mountain and back is just under 2 miles, and the trail snakes gently around the mountain so it's not too strenuous. There are some interesting rock formations on the trail, and you can even catch a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge. Treasure these views because unfortunately there isn't much of a view from the peak, (unlike at Mount Davidson). However, it's still a beautiful hike and definitely worth checking out. We did not have any problems with poison oak despite the signs. We parked for free on Clarendon Ave at about Johnstone Drive, and walked into the Aldea San Miguel (UCSF) housing on Johnstone Drive, then walked up the first small hill and took the Fairy Gates Trail to the right. There are Porta Potties and a hand wash station at this entrance. After 1/3 a mile, we took the Historic Trail to the left. You will soon have to cross a UCSF road, with a road barrier on the side. The trail continues directly across the road. I did not see any cars on the road during my hike, but still be careful crossing. The Historic Trail snakes around the mountain, and at one mile, take the South Ridge trail to your left, which will take you on a briefly paved trail, and then leads you to the summit. From here I took the North Ridge Trail back down, and once again crossed the road to the Fairy Gates Trail, which led me back to where I started and cuts off about 0.2 miles. You can also head back the way you came. There are a few other trails in the Open Space to explore, and if you are looking for a longer hike, you can start at the Stanyan Trailhead (off of Stanyan St. near 17th St.).Unfortunately UCSF is in the process of cutting down thousands of trees on 25 acres. In 2014 they cut down over 200 trees! You can find an online petition to sign to Save Sutro Forest.
Great for a quick hike! We started off with the Historic Trail and took the Fairy Gates Trail afterwards. It took a little less than an hour. It's a very surreal location since the city is almost entirely covered by the tall trees and greenery of this place.I read a Yelp review that said this would be a hard to navigate place, but I think as long as you stick to the trails, you should be fine and will stumble upon a sign eventually, directing you to which trail is which way.Anyways, if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city without leaving it, this place is the one. But if you're looking for striking views of the city, I'd go elsewhere (Twin Peaks, Bernal Heights Hill -- to name a few).
What a lovely place and so close to the city. Took me all of half an hour (I live in the center of the city) to reach this marvelous hiking track tucked away right in the middle of a suburban looking area.Me along with a group of girls decided to spend our Sunday morning hiking through Mount Sutro and now I wish I could spend every Sunday like that, instead of sitting at a cafe drinking sugar laden coffee. The track is perfect for first timers like me. Not too tough, not too easy, just the right amount to make you feel accomplished at the end of it. There are maps at points so that you don't lose yourself. The trees are lush green! Everyone who walks their dogs, runs or cycles the path are very courteous and accommodating.At the base of the mount are cafe where post hike you kick off those shoes and enjoy your cuppa Joe. A little walk down and you can sleep under a tree at Golden Gate park. Well, that's what I did. After eating a lot. Guess I'll burn that in my next hike ;) ;)
I think this place looks wonderful but in actual life...uhhh if you don't know what you are doing, please don't come here. I came here thinking it would be a wonderful place for a tourist to hike but nope. just nope. Following a map, i entered from Stanyan st and it was like a horror film waiting to happen. my group went up hoping to reach the deck or something. The day we went was a foggy morning and not many people were in sight so we were on high alert. We struggled for about half an hour to get up but we somehow always end up back down to where we started.  BTW we saw a lot of danger signs, from poison oaks to do not enter signs and chains. yes . its a keep away sign for me.Maybe if you are a local and you know what you are doing then yes i think i would recommend. If you are a tourist with no idea why you are here, please don't come, you will end up with a lot of trouble on your hands.
I've had Mount Sutro bookmarked for quite some time but finally made it there yesterday for some urban hiking. Having taken Muni to the Castro station, it was about a 1 mile walk up 17th Street to the entrance on Stanyan. Turn left on Stanyan and you will see the short set of wooden stairs to enter. Once on the trail, the noise and bustle of the city faded away. There was the whisper of the trees and the chirps of the birds, as I felt far away from the city.Everything was blanketed in green and while it was not muddy on the day I ventured in, I can imagine the trails getting slippery if there is any rain at all. The fog was rolling in and the forest took on a magical quality. Trails seemed well maintained and were easy to follow with sign posts at regular intervals. I took the Historic trail up from Stanyan to the Northridge and up to the Summit. The summit itself has an open meadow but none of the sweeping views of the other hills in the city you might come to expect. That's okay-the Sutro forest is more about the journey than the destination. Coming down, I took the Eastridge trail, to the Mystery trail, then somehow connected with the same path I took up to get back to Stanyan. On the way down I took a short detour on the Fairy Gates trail-it featured some unique rock formations and ended at a residential area. It was worth a short out and back walk from the main trail.Easy paths but narrow in some areas. The only time it's an issue is when you encounter a mountain biker. They sometimes come down fast and there's not a lot of room to move over for them. Although, overall, everyone was friendly, cautious and respectful of each other on the trails.All in all, this is a wonderous little forest right in the middle of the city and worth a trip if you want to enjoy a short, peaceful hike. If you're up for additional urban hiking, you can easily combine it with a trek up to Corona Heights park and the Randall Museum, which is what I ended up doing. Or, if you're super ambitious, you can also find your way up to Twin Peaks. Loved every second and every path I ventured on in the Sutro Forest.
Nice way to spend a Sunday morning with a new friend. Fantastic views of the city surrounded by the freshness of trees and the flowers. It is not an easy place to go for hiking, mostly just to go for the view and see the nice houses that have that privilege. It is like a hidden forest in the middle of town, seriously. Very pretty and unexpected (we were looking forward checking out another place and ended up there). Worth the parking hassle.
If you are looking for a quick hike in the city, the Mount Sutro paths are a good start. With fairly accessible street parking around the multiple entrances to this place, it is easy to get to and easy to hike. We parked on Edgewood avenue and walked straight up to the Edgewood trail. After that we wrapped around and followed the historic trail all the way down until it connected with the south ridge trail which we took up to the summit. After that we took the north ridge trail back down to where we came in.The entire area has a sort of enchanted forest type feel to it. The fog, the high canopy, the damp ground and lush vegetation throughout makes this hike a wonderful experience. It is a bit short to get a good sweat up but it is enjoyable nonetheless.
Mount Sutro is definitely a hidden gem. I felt like hiking one day but didn't want to travel far for a good trail so I asked my significant other to look for a place on Yelp. Mount Sutro seemed to fit our criteria so we decided to give it a try. This place is amazing! It's like a hidden forest in the middle of the city. It's very peaceful and not too crowded you almost forget you're in the middle of SF. We decided to try the historic trail since it seemed pretty low key which is what we wanted. I would definitely return and explore other trails/paths.
Truly a hidden gem amidst the hectic city! I came here twice both times with SF natives and both were amazed and surprised at the fact that this place exists. Great place to take a hike. Short yet somewhat steep trail, perfect for beginners. There's not much to see at the peak though. But just go and enjoy the nature! Enter from 17th and Stanyan. Parking is usually not an issue.
Such a magical gem, hidden away in the heart of SF. Seeing the tall eucalyptus trees hugged by ivy and colorful flowers on the trail just makes all your troubles melt away. The fog that gently rests upon the canopy makes you feel like you're in a fairy tale. I found this link to be very helpful in terms of parking, what to expect, and how to be prepared. It's worth a read before you go. But if you want to wing it, you will still have a great time :) There are so many trails! mntsutro.com/hikingIt's usually easy to find parking near 17th and Stanyan. The trailhead there is just an inconspicuous wooden staircase between two residential houses! Within a few steps, you are immediately transferred to a quiet, serene natural world without the sounds of the city. It's pretty amazing how quick the transition is. As you hike on, you can see a view in the distance, but you don't really see or hear any streets or cars, which makes it very calming and close to nature. This experience is so unique to SF; just 15 minutes outside of downtown, you can step inside this forest and immediately forget that you're in the heart of one of the busiest cities in America!
Beautiful, hidden hiking spot behind UCSF! Who would have known? I was so impressed by the gorgeous foliage and greenery on a sunny day. Trails are nicely paved, though I wish the signs were a little bigger! Take some time to rejuvenate and genuinely enjoy nature out here.
The directions people listed in these reviews were such a huge help! Loved all the greenery on a beautiful day.
Who knew there was a forest here in the city! Such a nice nature area hidden away. Listened to some other reviews that advised us to take the wooden stairs entrance on 17th and Stanyan. Didn't have to pay for parking, just parked on the curb of houses nearby. We went on a super windy day so the trees looked like they were gonna topple over any second. Branches were constantly falling off the trees and sometimes hit us (bulls eye!). We attempted to search for the Fairy Gates trail but it started to get dark so we turned around. I'd like to come back again and explore more.Overall, beautiful scenery. I'm sure it looks prettier on a sunny day or even a foggy one. But nonetheless, managed to get some cool photos and had a great experience. Generally easy hike. General rule: never touch any plants! Poison oak is in the area so be watchful.
Beautiful, misty little trek in the middle of the city. I had no idea it was there. Lots of very, very tall [eucalyptus?] trees, so I recommend making your way to neighboring Tank Hill for a view of nearly the entire Bay (Point Bonita/Golden Gate to Hunter's Point). Worth exploring!
This is a gorgeous spot for a quick hike. The trail itself is pretty short, but it's uphill and reasonably vigorous. The views from the top are beautiful.
A (hopefully) quiet and tranquil way to spend a Sunday morning, which is what we were looking for. What we got were loud children running around, mountain bikers on a walking trail, extremely loud hipster-yuppies talking about their house remodel and a loud cell phone talker. Look, you're out in nature, surrounded by trees....can you appreciate that and just be fucking silent? Just BE present and enjoy the lovely tree canopy over your head. Or, if you must talk, do so in hushed tones. If you want to carry on an extremely loud conversation, do so elsewhere in San Francisco. Thank you. /end rant.To me, it feels like I'm not even in the city when we come here. 80 acres with trees around 100 years old? Sign me up. See, I live in NYC, surrounded by buildings and constant noise and sometimes I like to escape to Central Park or Prospect Park. When I come to San Francisco, yes, I like to travel to Muir Woods, but, I also like that I can walk up the street (we entered on Stanyan St. and exited on Edgewood Ave.), up some stairs near someone's house and then I'm in nature. While leisurely walking on the trail I kept stopping to listen to the creaking trees and try to spot various chirping/squawking birds--apparently there are 40+ species of birds that frequent the woods (where's an ornithologist, when you need one?). We weren't here for long...but I'd really like to go back soon. It's quite an easy trail too. Enjoy the silence, people.*Five stars for the woods, 2-3 for the people who were there when we were.
A hidden forest in the middle of the city.My wife and I love taking hikes or trail hiking to be exact. We both decided to pull a "sick day" and take a lovely Monday off and explore the city. Looking up places to hike after deciding to keep it local I stumbled upon this location. Parking can be tricky especially if you don't know where to enter as there really isn't a formal entrance. I'd suggest the entrance are on Stanyan and 17th. This is where those stairs are located in a lot of the pictures. As soon as you pass through the houses you get sucked into a wilderness. You almost forget you are in the middle of the city. The trees just tower over you stretching 100ft up. The trails are very well maintained as well as we didn't have any problem sharing the trail with other people or even the occasional person on a bicycle. We only explored part of the Historical trail and didn't even complete it due to the parking time restrictions being that it's a neighborhood we parked in and it's a 2hr parking limit. There's plenty of other parking areas and other unmarked entrances around the perimeter of Mount Sutro. The only hints you catch of the city is when you see the neighborhoods surround the area. Great views can be seen for sure. We didn't make it up to the summit but I'm sure it's glorious once up there.For sure we will be back to explore more of this place.
Amazing place to be at in the mornings. You are literally walking through the clouds at the summit. Its a easy hike except for a bit on the west trail.
Wanted to hike somewhere with my son and decided to hike up Mt Sutro..thanks to yelpers .  As advised we drove to Stanyan and lucky for us, we found parking on 17th.  Then we searched for the brown painted staircase.  Apparently it's very discreet and it's just slightly left in front of 17th, with a sign to be very quiet as it is a residential neighborhood and it's tucked in between two housesAs we went up the stairs, we soon found ourselves in a very green and tall forest.  Just loved the easy hike up. Be careful as the paths can be narrow.  Best to walk one by one.  Also, it can be muddy and slippery, so avoid hiking when it's been raining. Seems we were on the Historic trail. The signs are confusing but just go up and you can't go wrong.  You will be walking on a ledge, so no horse playing and focus on your path.Definitely will go back again and will bring visitors to visit this beautiful secret forest.  There's been talk about chopping these trees down, so enjoy them while it's still here.
Mt. Sutro has a Gorillas in the Mist/Fairyland feel to it. It's tall hillside forest of ivy-wrapped trees that beckons you to explore the second you breathe in the  intoxicating scent of Eucalyptus wafting in the moist air. The trails were a bit steep up and down and slick due to recent rain. Each bend had some new magical view, and has you half-hoping to discover some lost civilization. Beware of the long and prickly blackberry vines trying to claim back the trails and also poison oak. The hillside was ultra lush and uber green as in lucky charms green, with many different flowers in bloom from bleeding hearts to roses as well as a whole hillside of giant nasturtiums. We explored for a fair bit before high tailing it to the beach for sunset, but not without the promise to return and explore more trails to nowhere and somewhere.We loved the views of the city from between the trees and admired the lovely homes in the neighborhood!
