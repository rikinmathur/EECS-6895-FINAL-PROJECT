Holly Park: Curvy, Compact and Fabulous. Much like myself - ha-haaaa (Jackee style).No, but seriously, Holly Park is a great place to spend a Saturday reading, enjoying a picnic and people/dog watching. Especially if Dolores Park is a madhouse and it makes you feel a little old because you don't: smoke weed, have a waxed mustache or you aren't currently attending an artisanal circus school. Holly Park is just neighborhood people chilling in a park.Great views and great breezes off the Bay. Oh, and there is almost always parking.
Great park for people with kids and dogs, or anyone that enjoys a killer view. It has nice local neighborhood vibe, and you will encounter at least one person walking their dog. Play structure for kids is pretty modern and updated. Views are amazing. Nice oasis on top of bernal heights. Only thing to note is: it's a bit of a steep walk (which I like but others may not),and like most of SF, it's pretty cold and foggy-wear layers!
Looking for balance?  Live in the city? You just found it.  Holly Park is an oasis, a "God's country" if you will, a magical place that takes the hustle and bustle of urban noises and soothes them as you take a stroll along its paved path.  The eucalyptus trees at the very top is truly breathtaking.  It's like strolling through "The Wizard of Oz."Since its renovation in September of 2004, Holly Park provides state of the art kiddie playground, a deck with tables and benches that can accommodate a crowd of about 50 including barbecue grills to boot.  A tennis and basketball court, and just on the other side, is an awesome baseball field.  This is a dog friendly park with well behaved dogs including their owners! I have taken my dogs here many times and it has got to be one of the my favorite parks in San Francisco.  There are plenty of shades, tons of green grass for the dogs to run around and explore, a clean drinking water fountain both for humans and their dogs, a well lit and clean bathrooms, and benches everywhere to sit and chill.  The park is clean.  What more can you ask for?
Truly enjoy this cute round about circled park . Great for walking or jogging laps around with great panaramic views of san francisco .
Love the view and its definitely worth the uphill hike. Did the loop a few times with my dog. I took off 1 star for many dog walkers who like to walk a pack( 5-11 dogs) all without a leash. It just freaks me and my small dog out.
If I reviewed each and every park in San Francisco, Holly Park would be at the top of my list. Why? Sentimental memories of being a kid in the park on monkey bars, swings, being a little dare devil jumping off the things....perfect landing!!! I was a playground gymnast. Going to the park as a kid always made me happy. As an adult, I still enjoy coming to this park. It's nice to see that this park is still very well maintained, nice baseball diamond, playground, picnic tables, tennis and basketball courts. It's a tiny park, but well taken care of. Brings back great memories. The trees are so very tall and serve as a protective canopy over the park. The light breaks between the trees and from the top you have an excellent view of the bay view. I walk through this park often, just to hear the Eucalyptus trees. I could always walk around the circle, but prefer walking right through Holly Park every time. I like to run around Holly Park. It's a perfect little circle and not very long at all (probably 1/4 mile around). It's easy to brag about how many laps you did. Lol. I hope you get a chance to enjoy this park for yourself. ;)
Nothing worth venturing out to, but if you're in the area - stop by for a doggy potty break.
Great place to come and relax on such a hot day like this bring your friends some drinks food and have a party
I enjoy this park, particularly its view when you are looking to the east of the bay and Bayview. The park itself is a little hill, its got a baseball diamond and basketball and tennis courts, and a little strip of playground equipment (fenced in) for the little ones. It's definitely dog friendly like the rest of Bernal Heights, and I often see dogs there off leash. It's well maintained, has a public bathroom, and has nice big trees.All that said, it's pretty tiny, not at all big enough to get lost or even take a decent length walk. It's a nice place to sit and have a picnic lunch, and I always walk through it instead of around it on my way to Cortland Ave, but that's about it.
Definitely my new favorite park for people and dogs alike. It's always quiet with the birds singing and tons of trees and grass where some humans run and various dogs play. It's a little further from me than my second favorite park -billy goat hill- but for the sunshine and all the rest, it's worth it. Most dogs here are on the small to medium size so we all feel pretty comfortable with our dogs off leash.
Not overrated like Golden Gate Park nor is it a dump like other parks. This is the essential hill top park for strolls, dogs, kids, BBQs & picnics. In an area where improvement is much needed & not a threat to citizens.
This is an awesome little park. I love to bring my 10 month old baby here to get some fresh air. Park is in a quiet area with parking. There is a pathway where you can walk or jog with a slight hill. It has amazing views. I usually push my daughter in the strollers around the park a few times then take her to the kids playground. Dog friendly. It has a basketball court and tennis court. Down the block there's a few blocks if store where you can eat or grab coffee. Great hidden park.
Charming little park! My pug and I walk around the park twice and then head home. It's on a hill, so there's a little hike. Always cute kiddos hanging around and other dog owners. It's always very clean and well kept. Love this park!
Great park with a kids playground, a ballpark, nice courts, and some of the best views in the city.
Great place for urban camping in your car. Great views in the morning. Clean public bathrooms.
I came here for the first time last weekend. It's a rounded hill elevated from the surrounding streets, and pleasantly breezy with the hilltop forest of tall trees. The courts (basketball, tennis) were empty when we came. It seemed fairly large for a neighbourhood park, and surprisingly Clean -- even the restroom looked very  civilized.One caveat, you need to keep your bearings. The park was perfectly oval, and streets on opposite sides (Highland Ave, Park St) have the exact same names. We hopped on Highland Ave meaning to go east and ended up on the wrong side of the freeway (and not the nice part of town). So stay on the east side of this park.Going north, Elsie St makes for a scenic walk with unstoppable views to the west.
A nice dog friendly park.  There's a good baseball field with fences all the way around the playing area.  The park is usually always windy due to being on top of the hill.
Dog-friendly.Nice views of the city.
Great Park!  I have been coming here for years....since I live right across the street!  Most people and dogs are friendly.  Around 4/5pm it can get pretty windy but other than that it's a clean, Beautiful park.
The playground at this park is heaven!  It's fenced in and super nice.The equipment is modern and in really good shape.  The ground is cushy, so it doesn't hurt as much when the kids wipe out (as they inevitably do).They've got all the basics (swings, play structures to climb) and some extra cool play structures (one that reminds me of a web that Spiderman would create).
