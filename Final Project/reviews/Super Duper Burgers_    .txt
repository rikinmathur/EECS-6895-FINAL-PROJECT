Burger game changer. All my coworkers have been telling me to try Super Duper because I've NEVER EVER tried it. We have literally been talking about this for a few months now lol. So today after a hard ass workout at Cardio Tone I bit the bullet and decided to stop by with two of my said coworkers for a bite. We got there at around 6:15pm on a Friday. We got lucky and beat the stream of people who came in after us. We also got the last big table. It smells so freaking good when you walk in. I was told to get a mini burger with cheese. I obliged and also added grilled onions because a burger always needs grilled onions. We shared an order of garlic fries as well. Seating-a lot of two people tables! See if you can push them together if you're 3+. We actually sat upstairs where they had a long wooden table that can accommodate a party of 6 ish. It's a nice area that overlooks the entire restaurant. There are munchkin tables outside. Some tall tables downstairs. Mini cheese burger-DELICIOUS. I think super duper knocks out In N Out... The pattie was so juicy and tender and perfectly cooked. It was a very good medium well. Just the tiniest amount of pink. It was perf! The cheddar was melted beautiful. Ugh. I can't believe I waited so long to try this place. Garlic parm fries-so much parm and garlic. Sooooo much parm. I love it. Keep adding more parm! lol Their homemade pickles are self serve. Have a bowl. It's got a slight kick to them. I enjoyed eating them. I love the way they have everything set up. If you're upstairs you don't have to go all the way down to get ketchup, napkins, pickles, etc. TL;DR-BETTER than In N Out, cheese burger and parm fries you won't be sorry! P. S. they have spiked milkshakes. (;
Went to visit San Francisco for the weekend. Arrived to our hotel around 8am and after getting settled in we needed to eat. We wanted something quick since it was around 11am already with 0 food in our system so we searched for a good burger joint near our hotel. From the pictures and the reviews we were sold. We got our son ready and in the stroller and enjoyed the walk to the place. Found it easily and instantly liked the place. Everything looked clean and the food menu was simple and sounded great. We ordered burgers and regular fries. The wait? Maybe 3 mins MAX. By the time we filled our soda glasses and sat the food was ready. The burgers were DELICIOUS absolutely loved them and juiciness of the meat. I hate pickles but my husband said the pickles were delicious also good crunch and flavor (they have those on the side not in the burger so you have to go get them yourself) All in all we were both happy with our first meal in San Francisco. (Our son isn't a big fan of meat so he ate some fruit from another place, but he loved the fries from here)
When visiting San Francisco, there there are so many great choices for dining out that a burger place is usually not on most people's list. Much less if that place is a chain. However, there are some times when you want something simple and fast. Those are the times that I will head to Super Duper Burgers. Their menu is pretty simple, containing burgers and chicken sandwiches along with shakes and fries. They also have breakfast, but I haven't been there for that yet.You can get your burger with many of the classic toppings (cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc.) and some special additions like upgraded cheese (Maytag blue), and the fries are plain or topped with garlic and cheese -- a shredded parmesan, I think.I usually get the Super Duper Burger, which comes out as two perfectly cooked and juicy patties, with cheese and lettuce/tomato/onion/pickles. Don't forget the pickles. They make them in-house and they're tasty: not too sour and not too sweet. You can get some extras from the jars they keep by the soda machine, and you can get some of the pickled chilies from the jar, too. Service is pretty quick and food comes out hot and fresh. In my experience, the shakes take a little extra time, but they are tasty and worth the wait.
Super Duper is the best fast food burger joint I've ever been. I don't like many burgers in this world, and I especially do not care for the McDonals, Burger Kings, etc version of burgers. I'd rather starve than eat a fast food burger.BUT! Thanks to a Yelp Elite (South Bay) event I got to experience SDB and boy, do I feel blessed. The veggie burg, cheese burg, and chicken sandwich are all so good! At this particular location, I tried their breakfast sandwich on a morning I was particularly starving. My morning smoothie wasn't going to cut it so I indulged in an egg, sausage, cheese and tomato sammy. OMG. So bomb.Also, with hunger swirling my brain around, I got swindled into getting the ultimate breakfast package which included a large coffee and THREE donuts. I certainly did not need all that but I am also glad it happened because holy cow those donuts were good. They were crispy and warm and sweet and I need one now.
This place makes deliciously juicy burgers and has a good variety of options. They are busy at all times but despite the long lines you get your food quickly. Shakes are good here too. I would say these burgers are a bit heavier than an In N Out burger but not as heavy as Five Guys so a nice middle ground.
Yeah, this place really is Super Duper. With such a cheesy name like Super Duper Burgers, you may have some reservations about this popular burger joint on Market Street. Once inside, you understand why they are popular. The restaurant has counter service with a rather large two-level dining area. Drinks and condiments are self-serve to help speed up the process.I chose the Mini Burger, which is really a decent 1/4 natural beef patty with the fixings. Paired with perfectly cooked French fries, this burger hit the spot. The rich flavor of the meat cut through the complementary grilled onions and optional cheddar cheese. The burger is nice and juicy with a loose texture indicative of fresh ground meat. The fries are near perfect with a great crisp texture and soft interior.You can easily add up the toppings and go overboard with extra sides, but I found the basics were nearly perfect which is a great sign. Even though they are very busy, they are fast and accurate with the orders. You can easily get a quick and wholesome burger fix here, and even an organic soft-serve cone after! Highly recommended.
tl;dr - The only thing "super duper" about this burger place is the name. The burgers were dry and flavorless and the garlic fries  cold and soggy. For $11 I would recommend getting 2x In-n-Out's double patty burgers with animal fries. "Super duper" burger: The 8oz double patty burger comes with lettuce and tomatoes between two toasted buns. The "medium" cooked burger was overly well done and very dry. The first two bites were like chalk dust and it only got marginally better once I bit into the mildly sauced middle. It didn't help that the burger was lukewarm (do they not make them fresh?) and almost greaseless (I'm not expecting a salad here). This burger falls far from its namesake.Garlic fries: Cold. Soggy. Kind of like fries you'd left overnight on the counter and then doused with some flavor to cover up the staleness. The garlic flavor was strong which I really liked but the snowy layer of cheese slid off like it didn't belong.
cheap egg sandwiches + avocado + four barrel coffee? count me in. can't go wrong with fried egg, fresh avocado and thick sliced cheddar.$6 for a bfast combo and they've got cheap homemade donuts too (those were a bit too oily + sweet for me though)will have to come back to try their lunch
The burger itself was absolutely delicious - I got the double patty with a bunch of toppings (some were free, some were extra). Meat was perfectly medium rare, and I loved seeing all the cheese ooze out of my burger. A messy meal for sure, but so good, and so well-deserved after a day of walking up and down those damn hills!  I also got their cheesy garlic fries - crispy, cheesy, garlicky goodness.This joint is very comparable to Shake Shack in the East Coast, and for good reason! Prices are very similar to each other, although Super Duper offers a lot more additional options that Shake Shack does not. This is a place I'd really like to see on the East Coast!
Super Duper Burgers; YOU ARE SUPER DUPER! Hands down, one of my favorite burger joints there is. From the burgers to the garlic fries and to the shakes; everything about this place is so delicious! Located in the mist of the shopping areas of Union Square, this is my favorite place to stop by. I usually get the mini burger which isn't mini at all. The difference between the mini and the super duper is that mini has one 4 oz. patty and the super duper has two 4 oz. patties. Hungry? Then get the super duper! Add the cheese for $0.50 extra because you won't regret it. It's perfectly melted onto the juicy patty. TOTALLY MOUTH WATERING GOODNESS. There are free toppings that you can add on such as lettuce, tomato, red onions, super sauce, jalapeno peppers, grilled onions and pickles. If you love to add an egg to your burgers, it's an extra $1.50 and it goes perfectly with the burger. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken sandwich which he completely loved. The chicken for the sandwich was perfectly grilled and super juicy. Pepper jack cheese goes great with it! Definitely would recommend you getting that if you're not much of a beef person. The garlic fries here...bomb. They have a generous topping of cheese and the garlic isn't overpowering. The shakes here are super tasty as well. My favorites are the vanilla or fresh strawberry shake. They come in a big glass cup that fills you up & it's organic! Try dipping your fries in your shake because it's actually pretty good.. if its not weird. For all you pickle lovers, they have homemade pickled jars for you to enjoy with your meal! Eat as much as you want! Service here is great. Even when it seems crowded, the lines move up pretty fast and your food is ready in about 5-10 minutes with the buzzer to tell you when it's ready. I wouldn't recommend taking your car to get here because it's crazy in this part of SF. All in all, definitely would recommend trying Super Duper even in any other locations they may have. Everything tastes super fresh and I literally love everything here!
The star of the super burger are the two patties. Even though the patties are quite oily, the flavour of the beef really comes through. The patties are very similar in flavour to those at Shake Shack. However, the presentation of the burger isn't as appealing. The shake is quite thick and creamy. The fries are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Super Duper Burgers is a much more fair comparison to Shack Shack than In N Out is to Shack Shack, both in terms of quality and pricing.
OK burger chain that is known less for its burgers than its other menu items.==FOOD==Super Duper Burger (8oz) w/ Cheese + Free Toppings: $7.75 || 2.5/5Thin beef patty. Not super juicy.Bun deflated quickly.Skimped on toppings quantity.Pricey for a standard burger.Garlic Fries: $3.00 || 3/5Not given much garlic, cheese, or fries.Unevenly fried. Some fries dripping in oil.==VIBE==Casual, busy, full of yuppies.Hard to find a place to sit during dinner hours.Tables are left messy and largely unattended to.==SERVICE==Couple mins wait time to order.Burger & fries served within 5 mins.==YAY/NAY==Nay. Not super or duper. Just normal burger & fries.No exceptional flavors or signature items.Save your $$ and buy an In-n-Out Double-Double for half the price and double the satisfaction.Want a good soft-serve? Go get a McFlurry.Garlic fries? Go to the local county fair for the real deal.
This review is really a comparison to TrueBurger in Oakland, and I might otherwise rate it higher. Based on the burger, I just can't do it! I got the mini-burger with cheese, which is just one patty and supposed to be cooked medium. I added caramelized onions as a free topping. This is identical to what I get at TrueBurger, but it didn't taste identical.The meat at Super Duper is VERY well seasoned, and all I could taste was salt. Some people may appreciate this. But I really couldn't taste the beef or the caramelized onions -- just the salty seasoning. The burger also didn't have the juiciness I've come to expect from this type of burger place.What I DID love was the milkshakes. This isn't the only place in the Bay that serves great milkshakes, but it's the only place I've found that offers them spiked! I added a shot of vodka to my Cookies & Cream milkshake -- incredibly good.
So it took me overnight to decide if I wanted to even write a review, but as a good patron I feel it's my duty to write a review on my experience so that others are aware. So based on the reviews I decided to give this place a try since I'm a burger person. 3 words for you Too Damn Greasy. I couldn't even eat it as the grease over powered the burger.
Great burger (double patty with everything) and milkshake. Nothing fancy just your classic American burger. The service was fast and the price was good. Might want to get here early for lunch, now 1230 and there's a line out the door.
My first charbroiledsuper duper double burger was beyond well done.  I was told that they are all cooked medium unless specified.Jules who was working the counter was nice enough to hook me up with a medium burger after my burger initially was so charred beyond the point that it had a burnt aftertaste.  Thankfully those complimentary pickles helped to cleanse my palate from the burntness.  I like to have like 10 paper towels handy...trust me you'll use them all....to absorb the waterfall of fat that just runs down when you squeeze into a super duper burger....yes it can be a hot mess but it's all love.  If your going to get fries here....goooo with the garlic fries.....no extra charge for more garlic FTW!
Must get: garlic parmesan fries!This place was packed when we came on a Friday night- a good sign for delicious food but also near impossible to find a place to sit. We opted to get our food to go instead of breathing down people's neck for their table. We got a super burger which is pretty much a double patty burger and a side of garlic parmesan fries. The fries were definitely the highlight of the meal. So satisfyingly garlicky that I wanted to come back the very next day. Best fries I had for a great value. The burger was decent but the patties were thin and a bit dry. Decent burger but compared to the fries.. Get the fries.
One of my favorite cheap places when I'm craving an oily, juicy burger, which does happen every so often! I've actually been to a few different locations, but I just happened to be at this one most recently.My standard order is a mini burger + cheese + mushrooms and garlic fries. The burger is always juicy, messy, and delicious; they tend to be a bit stingy with the garlic on the fries though. The cookies and cream shake is also thick and delicious, but I try not to be too much of a fatty every single time. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, which was actually surprisingly good but only offered at certain locations.I recently discovered that they serve breakfast too! I tried the egg sandwich + sausage and a mini glazed donut. The egg sandwich hit the spot exactly. The mini donut, though, was a bit oily and tasted too much like fried dough vs a donut. And yes, I know, a donut IS essentially fried dough, but the good ones are fluffy and have a particular taste - sweeter and more similar to a pastry. They also have fresh-squeezed orange juice for breakfast, if you want to try and feel healthier.I don't come here often, but it's exactly what I'm looking for when I'm craving a quick and dirty burger!
My boyfriend and I came here around 5:30 pm I believe, and it was pretty crowded! That means we knew we were at a good place to get some delicious burgers.The only thing I could think they could improve on is getting more options for burgers. I was a little confused on how the menu worked, but the staff was friendly and welcomed us for being first-timers. I got the veggie burger, which was SO GOOD! Probably the best veggie burger I've had. The black bean/corn patty was kind of crispy around the edges and softer towards the middle, which I love. The hummus was just a classic hummus, which paired nicely with the whole taste of the burger. The bun was nice and fluffy too. Nothing too memorable about the bun, but it was the perfect ratio of bun-to-filling.The inside of the place looked cool too. They even had an upstairs where my boyfriend and I sat, and it was cool looking down at the whole restaurant. It was nice and clean too.I would come again if I was craving just a simple burger/simple menu to choose from.
This spot is so conveniently located right next to my work, how can I not make it my regular spot? If I'm feeling like a healthy something, I could get chicken or a salad, and when I want to indulge ( and let's face it, it's more often than not ) I can get a juicy burger with all the goodies. My usual is a mini burger with avocado and Jack. The garlic fries are very flavorful and definitely worth the extra cash.One thing that keeps me coming back is the music I can really groove to and the friendly staff. Zarin is always around and very friendly ! He remembers you and is great at conversation while still staying very efficient and making everything run smoothly. The packers are always smiling and friendly and the ambiance is one of general good times. I haven't stayed to eat yet, but I might have to change that in the future when it's not during a busy hour !

Nothing too memorable about the bun, but it was the perfect ratio of bun-to-filling.The inside of the place looked cool too. They even had an upstairs where my boyfriend and I sat, and it was cool looking down at the whole restaurant. It was nice and clean too.I would come again if I was craving just a simple burger/simple menu to choose from.
This spot is so conveniently located right next to my work, how can I not make it my regular spot? If I'm feeling like a healthy something, I could get chicken or a salad, and when I want to indulge ( and let's face it, it's more often than not ) I can get a juicy burger with all the goodies. My usual is a mini burger with avocado and Jack. The garlic fries are very flavorful and definitely worth the extra cash.One thing that keeps me coming back is the music I can really groove to and the friendly staff. Zarin is always around and very friendly ! He remembers you and is great at conversation while still staying very efficient and making everything run smoothly. The packers are always smiling and friendly and the ambiance is one of general good times. I haven't stayed to eat yet, but I might have to change that in the future when it's not during a busy hour !
Burger game changer. All my coworkers have been telling me to try Super Duper because I've NEVER EVER tried it. We have literally been talking about this for a few months now lol. So today after a hard ass workout at Cardio Tone I bit the bullet and decided to stop by with two of my said coworkers for a bite. We got there at around 6:15pm on a Friday. We got lucky and beat the stream of people who came in after us. We also got the last big table. It smells so freaking good when you walk in. I was told to get a mini burger with cheese. I obliged and also added grilled onions because a burger always needs grilled onions. We shared an order of garlic fries as well. Seating-a lot of two people tables! See if you can push them together if you're 3+. We actually sat upstairs where they had a long wooden table that can accommodate a party of 6 ish. It's a nice area that overlooks the entire restaurant. There are munchkin tables outside. Some tall tables downstairs. Mini cheese burger-DELICIOUS. I think super duper knocks out In N Out... The pattie was so juicy and tender and perfectly cooked. It was a very good medium well. Just the tiniest amount of pink. It was perf! The cheddar was melted beautiful. Ugh. I can't believe I waited so long to try this place. Garlic parm fries-so much parm and garlic. Sooooo much parm. I love it. Keep adding more parm! lol Their homemade pickles are self serve. Have a bowl. It's got a slight kick to them. I enjoyed eating them. I love the way they have everything set up. If you're upstairs you don't have to go all the way down to get ketchup, napkins, pickles, etc. TL;DR-BETTER than In N Out, cheese burger and parm fries you won't be sorry! P. S. they have spiked milkshakes. (;
Went to visit San Francisco for the weekend. Arrived to our hotel around 8am and after getting settled in we needed to eat. We wanted something quick since it was around 11am already with 0 food in our system so we searched for a good burger joint near our hotel. From the pictures and the reviews we were sold. We got our son ready and in the stroller and enjoyed the walk to the place. Found it easily and instantly liked the place. Everything looked clean and the food menu was simple and sounded great. We ordered burgers and regular fries. The wait? Maybe 3 mins MAX. By the time we filled our soda glasses and sat the food was ready. The burgers were DELICIOUS absolutely loved them and juiciness of the meat. I hate pickles but my husband said the pickles were delicious also good crunch and flavor (they have those on the side not in the burger so you have to go get them yourself) All in all we were both happy with our first meal in San Francisco. (Our son isn't a big fan of meat so he ate some fruit from another place, but he loved the fries from here)
When visiting San Francisco, there there are so many great choices for dining out that a burger place is usually not on most people's list. Much less if that place is a chain. However, there are some times when you want something simple and fast. Those are the times that I will head to Super Duper Burgers. Their menu is pretty simple, containing burgers and chicken sandwiches along with shakes and fries. They also have breakfast, but I haven't been there for that yet.You can get your burger with many of the classic toppings (cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc.) and some special additions like upgraded cheese (Maytag blue), and the fries are plain or topped with garlic and cheese -- a shredded parmesan, I think.I usually get the Super Duper Burger, which comes out as two perfectly cooked and juicy patties, with cheese and lettuce/tomato/onion/pickles. Don't forget the pickles. They make them in-house and they're tasty: not too sour and not too sweet. You can get some extras from the jars they keep by the soda machine, and you can get some of the pickled chilies from the jar, too. Service is pretty quick and food comes out hot and fresh. In my experience, the shakes take a little extra time, but they are tasty and worth the wait.
Super Duper is the best fast food burger joint I've ever been. I don't like many burgers in this world, and I especially do not care for the McDonals, Burger Kings, etc version of burgers. I'd rather starve than eat a fast food burger.BUT! Thanks to a Yelp Elite (South Bay) event I got to experience SDB and boy, do I feel blessed. The veggie burg, cheese burg, and chicken sandwich are all so good! At this particular location, I tried their breakfast sandwich on a morning I was particularly starving. My morning smoothie wasn't going to cut it so I indulged in an egg, sausage, cheese and tomato sammy. OMG. So bomb.Also, with hunger swirling my brain around, I got swindled into getting the ultimate breakfast package which included a large coffee and THREE donuts. I certainly did not need all that but I am also glad it happened because holy cow those donuts were good. They were crispy and warm and sweet and I need one now.
This place makes deliciously juicy burgers and has a good variety of options. They are busy at all times but despite the long lines you get your food quickly. Shakes are good here too. I would say these burgers are a bit heavier than an In N Out burger but not as heavy as Five Guys so a nice middle ground.
Yeah, this place really is Super Duper. With such a cheesy name like Super Duper Burgers, you may have some reservations about this popular burger joint on Market Street. Once inside, you understand why they are popular. The restaurant has counter service with a rather large two-level dining area. Drinks and condiments are self-serve to help speed up the process.I chose the Mini Burger, which is really a decent 1/4 natural beef patty with the fixings. Paired with perfectly cooked French fries, this burger hit the spot. The rich flavor of the meat cut through the complementary grilled onions and optional cheddar cheese. The burger is nice and juicy with a loose texture indicative of fresh ground meat. The fries are near perfect with a great crisp texture and soft interior.You can easily add up the toppings and go overboard with extra sides, but I found the basics were nearly perfect which is a great sign. Even though they are very busy, they are fast and accurate with the orders. You can easily get a quick and wholesome burger fix here, and even an organic soft-serve cone after! Highly recommended.
tl;dr - The only thing "super duper" about this burger place is the name. The burgers were dry and flavorless and the garlic fries  cold and soggy. For $11 I would recommend getting 2x In-n-Out's double patty burgers with animal fries. "Super duper" burger: The 8oz double patty burger comes with lettuce and tomatoes between two toasted buns. The "medium" cooked burger was overly well done and very dry. The first two bites were like chalk dust and it only got marginally better once I bit into the mildly sauced middle. It didn't help that the burger was lukewarm (do they not make them fresh?) and almost greaseless (I'm not expecting a salad here). This burger falls far from its namesake.Garlic fries: Cold. Soggy. Kind of like fries you'd left overnight on the counter and then doused with some flavor to cover up the staleness. The garlic flavor was strong which I really liked but the snowy layer of cheese slid off like it didn't belong.
cheap egg sandwiches + avocado + four barrel coffee? count me in. can't go wrong with fried egg, fresh avocado and thick sliced cheddar.$6 for a bfast combo and they've got cheap homemade donuts too (those were a bit too oily + sweet for me though)will have to come back to try their lunch
The burger itself was absolutely delicious - I got the double patty with a bunch of toppings (some were free, some were extra). Meat was perfectly medium rare, and I loved seeing all the cheese ooze out of my burger. A messy meal for sure, but so good, and so well-deserved after a day of walking up and down those damn hills!  I also got their cheesy garlic fries - crispy, cheesy, garlicky goodness.This joint is very comparable to Shake Shack in the East Coast, and for good reason! Prices are very similar to each other, although Super Duper offers a lot more additional options that Shake Shack does not. This is a place I'd really like to see on the East Coast!
Super Duper Burgers; YOU ARE SUPER DUPER! Hands down, one of my favorite burger joints there is. From the burgers to the garlic fries and to the shakes; everything about this place is so delicious! Located in the mist of the shopping areas of Union Square, this is my favorite place to stop by. I usually get the mini burger which isn't mini at all. The difference between the mini and the super duper is that mini has one 4 oz. patty and the super duper has two 4 oz. patties. Hungry? Then get the super duper! Add the cheese for $0.50 extra because you won't regret it. It's perfectly melted onto the juicy patty. TOTALLY MOUTH WATERING GOODNESS. There are free toppings that you can add on such as lettuce, tomato, red onions, super sauce, jalapeno peppers, grilled onions and pickles. If you love to add an egg to your burgers, it's an extra $1.50 and it goes perfectly with the burger. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken sandwich which he completely loved. The chicken for the sandwich was perfectly grilled and super juicy. Pepper jack cheese goes great with it! Definitely would recommend you getting that if you're not much of a beef person. The garlic fries here...bomb. They have a generous topping of cheese and the garlic isn't overpowering. The shakes here are super tasty as well. My favorites are the vanilla or fresh strawberry shake. They come in a big glass cup that fills you up & it's organic! Try dipping your fries in your shake because it's actually pretty good.. if its not weird. For all you pickle lovers, they have homemade pickled jars for you to enjoy with your meal! Eat as much as you want! Service here is great. Even when it seems crowded, the lines move up pretty fast and your food is ready in about 5-10 minutes with the buzzer to tell you when it's ready. I wouldn't recommend taking your car to get here because it's crazy in this part of SF. All in all, definitely would recommend trying Super Duper even in any other locations they may have. Everything tastes super fresh and I literally love everything here!
The star of the super burger are the two patties. Even though the patties are quite oily, the flavour of the beef really comes through. The patties are very similar in flavour to those at Shake Shack. However, the presentation of the burger isn't as appealing. The shake is quite thick and creamy. The fries are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Super Duper Burgers is a much more fair comparison to Shack Shack than In N Out is to Shack Shack, both in terms of quality and pricing.
OK burger chain that is known less for its burgers than its other menu items.==FOOD==Super Duper Burger (8oz) w/ Cheese + Free Toppings: $7.75 || 2.5/5Thin beef patty. Not super juicy.Bun deflated quickly.Skimped on toppings quantity.Pricey for a standard burger.Garlic Fries: $3.00 || 3/5Not given much garlic, cheese, or fries.Unevenly fried. Some fries dripping in oil.==VIBE==Casual, busy, full of yuppies.Hard to find a place to sit during dinner hours.Tables are left messy and largely unattended to.==SERVICE==Couple mins wait time to order.Burger & fries served within 5 mins.==YAY/NAY==Nay. Not super or duper. Just normal burger & fries.No exceptional flavors or signature items.Save your $$ and buy an In-n-Out Double-Double for half the price and double the satisfaction.Want a good soft-serve? Go get a McFlurry.Garlic fries? Go to the local county fair for the real deal.
This review is really a comparison to TrueBurger in Oakland, and I might otherwise rate it higher. Based on the burger, I just can't do it! I got the mini-burger with cheese, which is just one patty and supposed to be cooked medium. I added caramelized onions as a free topping. This is identical to what I get at TrueBurger, but it didn't taste identical.The meat at Super Duper is VERY well seasoned, and all I could taste was salt. Some people may appreciate this. But I really couldn't taste the beef or the caramelized onions -- just the salty seasoning. The burger also didn't have the juiciness I've come to expect from this type of burger place.What I DID love was the milkshakes. This isn't the only place in the Bay that serves great milkshakes, but it's the only place I've found that offers them spiked! I added a shot of vodka to my Cookies & Cream milkshake -- incredibly good.
So it took me overnight to decide if I wanted to even write a review, but as a good patron I feel it's my duty to write a review on my experience so that others are aware. So based on the reviews I decided to give this place a try since I'm a burger person. 3 words for you Too Damn Greasy. I couldn't even eat it as the grease over powered the burger.
Great burger (double patty with everything) and milkshake. Nothing fancy just your classic American burger. The service was fast and the price was good. Might want to get here early for lunch, now 1230 and there's a line out the door.
My first charbroiledsuper duper double burger was beyond well done.  I was told that they are all cooked medium unless specified.Jules who was working the counter was nice enough to hook me up with a medium burger after my burger initially was so charred beyond the point that it had a burnt aftertaste.  Thankfully those complimentary pickles helped to cleanse my palate from the burntness.  I like to have like 10 paper towels handy...trust me you'll use them all....to absorb the waterfall of fat that just runs down when you squeeze into a super duper burger....yes it can be a hot mess but it's all love.  If your going to get fries here....goooo with the garlic fries.....no extra charge for more garlic FTW!
Must get: garlic parmesan fries!This place was packed when we came on a Friday night- a good sign for delicious food but also near impossible to find a place to sit. We opted to get our food to go instead of breathing down people's neck for their table. We got a super burger which is pretty much a double patty burger and a side of garlic parmesan fries. The fries were definitely the highlight of the meal. So satisfyingly garlicky that I wanted to come back the very next day. Best fries I had for a great value. The burger was decent but the patties were thin and a bit dry. Decent burger but compared to the fries.. Get the fries.
One of my favorite cheap places when I'm craving an oily, juicy burger, which does happen every so often! I've actually been to a few different locations, but I just happened to be at this one most recently.My standard order is a mini burger + cheese + mushrooms and garlic fries. The burger is always juicy, messy, and delicious; they tend to be a bit stingy with the garlic on the fries though. The cookies and cream shake is also thick and delicious, but I try not to be too much of a fatty every single time. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, which was actually surprisingly good but only offered at certain locations.I recently discovered that they serve breakfast too! I tried the egg sandwich + sausage and a mini glazed donut. The egg sandwich hit the spot exactly. The mini donut, though, was a bit oily and tasted too much like fried dough vs a donut. And yes, I know, a donut IS essentially fried dough, but the good ones are fluffy and have a particular taste - sweeter and more similar to a pastry. They also have fresh-squeezed orange juice for breakfast, if you want to try and feel healthier.I don't come here often, but it's exactly what I'm looking for when I'm craving a quick and dirty burger!
My boyfriend and I came here around 5:30 pm I believe, and it was pretty crowded! That means we knew we were at a good place to get some delicious burgers.The only thing I could think they could improve on is getting more options for burgers. I was a little confused on how the menu worked, but the staff was friendly and welcomed us for being first-timers. I got the veggie burger, which was SO GOOD! Probably the best veggie burger I've had. The black bean/corn patty was kind of crispy around the edges and softer towards the middle, which I love. The hummus was just a classic hummus, which paired nicely with the whole taste of the burger. The bun was nice and fluffy too. Nothing too memorable about the bun, but it was the perfect ratio of bun-to-filling.The inside of the place looked cool too.

The cookies and cream shake is also thick and delicious, but I try not to be too much of a fatty every single time. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, which was actually surprisingly good but only offered at certain locations.I recently discovered that they serve breakfast too! I tried the egg sandwich + sausage and a mini glazed donut. The egg sandwich hit the spot exactly. The mini donut, though, was a bit oily and tasted too much like fried dough vs a donut. And yes, I know, a donut IS essentially fried dough, but the good ones are fluffy and have a particular taste - sweeter and more similar to a pastry. They also have fresh-squeezed orange juice for breakfast, if you want to try and feel healthier.I don't come here often, but it's exactly what I'm looking for when I'm craving a quick and dirty burger!
My boyfriend and I came here around 5:30 pm I believe, and it was pretty crowded! That means we knew we were at a good place to get some delicious burgers.The only thing I could think they could improve on is getting more options for burgers. I was a little confused on how the menu worked, but the staff was friendly and welcomed us for being first-timers. I got the veggie burger, which was SO GOOD! Probably the best veggie burger I've had. The black bean/corn patty was kind of crispy around the edges and softer towards the middle, which I love. The hummus was just a classic hummus, which paired nicely with the whole taste of the burger. The bun was nice and fluffy too. Nothing too memorable about the bun, but it was the perfect ratio of bun-to-filling.The inside of the place looked cool too. They even had an upstairs where my boyfriend and I sat, and it was cool looking down at the whole restaurant. It was nice and clean too.I would come again if I was craving just a simple burger/simple menu to choose from.
This spot is so conveniently located right next to my work, how can I not make it my regular spot? If I'm feeling like a healthy something, I could get chicken or a salad, and when I want to indulge ( and let's face it, it's more often than not ) I can get a juicy burger with all the goodies. My usual is a mini burger with avocado and Jack. The garlic fries are very flavorful and definitely worth the extra cash.One thing that keeps me coming back is the music I can really groove to and the friendly staff. Zarin is always around and very friendly ! He remembers you and is great at conversation while still staying very efficient and making everything run smoothly. The packers are always smiling and friendly and the ambiance is one of general good times. I haven't stayed to eat yet, but I might have to change that in the future when it's not during a busy hour !
