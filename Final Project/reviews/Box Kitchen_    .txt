YUM! they have great food, hours and service- in that order and all with a high rating.I love that the bun is perfectly toasted and the meat is super flavorful, not to mention the bright greens added to the burger. greens are typically overlooked,but not here and I'm grateful. thank you, box kitchen for the beautiful textures and flavor.
The burger is amazing. Thick and juicy, piled with cheese and these greasy bacon bits. Not at all the type of burger you'd expect from a restaurant that is literally a hole in the wall.I showed up around 9:30pm. There were several people waiting outside. It took over 10 minutes to get my burger after I ordered it. Well worth the wait for something so delicious.
This hidden place is one of the best hamburgers place I ate. Small window in middle of nowhere but yet very busy say it all. The Box Burger is tick juicy and seasoned perfectly. Whoever knows me know that I have weakness for hamburgers and I will look for them everywhere I go (even if it is French restaurant ) and when I find one like this place I will share it with the world. You can skip the fries, but you might want a pickle  fries instead. Worth to come here and eat in this great place.
I've been in this area many times for conventions, but dam, I missed out hardcore on all the times I could have eaten here. After a long day of walking the Moscone, it was time for redemption. The stomach had to be filled and the vision had to get foggy. This corner is sketchy as f but be courageous and brave, and you'll be treated to the most unpretentious night of shenanigans. The Box Kitchen deal comes as a 2fer: good greasy food at Box Kitchen, followed by 5 dollar handles of beer. There's no losing here unless you hate having fun. Also, take your food into the Tempest bar next door, yes, it's allowed.-=-Tempest Burger-=- omg no meat, omg no patty, OMG NO MEAT. WTF. Yeah, I made a grave mistake, and people should reallyy stop using the word burger when there's no meaty goodness inside. Out came......an egg sandwich when I thought I was gonna have egg on my meat. Here's the deal though: if you like eggs benedict and don't feel like meat, you'll love this egg sandwich. It's not as big and filling as the Box Burger, but I still found it delicious.-=-Garlic Fries-=- Greasy, GOOD. Easily my favorite part of this meal. It's like a combo discount to get this with a sandwich like a few bucks or something. Fries are skinny cut and not a layer of potato was untouched by that garlic oil layer. You'll love it, and you'll always have to get it.
Stopped in for a bite while we were drinking next door at Tempest.  The burger was fantastic and the garlic fries were a great match (my inebriated friends definitely agreed).  My guy enjoyed the falafel wrap.  Great late night bar food.
I have never held onto a bag of food and wanted to eat like a pig whilst walking as badly as the day I bought box kitchen. The box burger and the chicken sandwich were both bomb.com and I can say no more! We also ordered the potato skins and maaaan.... I'm just speechless.The ultimate comfort food especially for after a night of drinking, which is convenient because it's located right next to tempest. Come early on weekend or game nights because there won't be any indoor seating left. (We ate in the car because stupid little ol' me forgot that there was a warriors game)
The Box. This place...I'll go out there and say it. The Box Burger is one of the most underrated burgers in San Francisco. It's a well-kept secret, but it has a cultish following, myself included.Honorable mention: the chicken sando. A chicken sandwich is typically nothing to write home about. Restaurants have the burger, and then the chicken sandwich is an afterthought. Not at the Box. By far the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Better than most burgers. Who the heck puts slaw on a chicken sandwich? A genius. That's who.Also of notable fame: the garlic fries. Best enjoyed drunk.
On our way to watch a concert, some friends and I decided to stop at a joint in an alley called Box Kitchen. It was recommend we go there as a super small spot that packs a lot of flavor. I was excited. It's true, this place is literally a stand. You have the kitchen and then an ordering table and that's it. Plan on eating along the sidewalk OR you can go to Tempest, a bar next door and eat there (but have the courtesy of buying a drink from Tempest). I love how their menu is written on metal panels and that their kitchen seems clean! That's about all I can talk about when it comes to the place so here's what I had: -Box Burger for $9 and added fries for an extra $2. Ground chuck burger, bacon shallot gastrique, white cheddar, lettuce, tomato, crispy shallots on a potato bun. WOW, lots of flavor. This burger was on point. I've had a few burgers in my days but this definitely stuck out to me. I loved that they decided to add crispy shallots, lot the different textures. The lettuce they used was arugula so I also got the spiciness in my overall flavor. WOW, this was definitely a crowd pleaser and I highly recommend it! Turn down Natoma alley and look for this joint! If you're fortunate enough to find it, you'll really love their food. Simple menu, friend staff and their food is the epitome of flavortown!
Yum! The take-out portion of Box Kitchen definitely has a rustic feel. Now don't expect the service to be fast, whether there is a line or not. They take their time putting together the burgers. But, I'd say the wait is worth it!You must try the hamburger, priced at $9 is pretty decent. I savored every bite!
omgomgomgomg. If you're ever having midnight drunchies (let's be real, we all have those at least a few times a week), BOX KITCHEN will satisfy your drunchies. But really though, you can come here sober and it'll be just as good. After eating the whole day in SF, my friend and I decided to get two things and share. It was super hard to narrow down our choices and it doesn't help that they have a lot of potato entrees! I stared down the menu for a good 10 minutes trying to decide if I wanted garlic fries or potato skins. I ended up getting potato skins and a box burger. HOLY SHIZ, the potato skins were DIVINE. I just wished i hadn't devoured them that quickly. The burger was good, but not as good as the potato skins. If any of y'all are thinking about coming here, don't count the calories and just get the potato skins. Like nike says, JUST DO IT. The best part about this place is that it's located next to louie's bar, so you can grab a drink while you wait to have a foodgasm. Nightly food services start at 4:20pm and end at 1am.
Two words. Potato Skins. Get 'em. It's seriously the best thing I ate on my trip to San Francisco. The quail egg served on top of tender juicy pork belly. It was like a bomb in your mouth. The vendor recommended the Box Burger, it was pretty good but not amazing. It's no where near as amazing as the Potato Skins. The Box Burger is served with bacon so that's a bonus.There's no seating because it's a little take out window, but a lot of people would bring the food into the bar next door. Great place for bar food or drunchies.
Are you kidding me? Eat everything they make. My 2 favorite are the Roasted potato skins with crispy pork belly, charred green onions, gouda cheese, cream and a quail egg...I added grilled serrano peppers. And the Baby Corn Elote - chipotle lime butter, elote spice, garlic aioli, queso fresco, radish, lime
Solid greasy food served up pretty fast in a back alley. Nice folks, nice prices, good stuff.
Sober or not I would never come here again. We had the rudest person take our order, the food was absolutely gross, and there were beggars everywhere. All this combined, I wish I could give less than a star. My friends and I wondered over to this hole in the wall after several drinks around midnight. There were only two people ahead of us in line, so I guess it wasn't that busy yet? You would think the staff would be nicer since there wasn't a huge crowd. But no, the staff was rude and unwelcoming. Despite this experience, we ordered potato skins, hush puppies, and garlic fries to share. Here's my breakdown:potato skins- nothing outstanding. literally chunks of potato put back in the skins with sour cream, cheese, and bacon. You would think it's great, but no- it wasn't. hushpuppies- extremely dry with no flavor, how can you even call them hush puppiesgarlic fries- drenched in oil, I wasn't aware we ordered a pool of oil with a side of fries. The food here made my drunchies disappear after a bite. I can only imagine how unappetizing the food would be sober.
Box kitchen will definitely be added on to my late night adventure to the city for food. It is located in an alley where your order is taken through a window. Box Kitchen is like one of the hidden gems. My friend and I both got the chicken sandwich which was delicioussssss. My favorite was the garlic Parmesan fries, their fries are sooooo good. The workers here were pretty cool and nice. The guy who took my order was very patient with me. While I was waiting for my food, I also notice that they have a lot of regulars who come by and everyone who worked there seemed happy. I recommend taking the food to go because there are no seats and everything is outdoor. there is also a lot across the street that you can park in. There is a bar right next door so I can only imagine how busy it gets when people start getting hungry at the bar. It took about 15 mins for us to get the food. Overall, I cant wait to come back and try other foods on the menu!
The place is located off a small street that seems very sketchy but it's worth it for how good this burger is. I've had this burger twice now and each time it is cooked perfectly. The meat blend is delicious. The sharp melted cheddar on top is a perfect addition to this burger. The bun was slightly toasted. Pair this with garlic fries and its the perfect meal. So much fresh garlic that is finger licking good. This is one of the best burgers I've ever had!
Fucking excellent. Great burger, perfectly crispy garlic fries, this place is literally a hole in the wall, but it's some of the best food I've had in SF so far.
Those potato skins are pretty great. The smokiness of gouda, the crack of the pork belly, the mini egg (quail I believe) all come together for a pretty decadent bite. I'd share them, since eating all three (which I did yesterday) is kind of a lot.
I came here on a Friday night with a friend. There were only one or two and people ahead of us - still, the food took 15-20 minutes to come out. I guess that's why there's a sign asking you to be patient at the top! We got our food and then walked to Yerba Buena gardens and ate it there, since there's no seating area outside the hole in the wall.We ordered three things total: the Box Burger, potato skins, and some burger made of fried kale and egg. The Box Burger might've been the best burger I've ever had. And I've had many (gourmet-ish) burgers in my life. The patty is cooked to a medium rare is and is extremely juicy, and the burger itself has a ton of texture (via the fried shallots) and flavor (via the thick chunks of bacon it comes with.) I could probably die happy eating this burger for the rest of my life. If you're here, I definitely recommend you try the Box Burger!We also got to try the roasted potato skins which are topped with more thick cut bacon, a quail egg, and cheese. I got the cheese on the side because I'm not a fan of cheese (I'm terrible, I know.) The roasted potato skins were really yummy, but were also really rich; not sure if I'd recommend getting a burger at the potato skins together, as that might be too much food. They also come with a side of ranch so you can dress your potato skin to your heart's content (although there's a ton of flavor without the ranch already!)My friend got the kale and egg burger, and she absolutely loved it! I was confused by the existence of a burger without meat, so I didn't think too much of it, but she was a huge fan. So, if you're looking for something lighter, that's recommended as well.All in all, the food was super delicious and pretty cheap for a meal of that size. I'd definitely come back again!
Got Dive?  Well... this place meets the bill for a quick escape during lunch hour.  And they have a full bar at the Tempest with lots of interesting beers on tap.  I was attending RSA this year and Yelped a good burger place, and the Box Kitchen showed me the way. And my Yelp peeps did not disappoint.  The menu is pretty limited, but the burger is what you want.  It is quite good as others have mentioned, as well as the fries... what a fulfilling lunch and definitely worth the caloric splurge in my opinion.  I do want to make it back to the Tempest some day for some pre-game drinks as it looks like a really cool hangout.
YUM! they have great food, hours and service- in that order and all with a high rating.I love that the bun is perfectly toasted and the meat is super flavorful, not to mention the bright greens added to the burger. greens are typically overlooked,but not here and I'm grateful. thank you, box kitchen for the beautiful textures and flavor.

I've been in this area many times for conventions, but dam, I missed out hardcore on all the times I could have eaten here. After a long day of walking the Moscone, it was time for redemption. The stomach had to be filled and the vision had to get foggy. This corner is sketchy as f but be courageous and brave, and you'll be treated to the most unpretentious night of shenanigans. The Box Kitchen deal comes as a 2fer: good greasy food at Box Kitchen, followed by 5 dollar handles of beer. There's no losing here unless you hate having fun.

My 2 favorite are the Roasted potato skins with crispy pork belly, charred green onions, gouda cheese, cream and a quail egg...I added grilled serrano peppers. And the Baby Corn Elote - chipotle lime butter, elote spice, garlic aioli, queso fresco, radish, lime
Solid greasy food served up pretty fast in a back alley. Nice folks, nice prices, good stuff.
Sober or not I would never come here again. We had the rudest person take our order, the food was absolutely gross, and there were beggars everywhere. All this combined, I wish I could give less than a star. My friends and I wondered over to this hole in the wall after several drinks around midnight. There were only two people ahead of us in line, so I guess it wasn't that busy yet? You would think the staff would be nicer since there wasn't a huge crowd. But no, the staff was rude and unwelcoming. Despite this experience, we ordered potato skins, hush puppies, and garlic fries to share. Here's my breakdown:potato skins- nothing outstanding. literally chunks of potato put back in the skins with sour cream, cheese, and bacon. You would think it's great, but no- it wasn't. hushpuppies- extremely dry with no flavor, how can you even call them hush puppiesgarlic fries- drenched in oil, I wasn't aware we ordered a pool of oil with a side of fries. The food here made my drunchies disappear after a bite. I can only imagine how unappetizing the food would be sober.
Box kitchen will definitely be added on to my late night adventure to the city for food. It is located in an alley where your order is taken through a window. Box Kitchen is like one of the hidden gems. My friend and I both got the chicken sandwich which was delicioussssss. My favorite was the garlic Parmesan fries, their fries are sooooo good. The workers here were pretty cool and nice. The guy who took my order was very patient with me. While I was waiting for my food, I also notice that they have a lot of regulars who come by and everyone who worked there seemed happy. I recommend taking the food to go because there are no seats and everything is outdoor. there is also a lot across the street that you can park in. There is a bar right next door so I can only imagine how busy it gets when people start getting hungry at the bar. It took about 15 mins for us to get the food. Overall, I cant wait to come back and try other foods on the menu!
The place is located off a small street that seems very sketchy but it's worth it for how good this burger is. I've had this burger twice now and each time it is cooked perfectly. The meat blend is delicious. The sharp melted cheddar on top is a perfect addition to this burger. The bun was slightly toasted. Pair this with garlic fries and its the perfect meal. So much fresh garlic that is finger licking good. This is one of the best burgers I've ever had!
Fucking excellent. Great burger, perfectly crispy garlic fries, this place is literally a hole in the wall, but it's some of the best food I've had in SF so far.
Those potato skins are pretty great. The smokiness of gouda, the crack of the pork belly, the mini egg (quail I believe) all come together for a pretty decadent bite. I'd share them, since eating all three (which I did yesterday) is kind of a lot.
I came here on a Friday night with a friend. There were only one or two and people ahead of us - still, the food took 15-20 minutes to come out. I guess that's why there's a sign asking you to be patient at the top! We got our food and then walked to Yerba Buena gardens and ate it there, since there's no seating area outside the hole in the wall.We ordered three things total: the Box Burger, potato skins, and some burger made of fried kale and egg. The Box Burger might've been the best burger I've ever had. And I've had many (gourmet-ish) burgers in my life. The patty is cooked to a medium rare is and is extremely juicy, and the burger itself has a ton of texture (via the fried shallots) and flavor (via the thick chunks of bacon it comes with.) I could probably die happy eating this burger for the rest of my life. If you're here, I definitely recommend you try the Box Burger!We also got to try the roasted potato skins which are topped with more thick cut bacon, a quail egg, and cheese. I got the cheese on the side because I'm not a fan of cheese (I'm terrible, I know.) The roasted potato skins were really yummy, but were also really rich; not sure if I'd recommend getting a burger at the potato skins together, as that might be too much food. They also come with a side of ranch so you can dress your potato skin to your heart's content (although there's a ton of flavor without the ranch already!)My friend got the kale and egg burger, and she absolutely loved it! I was confused by the existence of a burger without meat, so I didn't think too much of it, but she was a huge fan. So, if you're looking for something lighter, that's recommended as well.All in all, the food was super delicious and pretty cheap for a meal of that size. I'd definitely come back again!
Got Dive?  Well... this place meets the bill for a quick escape during lunch hour.  And they have a full bar at the Tempest with lots of interesting beers on tap.  I was attending RSA this year and Yelped a good burger place, and the Box Kitchen showed me the way. And my Yelp peeps did not disappoint.  The menu is pretty limited, but the burger is what you want.  It is quite good as others have mentioned, as well as the fries... what a fulfilling lunch and definitely worth the caloric splurge in my opinion.  I do want to make it back to the Tempest some day for some pre-game drinks as it looks like a really cool hangout.
YUM! they have great food, hours and service- in that order and all with a high rating.I love that the bun is perfectly toasted and the meat is super flavorful, not to mention the bright greens added to the burger. greens are typically overlooked,but not here and I'm grateful. thank you, box kitchen for the beautiful textures and flavor.
The burger is amazing. Thick and juicy, piled with cheese and these greasy bacon bits. Not at all the type of burger you'd expect from a restaurant that is literally a hole in the wall.I showed up around 9:30pm. There were several people waiting outside. It took over 10 minutes to get my burger after I ordered it. Well worth the wait for something so delicious.
This hidden place is one of the best hamburgers place I ate. Small window in middle of nowhere but yet very busy say it all. The Box Burger is tick juicy and seasoned perfectly. Whoever knows me know that I have weakness for hamburgers and I will look for them everywhere I go (even if it is French restaurant ) and when I find one like this place I will share it with the world. You can skip the fries, but you might want a pickle  fries instead. Worth to come here and eat in this great place.
I've been in this area many times for conventions, but dam, I missed out hardcore on all the times I could have eaten here. After a long day of walking the Moscone, it was time for redemption. The stomach had to be filled and the vision had to get foggy. This corner is sketchy as f but be courageous and brave, and you'll be treated to the most unpretentious night of shenanigans. The Box Kitchen deal comes as a 2fer: good greasy food at Box Kitchen, followed by 5 dollar handles of beer. There's no losing here unless you hate having fun. Also, take your food into the Tempest bar next door, yes, it's allowed.-=-Tempest Burger-=- omg no meat, omg no patty, OMG NO MEAT. WTF. Yeah, I made a grave mistake, and people should reallyy stop using the word burger when there's no meaty goodness inside. Out came......an egg sandwich when I thought I was gonna have egg on my meat. Here's the deal though: if you like eggs benedict and don't feel like meat, you'll love this egg sandwich. It's not as big and filling as the Box Burger, but I still found it delicious.-=-Garlic Fries-=- Greasy, GOOD. Easily my favorite part of this meal. It's like a combo discount to get this with a sandwich like a few bucks or something. Fries are skinny cut and not a layer of potato was untouched by that garlic oil layer. You'll love it, and you'll always have to get it.
Stopped in for a bite while we were drinking next door at Tempest.  The burger was fantastic and the garlic fries were a great match (my inebriated friends definitely agreed).  My guy enjoyed the falafel wrap.  Great late night bar food.
I have never held onto a bag of food and wanted to eat like a pig whilst walking as badly as the day I bought box kitchen. The box burger and the chicken sandwich were both bomb.com and I can say no more! We also ordered the potato skins and maaaan.... I'm just speechless.The ultimate comfort food especially for after a night of drinking, which is convenient because it's located right next to tempest. Come early on weekend or game nights because there won't be any indoor seating left. (We ate in the car because stupid little ol' me forgot that there was a warriors game)
The Box. This place...I'll go out there and say it. The Box Burger is one of the most underrated burgers in San Francisco. It's a well-kept secret, but it has a cultish following, myself included.Honorable mention: the chicken sando. A chicken sandwich is typically nothing to write home about. Restaurants have the burger, and then the chicken sandwich is an afterthought. Not at the Box. By far the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. Better than most burgers. Who the heck puts slaw on a chicken sandwich? A genius. That's who.Also of notable fame: the garlic fries. Best enjoyed drunk.
On our way to watch a concert, some friends and I decided to stop at a joint in an alley called Box Kitchen. It was recommend we go there as a super small spot that packs a lot of flavor. I was excited. It's true, this place is literally a stand. You have the kitchen and then an ordering table and that's it. Plan on eating along the sidewalk OR you can go to Tempest, a bar next door and eat there (but have the courtesy of buying a drink from Tempest). I love how their menu is written on metal panels and that their kitchen seems clean! That's about all I can talk about when it comes to the place so here's what I had: -Box Burger for $9 and added fries for an extra $2. Ground chuck burger, bacon shallot gastrique, white cheddar, lettuce, tomato, crispy shallots on a potato bun. WOW, lots of flavor. This burger was on point. I've had a few burgers in my days but this definitely stuck out to me. I loved that they decided to add crispy shallots, lot the different textures. The lettuce they used was arugula so I also got the spiciness in my overall flavor. WOW, this was definitely a crowd pleaser and I highly recommend it! Turn down Natoma alley and look for this joint! If you're fortunate enough to find it, you'll really love their food. Simple menu, friend staff and their food is the epitome of flavortown!
Yum! The take-out portion of Box Kitchen definitely has a rustic feel. Now don't expect the service to be fast, whether there is a line or not. They take their time putting together the burgers. But, I'd say the wait is worth it!You must try the hamburger, priced at $9 is pretty decent. I savored every bite!
omgomgomgomg. If you're ever having midnight drunchies (let's be real, we all have those at least a few times a week), BOX KITCHEN will satisfy your drunchies. But really though, you can come here sober and it'll be just as good. After eating the whole day in SF, my friend and I decided to get two things and share. It was super hard to narrow down our choices and it doesn't help that they have a lot of potato entrees! I stared down the menu for a good 10 minutes trying to decide if I wanted garlic fries or potato skins. I ended up getting potato skins and a box burger. HOLY SHIZ, the potato skins were DIVINE. I just wished i hadn't devoured them that quickly. The burger was good, but not as good as the potato skins. If any of y'all are thinking about coming here, don't count the calories and just get the potato skins. Like nike says, JUST DO IT. The best part about this place is that it's located next to louie's bar, so you can grab a drink while you wait to have a foodgasm. Nightly food services start at 4:20pm and end at 1am.
Two words. Potato Skins. Get 'em. It's seriously the best thing I ate on my trip to San Francisco. The quail egg served on top of tender juicy pork belly. It was like a bomb in your mouth. The vendor recommended the Box Burger, it was pretty good but not amazing. It's no where near as amazing as the Potato Skins. The Box Burger is served with bacon so that's a bonus.There's no seating because it's a little take out window, but a lot of people would bring the food into the bar next door. Great place for bar food or drunchies.
Are you kidding me? Eat everything they make. My 2 favorite are the Roasted potato skins with crispy pork belly, charred green onions, gouda cheese, cream and a quail egg...I added grilled serrano peppers. And the Baby Corn Elote - chipotle lime butter, elote spice, garlic aioli, queso fresco, radish, lime
Solid greasy food served up pretty fast in a back alley. Nice folks, nice prices, good stuff.
