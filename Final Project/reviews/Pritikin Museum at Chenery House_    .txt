There's a kind of unreality in the old Pritikin place
This is a really sad place. Both the man, Bob Pritikin and the estate are in total decline. it may have once been nice, but now, it is totally run down, and misrepresented in the video when you google it. Â the grounds are a mess, full of weeds (maybe good citizenship not to use water, but mostly brown) and sad. The house reeks of (presumably) dog urine from a sweet, but smelly dog. Some of the objects inside are interesting/fun and the view is stunning. However.....there are also an equal number of tasteless and even offensive things which he are on display. there is a replica (possibly real) model of an electric chair which the assistant turned on and the fake person in it shakes in an disturbing/please turn the off sort of way. You are then served lunch which was awful and consisted of small salad and then a plate full of carbs- no lie- worse that school cafeteria- potato salad, pasta with flecks of chicken in a cream sauce and a bun. then instant coffee and chocolate that had been sitting out in the sun during the tour. Admittedly, the pool side where we ate was the nicest part cause no dog smell and a bright sunny spotSo for a $100.00 per person- find a better way to enjoy SF's idiosyncrasies!
