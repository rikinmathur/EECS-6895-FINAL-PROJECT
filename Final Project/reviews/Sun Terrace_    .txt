Don't get thrown off by the "100 First Garage" lettering of the underlying garage's entrance (you're still on Mission Street!), the abandoned lot currently across the street, or the construction scaffolding you see when you peer up the stairs.Climb the four flights of stairs and you'll be graced by a beautiful terrace spruced with trees, ripply water walls, lounge chairs and lunch chairs!This is a great place to read and eat, and it certainly provides a relaxing retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.Unfortunately, the chairs and tables are bolted into the ground, so you'll have to make do with their arrangement.
A neat hidden spot! It can get crowded during lunch. There aren't enough tables/chairs. There are neat cemented walls (really short ones) that you can sit on and have your lunch.
Super nice hidden POPO. It's up the stairs from the sidewalk and there's no plaque outside so you have to know it's there. Upstairs there's a large patio area with a fountain, trees and lots of different seating - benches, cafe tables, lounge-y chairs - and you get your pick of sun or shade. We arrived around noon and it was fairly empty but by the time we left it was pretty full though there was still plenty of room because it was so big. You can still hear the street traffic but you can't see it so it feels a little removed.
The Sun Terrace is an excellent privately owned pubilc space (POPOS) in the city - perfect for taking a break for FiDi workers or tourists looking to take a break from wandering aimless through downtown. What is great about this space is that it is open all week long including weekends. It can get busy here during the week, fyi (morning coffee and lunch breaks drive peak crowds).
My new favorite reading spot.Gives you nice panoramic shotsThe scene is quietit's free, don't need to buy itIt's like superman's fortress of solitudeit's a good place to get some sanity and mental fortitudeKind of don't want to hype this place too much because I don't want more people coming, but it's a great little find in SF.  One of the public areas that are mandated in SF.  It's a great place to read and grab lunch.  Generally quiet and has a serene feeling in the midst of a busy city environment.
This little sun terrace is perfect for daytime lounging! It's a clean and gorgeous spot in the city. It's often quiet, and you'll see a few other people (but not too many) on the terrace. It's more spacious than you'd expect, with several distinct areas, and a gorgeous water feature. Tables and chairs are set up for you, too. It's surrounded on all sides by gleaming city buildings, but that's not necessarily a bad thing-- those urban surroundings make this place seem like even more of an oasis.At night, it's eerie. I wanted a nighttime picnic spot in the city, and I tried this place. Was that silly of me? Probably. But I did come here one evening after dark, and let's just say that things get sketchy. Though this spot is, according to several sources, open 24/7, don't come here after sunset.
We call it "the oasis," which I think describes it pretty well.It's pretty quiet up there, and the waterfall gives it a nice, relaxing feeling. There are plenty of seats and chairs to eat lunch. Not too surprisingly, the seats are attached to the ground. Keep in mind this place closes at night, after 9 or 10pm.
It's a hidden treasure in the middle of downtown.  The breeze seems to slow here and the sun shines a little brighter.  You almost can't even hear the city around you.Take the stairs next to the boba place on Mission up to the top of the parking garage.  You'll see trees and plots of grass, a water sculpture, tables and chairs, and if you have a mirror, a smile on your face.  Whoever cleans this place does a great job, because it's always been spotless every time I've suck up to spend a late lunch.Plus the boba downstairs ain't half bad.
Good place to eat lunch on SoMa. I tend to eat on the later side, and that being said, it's hard sometimes to find a spot to sit. Especially on good weather days. Otherwise it's very clean and has plenty of variety of seating. I wish the chairs were chained to the table rather than bolted to the concrete, because the chairs are just a little to far back from the table. But you can also sit on the grass, on the concrete planter, or along the fountain.And for those architecture/construction people out there, excellent viewing spot for the transbay and the office tower going up next to it.
Great place to take a work break and lounge with a friend.
If you didn't know any better, you'd have no idea you were sitting on the top of a parking garage in the middle of SOMA.SPUR just released a list of the city's many, many POPOS (Privately Owned Public Open Spaces), and during an unseasonable "heat wave" like the one we've been experiencing all week, it calls for taking the laptop and hitting the road! Temperatures aren't going to be this comfy all the time, so you simply have to strike while the iron (or in this case, Mr. Sunshine!) is hot.The Sun Terrace is right next to the tall brown building at 100 First Street. You enter the terrace through the stairs in between the parking garage and the building itself. A short jaunt up to the 2nd floor, and you're basking in the midday sun amongst man made waterfalls, well kept topiary creations, vibrant flowers, and plenty of areas to sit, no matter what you're trying to accomplish. There are cafe chairs and tables for working on your computer, concrete benches for kickin' back with a good book, and even grassy patches for taking a quick power nap in between phone meetings. The latter I actually witnessed, as a man in a three piece suit came over, laid in the grass for about 30 minutes, then woke up to the sound of his iPhone alarm and sauntered back to work. Talk about a great way to spend a lunch, huh?There are over 50 of these POPOS around the city, and you'd be a fool not to take advantage of them. This particular sun deck is pretty grand, though... and close to my office to boot! Just another item to add to the laundry list of reasons why I'm madly in love with this city.
A nice outside space in SOMA where you can hang out and have your lunch in the sun (that is, when the sun cooperates).  This area is much more crowded than other rooftop public spaces downtown, and it is only one story up, but it makes up for some of that with abundant grassy spaces and seating (both at tables and on the concrete walls).  Plus you don't need to sign in in the lobby to get here.  Just a few steps up and you are removed from the bustle of Mission Street.
I'm in love with this place. A sunny, quiet getaway from noisy, bustling SOMA. This is the perfect place to bring your lunch or take a quick reading break. I love the fact that it is always sunny and warm here. The view is gorgeous and there are plenty of tables and chairs for groups of people. Easy to miss - but a hidden gem for sure.
Sun Terrace...public open spaces with a gorgeous roof garden above a parking garage in SOMA.  Equipped with fountains, landscaping, and multiple tables.  This developer is all about the third wheel as the tables seat three and the chairs are mounted to the ground.  The fourth goer in the lunch-bunch crew gets the shaft.This place is super close to TONS of lunch spots in the city...and it's great because its sheltered from the wind, city noises are muffled by the water, and the entire garden is manicured and well-grown into.This is the scruffy clad man hangin' out by the jukebox with his hood up at a non-sceney dive bar.  Read: understated hidden gem (that you like for all the right reasons).The only thing this place needs is a Zen garden.  Best place to spend your lunch break with a few, and only a few, friends.
Awesome place in SOMA to eat lunch. It is my go to spot to bring my lunch at work. Plenty of seating and tons of shade. It's also really close to TruckStopSF if you want your truck stop fix.
Great lunch spot in SoMa! You really wouldn't know it if you weren't looking for it. It's up a set of stairs which do a great job of isolating it from the hustle and bustle of Mission St. Clean, fountains, grass, tables... you can't ask for more in the middle of a downtown!Also noteworthy: this is a public space, so grab food from anywhere and bring it here.
