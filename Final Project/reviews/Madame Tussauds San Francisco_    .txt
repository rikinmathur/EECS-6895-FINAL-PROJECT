This place is AMAZINGStephen Curry? Peter Dinklage?My eyes went wild just walking around this place. It's too much excitement to take in all at once!The wax figures all look so real. Especially the beard on some of the figures like Peter Dinklage. Up close, it looked so real it's crazy. Plus they let me touch the figures, which actually felt kind of real and pretty neat. It's hard to describe the feeling unless you're there.I liked the singer room the most. Being surrounded by standing figures of Rihanna, Beyonce, Madonna, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Aniston, and Adele at the same time felt surreal. You can see the life-size height, the body, the facial expression. It's as close to meeting them as I will ever get in this life time :) Ever harder to get all of them in the same room.2Pac was there too. I thought he was dead!I knew Obama is really tall. Did you know Steve Jobs is actually a bit taller? I did not know that. Christian Bale is really tall in real life too--it was hard to tell since he is also quite buff in the Batman movies.The exhibit was also very much San-Francisco-themed, with some areas decorated after Lombard Street, Golden Gate, and Cafe Zoetrope where they made the Godfather. Great for bringing friends from out-of-town, especially when passing by Fisherman's Wharf.Overall, a really GREAT place to visit. Definitely have to check out this place. I know I'll be going back again and again with friends and family.
Creepy but fun!I enjoyed seeing these life-like wax figures and get up close and personal with Hollywood favorite celebrities, sports and historical wax figures. It's probably as close as I can get to the real star. This location in San Francisco opened in June 2014 so it's fairly new? Our visit here wasn't planned, it was a spur of the moment idea and the cheapest rate we could find was through the Madame Tussaud's website and purchased the tickets online at $19.75 + fees/adult ($16 if you live within the 9 local Bay Area counties).This location had less wax figures compared to the other Madame Tussaud's I've visited in the past (London UK and Las Vegas NV), but still I enjoyed visiting each figure and reading their little captions and their stories. San Francisco had figures that is part of San Francisco's history -- Al Capone (imprisoned in Alcatraz), Harvey Milk (gay rights activist), Janis Joplin (who lived down Haight, Ashbury area of San Francisco}, Robin Williams who lived in Tiburon, Francis Ford Coppola (film maker and owns two prominent wineries in Northern CA), Edwin Lee (first Asian-American Mayor in SF's history), Joseph Strauss (chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge and it wouldn't be complete if there were no wax figure representing the California Gold Rush, enter John Sutter. The wax displays were in sections-- movie celebrities, music artists, sports figures and historical figures (presidents and activists, etc).  So as I walked along and checked out each wax display I became co-director with Steven Spielberg, I flew E.T. home, I played ball with NBA's Stephan Curry (#30 Golden State Warriors), I sat next to George Clooney, I hitchhiked with Robin Williams along Lombard Street, I caught up with Christian Bale before he starts fighting crime in Gotham City, I took a mug shot near Al Capone's prison cell, had tea with Audrey Hepburn at Tiffany's, made an Uma Thurman dance move with John Travolta (Pulp Fiction), walked along the London streets with the Fab Four "Beatles", and sat on the bench with the Comeback Kid #16 (guess?).  These were just a few of the wax figure displays here in the San Francisco location.There were props available for fun photo ops and you can show off your selfie in Instagram, Facebook and Twitter at #MTSFselfie.  This made for a fun afternoon. Hope they add more celebrity figures in the future. Funny how the museum had a wax of Selena Gomez and not Justin Beiber... just saying.
I was able to visit Madame Tussauds because I got a free ticket with my Big Bus Tour. While it was enjoyable and interesting, I am glad that I did not have to pay as I don't believe it is entirely worth $20-30.PROS:-Interactive exhibits (e.g. "Gay Pride" posters to hold near Castro district)-Informative San Francisco history exhibits-Interesting exhibit displaying how wax figures are made-Nice staffCONS:-Underwhelming amount of wax figures-Slightly scary (for my girlfriend) - although it could be argued as a pro that the wax figures were so realistic-Expensive ($20 for only 20-30 minutes worth of stuff)-One interactive exhibit for Rosa Parks suggested we sit at the back of the bus, which seems to trivialize her experiences and the civil rights movement.Overall, while I recognize how cool it is that they are able to replicate people from the past and present so perfectly, I do not think I will be going back as it is too expensive for what it is.
Half the fun of visiting Madame Tussaud's is not knowing which wax characters you'll next encounter so my goal here is not to spoil things for you.  Instead, my goal is to tell you something you might not otherwise know.:1.  Many area libraries offer free museum tickets.  Did you know that those free tickets may also be offered for admission to Madame Tussaud's?  I was inspired to go solely because of the free pass offered by the Marin County Library system.  A woman in line in front of me was there with her free pass from the Alameda County library system.  The free passes are good for one adult and one child.  This is a great deal.  2.  You're going to want photos of yourself with the wax characters.  Really.  Madame Tussaud's makes this almost irresistible.  Their set-up is arranged to allow you to put yourself into iconic movie scenes, to become part of a political march, and the like.  There's even footprints on the ground in certain places to show you exactly where to stand.  So plan to take photos and if you're coming here solo, now's the time to invest in a selfie stick.3.  Madame Tussaud's didn't need to make the San Francisco version of their "museum" reflect San Francisco in any way, shape, or form.  That they did positively tickled me.  It would be a sad little wax museum if all they featured were San Francisco landmarks and San Francisco swells; they do a good job of balancing the SF-centric with images of people you care more about seeing.  4.  Some of these likenesses are better than others.  Some, of complete unknowns, I could appreciate for their realism alone.  As I stood 2 inches from the face of a couple of wax images I broke into laughter, so certain was I that the figure was about to break character and come alive.  When they're good, they're really good.  6.  It's time they retire a few figures and replace them with more relevant celebrities.  Get into the section featuring sports luminaries and tell me you don't agree.  5.  On-line tickets are available for $16 (advance purchase by Bay Area locals) to $22 (advance on-line purchase by non-locals).  I thought Madame Tussaud's was a fun, mindless activity but must admit that if I paid any more than $5 to get in my assessment of the experience would've lessened significantly.  Free tickets though?  You'll have fun.  There's one million things I would suggest tourists in San Francisco do before heading into Madame Tussaud's but if you get free tickets it actually makes for a great excuse to play tourist for the day.
Get your picture with Mr Clooney!We had received free admission since we purchased the 48 hr big bus tour pass.  I would've probably never purchased them since there is another location closer to home. This was my first time going through the famous Madam Tussaud's.  The wax figures are definitely very life like and almost freaky.  I was expecting one of the figures to come to life.  The tour begins showing the process and time that goes into creating the statues.  The museum is separated into different groups- presidents, celebs, singers and a few others.  Very organized.  Overall the tour is ok.  I'm hoping you can get these tickets with other tours you have booked.
The kids and the adults really enjoyed this wax museum!  Really well done and enjoyable.  Not only the special guests but the props and backdrops!  A great visit!
This place is absolutely amazing! I had so much fun it was ridiculous! They have plenty of props so that you can pose with the sculptures. I absolutely fell in love all over again with Beyoncé!!! I loved the Adele sculpture as well. They make her look so big on television but she is definitely an average size woman. I got to take a picture with Rosa Parks, Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., ET, Jimmy Hendrix and plenty more. The one that will forever be the most memorable was Robin Williams. I personally know the beast of depression so his story really means a lot to me!
Wow. My expectations were exceeded. We bought the double ticket to go through the dungeon as well and it was  so much fun. I was a little disappointed that the website advertizes some caracters, but they aren't on display. The dungeon tour was amazing. So realistic and interactive.Overall great experience!
I live an hr south of SF in Santa Clara and one weekend, my bf and I decided to do touristy stuff in the city. We purchased a Go Card (Which I highly reccomend for tourists who plans on visiting several tourist spots) which lets you enter several bay area attractions. Out of all the tours, I really didn't enjoy the wax museum that much. I mean it's okay but not amazing compared to other attractions like California Academy of Sciences. It's a hit and miss with the personalities and celebrity wax figures. I mean come on, Zendaya is not relevant. I wouldn't pay full price for it but since it came with my Go Card, it was ayt. I did enjoy Neil Patrick Harris, Obama, Beyonce to name a few. Oh and it was way warm inside btw.
Yeah, I think it's more of a 3 stars "A-OK", but I'll give it a 4 being nice... I don't know why I came here in San Francisco, when I haven't even gone to the one in Hollywood where I'm closer to... The Hollywood one seems like they got cooler stuff, like more super heroes and star figures. i heard they rotate a few figures around, but it felt like there wasn't much here... This was the first time I've been to a wax museum... I mean seeing a wax figure for the first time is pretty crazy... They really are so life-like, it's just freaky as hell... Morgan Freeman blew me away. lol it feels like it would come alive and move... I know actual celebrities have done pranks before where they actually pretend to be the figures and scare some visitors.... that's definitely a price of admission!!  At this day and age with selfies, this is a perfect goldmine photo op place for those things... I liked how they weren't strict and let you really take pictures freely. But there is one room where one of the staff will bug the hell of you to take photos for you with their camera... I can tell she was bored as hell and desperate to do her job... lol I'm sorry, but no thank you!! I went on a really dead day, so I guess the staff wasn't expecting seeing much people and they totally freaked out seeing me... LOL Do I look that scary??? Well, they told me it's weird seeing people moving when they're used to only seeing bunch of still wax figures around... I know that feeling, as I also felt a little freaked out too when I walked into a room and someone was moving -- after being used to the presence of the figures.So the San Francisco Madame Tussauds has the mayor figure and people relating to the city at the start. Some of the figures are really well done and look like the real person... others, not so much. Obama needs work. lol There's also Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg nearby. Alfred Hitchcock has the psycho shower and I think there's a sensor or randomly it screams and lights turn red... that was pretty cool.  I like that you can put on the props too like wear the jacket and everything and pose with E.T. The Bruce Lee one is really cool where you can stand as if he's about to kick your face. lol I like that one. That one definitely makes a fun photo opportunity. I don't care for One Direction... it should be Backstreet Boys or N'Sync. lol Some of the athletes, I don't understand... Why do we get Jeremy Lin with Lakers??!?! I want Michael Jordan!! lol If Beyonce's wax figure is like WHOAAAAA when you first see her... she must blow people away in real life... lol They put the good ones outside to attract people to come in... I mean, they got Leonardo DiCaprio standing right outside already... you can take photos with him without paying/going inside... Leo is taller than I thought! I parked in the public parking lot and I ended up having to pay like $20... ugh. They don't validate hereIt can be fun, especially if it's your first time seeing the wax figures and depending on who you go with... but I don't think it's really worth the price... it's a short experience. The Hollywood one seems superior, but it's probably way busier.
Madame Tussaud's is definitely a tourist attraction and a MUST see if you're lingering around Fishermans Wharf. I use to work at the Madame Tussauds in Hollywood and I visited the MT in New York City, Las Vegas and now San Francisco. Each attraction is different and caters to the city that they're in. Different photo ops, different rooms and props, they're all different but cohesive in a way that its true to who they are as an attraction in the city.San Francisco was definitely worth it and I enjoyed myself. Its a bit tiny but take advantage and take every photo you can with each figure. They had a Castro area where they had Harvey Milk just relaxing, when you first enter, you enter a sort of maze but it ended up being Lombard street (super cute). The workers there are fun and they always have a good time.We came in a lucky day because there was a Figure revealing!!! Which was reallly exciting because while working in the one in Hollywood they always had a figure revealing as a private event as suppose to a public event. Who did they reveal you ask? SAM SMITH. The man himself was there which was funny and cute. Definitely take a lot of pictures of each of the figures there because they're amazing to look at since its life size and their exact measurements, definitely my favorite would be Laverne Cox she is queen.One con about is that Magic Memories (Their photo department) can improve in their camera... Some pictures came out not as I expected because it looked really cheap... But I wanted to buy it anyways because it'll be a great souviner when I visit most of the Madame Tussuad's and their signiture signs and stuff. Ex; Vegas has the "Welcome to Vegas" Hollywood has the "Hollywood" sign, and New York has King Kong on the Empire State Building!!Definitely a 5 star worthy place!!! Visit if you love that creepy celebrity wax figure type of thing!!Have Fun and Good Luck!
Warrning this may be a long review. I went here last week. I will say this place is so much fun. I brought my son in because I wanted to take him out on a fun couple of days since there's been problems at school with him. Since the moment we walked in everyone had a warm welcoming smile. (For some reason I can't remember the girl who helped us with the tickets but she was African American) The only exception was this one small girl who didn't look happy to see us, but I wasn't going to let her mess with my experience here. The girl who helped us at the admissions was very sweet and explained everything about the museum. We finally went up stairs and we saw Robin Williams my heart stopped because I loved him I think I cried a little. My son learned about where I'm from since we're from Sparks, Nevada. He didn't know who Jerry Garcia was and it was so cool telling him about who he was and actually seeing him. So we kept walking around until we saw this little place called wax hands and we asked the girl what it was. She said her name was Livia. She explained how the process worked and my son and I wanted to do it. She was very inviting and very funny. When we asked her questions about the museum she knew the answer is right away. Which I liked. She told us that they had just gotten the Steph Curry which my son was so happy to hear. We finished the wax hands and went to see Curry now what they didn't tell us is that we could touch them the only one who told us that was Livia from wax hands. So my son just started hugging Steph and would not let go. Now I'm a big Elvis fan and he's statue was amazing every single detail was perfect I wish I could have taken it home. We walked threw the rest of the museum and was very impressed by it all. The Neil Patrick Harris statue was my favorite after the Elvis one. We were in there a good hour and a half and I enjoyed every bit of it. I would most definitely return to the museum and maybe get another wax hand with my husband. As well as show him the Marilyn Monroe as that's his dream gal. Highly recommend you coming here. Also going to the dungeon next door is a good hidden gem my son and I absolutely loved going to both.
This was much more fun than we anticipated! We honestly didn't know what to expect, but genuinely enjoyed the goofing around, selfies, and awe of the amount of work put into these figures. If you are "local" (part of the nine Bay Area counties) you can get significantly discounted tickets, just ask and show your ID!! They have other discounts for military, too, I believe.
Madame Tussauds in San Francisco is great for families. Thankfully, I received free passes to go and I was happy to check it out. It's been open for about 6 months in Fisherman's Wharf; previously, there was an independent wax museum located here. I had never been to that one, but I have been to original Madame Tussauds in London.The SF one is much much smaller. I took plenty of pictures, and I still think it only takes an hour to see it all. You could easily get out of there in 30 minutes or less though, if you didn't want to pose for pictures. The first floor has a couple of figures you can check out for free including, at the time, Michael Phelps, Johnny Depp, and Morgan Freeman, but I'm sure they move them around. Once paid, you head back to the elevator and you'll pass San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, surprisingly. Then you'll head up to the top floor where you'll work your way down. There's two floors of figures. Oddly, when you exit from the elevator, they immediately try to tell you that you've been upgraded to a VIP package and slap a wristband on you, which is all prepping you for a sales pitch at the end. Along your visit, a photographer will snap pictures of you with figures, so they can try to sell you a package at the end. I didn't care for this and the sleazy tactic of trying to pitch it to you like you were specially selected for an upgrade was ridiculous. I would have liked to have been left alone to explore the figures as I liked, not coerced into forced photos that I wasn't going to buy. By the way, the photo packages start at $35 I think. Yea...I don't think so...especially when admission is quite costly as well. Anyway, the figures are divided into sections like SF icons, musicians, politicians, historical icons, and Hollywood figures. It was pretty cool how they had some very SF figures like Janis Joplin posed in a '60s setting with a hippie VW bus complete with a campfire and tent. This was more than just a figure; it was a complete scene from history. There was also scenes from Haight Street and the Golden Gate Bridge. There's also props like guitars, drum sets, umbrellas, etc to use at some of the figures, so you can take some more interesting photos. The Alfred Hitchcock figure was pretty cool because they had the shower set up from Psycho and you can step behind the shower curtain and use the knife and reenact the scene. There's special effects lighting and music too. The immersive, interactive displays were pretty fun. Overall, I think the museum is a bit too small and too pricey. The one is London is much better. However, I liked that they tried to put an SF twist to the museum. If you can find some coupons, or get a price you'd be happy with, then I think it's worthwhile to go. It's pretty cool to see the dimensions and proportions of famous people. Also, if you look at the Yelp photos on here, you can see a lot of people aren't shy about copping a feel! Grab that hottie's wax booty or feel up the biseps of Obama! When else would you have the chance?
This place was pretty cool. The celebrity's look so real. Steph Curry even had facial stubble that looked so real. It was fun to take pictures next to all the figures. I visited with my friend we had a good time. Only thing is it is pricey i think $35 for entrance fee. We got a san Francisco GO card which was good for 27 attractions so i would suggest getting one of those to save money.
was okay but deff would not b worth the 35.00. But some of the peopld they had in there i didnt get like Laverne  Coxs really? And the girl ftom Disney  i frgt  her name  that was just strange but deff good to take pictures.  Deff better to get the go card
great place to spend kill 1-2 hours at Fisherman's Wharf! Even though this MT in San Francisco is much smaller compared to the one in Las Vegas or Los Angeles, it still is great and features many exquisite California geographic features and wax celebrities like the Beatles.Attractions like Madame Tussauds and The Dungeon (next door) are only great when you have got a groupon or some other great value saving coupon. So never pay full price for admission!!!
As part of our Big Bus San Francisco 48-hour Dynamite tour bus ticket, we were given passes to Madame Tussauds ($26 value each) as well.  Located at Fisherman's Wharf, we decided to walk through because, well why not?  It was already an included value so why waste a free ticket.  I've never been to a Madame Tussauds before but I did know what to expect.  Lifesized wax figurines of notable celebrities and exhibits.  Some are currently living, some are not.  The SF Madame Tussauds does have a lot of notable Northern California celebrities like Robin Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, and  Steve Jobs.  Others included are Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Neil Patrick Harris, the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Rosa Parks.  You're allowed to touch the exhibits and take photos.  It was a fun little break from all the walking we had been doing and cool to see how tall these celebrities really are.  We also posed on the ET bike in the red hoodie too.
This was my first time to visit a Madame Tussaud Wax Museum after hearing about it from other people.  This may not be as big as the other museums in the world, but was still pretty amusing.They have a figure of Santana, Jimmy Hendrix, Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Rhianna and other celebrities.  There is a green screen where they take a picture of your and your family (if not travelling alone) and to buy this photo is optional at the end of the tour.  There are 2 elevators that lead you up to 3rd floor. Santana, Hendrix, Mayor Lee and other notable celebrities such as Bob Marley, Tony Bennett, Madonna, Beyonce, Tupac, Michael Jackson and the old (and fatter) version of Adele just to name a few.2nd floor has Clooney, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Aniston, Elton John. At the end of this path, you come up to 2 elevators that bring you back downstairs where you have the choice to purchase the green-screen photo of your Madam Tussaud Souvenir.  This place is also attached to the "San Francisco Dungeon" attraction which happens to be next door.  If you want to be more thrilled and entertained, go next door and try that one too.  Overall, not bad for a first time trip to the museum with the family.  Hope to try the one in NY sometime this summer.
This place was fun! I came here with my boyfriend yesterday and it was creepy at first but the idea that it might be an actual person goes away after realizing how awesome everything is. I wish there were more wax figures there but overall it was fun to see.

I know actual celebrities have done pranks before where they actually pretend to be the figures and scare some visitors.... that's definitely a price of admission!!  At this day and age with selfies, this is a perfect goldmine photo op place for those things... I liked how they weren't strict and let you really take pictures freely. But there is one room where one of the staff will bug the hell of you to take photos for you with their camera... I can tell she was bored as hell and desperate to do her job... lol I'm sorry, but no thank you!! I went on a really dead day, so I guess the staff wasn't expecting seeing much people and they totally freaked out seeing me... LOL Do I look that scary??? Well, they told me it's weird seeing people moving when they're used to only seeing bunch of still wax figures around... I know that feeling, as I also felt a little freaked out too when I walked into a room and someone was moving -- after being used to the presence of the figures.So the San Francisco Madame Tussauds has the mayor figure and people relating to the city at the start. Some of the figures are really well done and look like the real person... others, not so much. Obama needs work. lol There's also Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg nearby. Alfred Hitchcock has the psycho shower and I think there's a sensor or randomly it screams and lights turn red... that was pretty cool.  I like that you can put on the props too like wear the jacket and everything and pose with E.T. The Bruce Lee one is really cool where you can stand as if he's about to kick your face. lol I like that one. That one definitely makes a fun photo opportunity. I don't care for One Direction... it should be Backstreet Boys or N'Sync. lol Some of the athletes, I don't understand... Why do we get Jeremy Lin with Lakers??!?! I want Michael Jordan!! lol If Beyonce's wax figure is like WHOAAAAA when you first see her... she must blow people away in real life... lol They put the good ones outside to attract people to come in... I mean, they got Leonardo DiCaprio standing right outside already... you can take photos with him without paying/going inside... Leo is taller than I thought! I parked in the public parking lot and I ended up having to pay like $20... ugh. They don't validate hereIt can be fun, especially if it's your first time seeing the wax figures and depending on who you go with... but I don't think it's really worth the price... it's a short experience. The Hollywood one seems superior, but it's probably way busier.
Madame Tussaud's is definitely a tourist attraction and a MUST see if you're lingering around Fishermans Wharf. I use to work at the Madame Tussauds in Hollywood and I visited the MT in New York City, Las Vegas and now San Francisco. Each attraction is different and caters to the city that they're in. Different photo ops, different rooms and props, they're all different but cohesive in a way that its true to who they are as an attraction in the city.San Francisco was definitely worth it and I enjoyed myself. Its a bit tiny but take advantage and take every photo you can with each figure. They had a Castro area where they had Harvey Milk just relaxing, when you first enter, you enter a sort of maze but it ended up being Lombard street (super cute). The workers there are fun and they always have a good time.We came in a lucky day because there was a Figure revealing!!! Which was reallly exciting because while working in the one in Hollywood they always had a figure revealing as a private event as suppose to a public event. Who did they reveal you ask? SAM SMITH. The man himself was there which was funny and cute. Definitely take a lot of pictures of each of the figures there because they're amazing to look at since its life size and their exact measurements, definitely my favorite would be Laverne Cox she is queen.One con about is that Magic Memories (Their photo department) can improve in their camera... Some pictures came out not as I expected because it looked really cheap... But I wanted to buy it anyways because it'll be a great souviner when I visit most of the Madame Tussuad's and their signiture signs and stuff. Ex; Vegas has the "Welcome to Vegas" Hollywood has the "Hollywood" sign, and New York has King Kong on the Empire State Building!!Definitely a 5 star worthy place!!! Visit if you love that creepy celebrity wax figure type of thing!!Have Fun and Good Luck!
Warrning this may be a long review. I went here last week. I will say this place is so much fun. I brought my son in because I wanted to take him out on a fun couple of days since there's been problems at school with him. Since the moment we walked in everyone had a warm welcoming smile. (For some reason I can't remember the girl who helped us with the tickets but she was African American) The only exception was this one small girl who didn't look happy to see us, but I wasn't going to let her mess with my experience here. The girl who helped us at the admissions was very sweet and explained everything about the museum. We finally went up stairs and we saw Robin Williams my heart stopped because I loved him I think I cried a little. My son learned about where I'm from since we're from Sparks, Nevada. He didn't know who Jerry Garcia was and it was so cool telling him about who he was and actually seeing him. So we kept walking around until we saw this little place called wax hands and we asked the girl what it was. She said her name was Livia. She explained how the process worked and my son and I wanted to do it. She was very inviting and very funny. When we asked her questions about the museum she knew the answer is right away. Which I liked. She told us that they had just gotten the Steph Curry which my son was so happy to hear. We finished the wax hands and went to see Curry now what they didn't tell us is that we could touch them the only one who told us that was Livia from wax hands. So my son just started hugging Steph and would not let go. Now I'm a big Elvis fan and he's statue was amazing every single detail was perfect I wish I could have taken it home. We walked threw the rest of the museum and was very impressed by it all. The Neil Patrick Harris statue was my favorite after the Elvis one. We were in there a good hour and a half and I enjoyed every bit of it. I would most definitely return to the museum and maybe get another wax hand with my husband. As well as show him the Marilyn Monroe as that's his dream gal. Highly recommend you coming here. Also going to the dungeon next door is a good hidden gem my son and I absolutely loved going to both.
This was much more fun than we anticipated! We honestly didn't know what to expect, but genuinely enjoyed the goofing around, selfies, and awe of the amount of work put into these figures. If you are "local" (part of the nine Bay Area counties) you can get significantly discounted tickets, just ask and show your ID!! They have other discounts for military, too, I believe.
Madame Tussauds in San Francisco is great for families. Thankfully, I received free passes to go and I was happy to check it out. It's been open for about 6 months in Fisherman's Wharf; previously, there was an independent wax museum located here. I had never been to that one, but I have been to original Madame Tussauds in London.The SF one is much much smaller. I took plenty of pictures, and I still think it only takes an hour to see it all. You could easily get out of there in 30 minutes or less though, if you didn't want to pose for pictures. The first floor has a couple of figures you can check out for free including, at the time, Michael Phelps, Johnny Depp, and Morgan Freeman, but I'm sure they move them around. Once paid, you head back to the elevator and you'll pass San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, surprisingly. Then you'll head up to the top floor where you'll work your way down. There's two floors of figures. Oddly, when you exit from the elevator, they immediately try to tell you that you've been upgraded to a VIP package and slap a wristband on you, which is all prepping you for a sales pitch at the end. Along your visit, a photographer will snap pictures of you with figures, so they can try to sell you a package at the end. I didn't care for this and the sleazy tactic of trying to pitch it to you like you were specially selected for an upgrade was ridiculous. I would have liked to have been left alone to explore the figures as I liked, not coerced into forced photos that I wasn't going to buy. By the way, the photo packages start at $35 I think. Yea...I don't think so...especially when admission is quite costly as well. Anyway, the figures are divided into sections like SF icons, musicians, politicians, historical icons, and Hollywood figures. It was pretty cool how they had some very SF figures like Janis Joplin posed in a '60s setting with a hippie VW bus complete with a campfire and tent. This was more than just a figure; it was a complete scene from history. There was also scenes from Haight Street and the Golden Gate Bridge. There's also props like guitars, drum sets, umbrellas, etc to use at some of the figures, so you can take some more interesting photos. The Alfred Hitchcock figure was pretty cool because they had the shower set up from Psycho and you can step behind the shower curtain and use the knife and reenact the scene. There's special effects lighting and music too. The immersive, interactive displays were pretty fun. Overall, I think the museum is a bit too small and too pricey. The one is London is much better. However, I liked that they tried to put an SF twist to the museum. If you can find some coupons, or get a price you'd be happy with, then I think it's worthwhile to go. It's pretty cool to see the dimensions and proportions of famous people. Also, if you look at the Yelp photos on here, you can see a lot of people aren't shy about copping a feel! Grab that hottie's wax booty or feel up the biseps of Obama! When else would you have the chance?
This place was pretty cool. The celebrity's look so real. Steph Curry even had facial stubble that looked so real. It was fun to take pictures next to all the figures. I visited with my friend we had a good time. Only thing is it is pricey i think $35 for entrance fee. We got a san Francisco GO card which was good for 27 attractions so i would suggest getting one of those to save money.
was okay but deff would not b worth the 35.00. But some of the peopld they had in there i didnt get like Laverne  Coxs really? And the girl ftom Disney  i frgt  her name  that was just strange but deff good to take pictures.  Deff better to get the go card
great place to spend kill 1-2 hours at Fisherman's Wharf! Even though this MT in San Francisco is much smaller compared to the one in Las Vegas or Los Angeles, it still is great and features many exquisite California geographic features and wax celebrities like the Beatles.Attractions like Madame Tussauds and The Dungeon (next door) are only great when you have got a groupon or some other great value saving coupon. So never pay full price for admission!!!
As part of our Big Bus San Francisco 48-hour Dynamite tour bus ticket, we were given passes to Madame Tussauds ($26 value each) as well.  Located at Fisherman's Wharf, we decided to walk through because, well why not?  It was already an included value so why waste a free ticket.  I've never been to a Madame Tussauds before but I did know what to expect.  Lifesized wax figurines of notable celebrities and exhibits.  Some are currently living, some are not.  The SF Madame Tussauds does have a lot of notable Northern California celebrities like Robin Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, and  Steve Jobs.  Others included are Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Neil Patrick Harris, the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Rosa Parks.  You're allowed to touch the exhibits and take photos.  It was a fun little break from all the walking we had been doing and cool to see how tall these celebrities really are.  We also posed on the ET bike in the red hoodie too.
This was my first time to visit a Madame Tussaud Wax Museum after hearing about it from other people.  This may not be as big as the other museums in the world, but was still pretty amusing.They have a figure of Santana, Jimmy Hendrix, Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Rhianna and other celebrities.  There is a green screen where they take a picture of your and your family (if not travelling alone) and to buy this photo is optional at the end of the tour.  There are 2 elevators that lead you up to 3rd floor. Santana, Hendrix, Mayor Lee and other notable celebrities such as Bob Marley, Tony Bennett, Madonna, Beyonce, Tupac, Michael Jackson and the old (and fatter) version of Adele just to name a few.2nd floor has Clooney, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Aniston, Elton John. At the end of this path, you come up to 2 elevators that bring you back downstairs where you have the choice to purchase the green-screen photo of your Madam Tussaud Souvenir.  This place is also attached to the "San Francisco Dungeon" attraction which happens to be next door.  If you want to be more thrilled and entertained, go next door and try that one too.  Overall, not bad for a first time trip to the museum with the family.  Hope to try the one in NY sometime this summer.
This place was fun! I came here with my boyfriend yesterday and it was creepy at first but the idea that it might be an actual person goes away after realizing how awesome everything is. I wish there were more wax figures there but overall it was fun to see.
This place is AMAZINGStephen Curry? Peter Dinklage?My eyes went wild just walking around this place. It's too much excitement to take in all at once!The wax figures all look so real. Especially the beard on some of the figures like Peter Dinklage. Up close, it looked so real it's crazy. Plus they let me touch the figures, which actually felt kind of real and pretty neat. It's hard to describe the feeling unless you're there.I liked the singer room the most. Being surrounded by standing figures of Rihanna, Beyonce, Madonna, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Aniston, and Adele at the same time felt surreal. You can see the life-size height, the body, the facial expression. It's as close to meeting them as I will ever get in this life time :) Ever harder to get all of them in the same room.2Pac was there too. I thought he was dead!I knew Obama is really tall. Did you know Steve Jobs is actually a bit taller? I did not know that. Christian Bale is really tall in real life too--it was hard to tell since he is also quite buff in the Batman movies.The exhibit was also very much San-Francisco-themed, with some areas decorated after Lombard Street, Golden Gate, and Cafe Zoetrope where they made the Godfather. Great for bringing friends from out-of-town, especially when passing by Fisherman's Wharf.Overall, a really GREAT place to visit. Definitely have to check out this place. I know I'll be going back again and again with friends and family.
Creepy but fun!I enjoyed seeing these life-like wax figures and get up close and personal with Hollywood favorite celebrities, sports and historical wax figures. It's probably as close as I can get to the real star. This location in San Francisco opened in June 2014 so it's fairly new? Our visit here wasn't planned, it was a spur of the moment idea and the cheapest rate we could find was through the Madame Tussaud's website and purchased the tickets online at $19.75 + fees/adult ($16 if you live within the 9 local Bay Area counties).This location had less wax figures compared to the other Madame Tussaud's I've visited in the past (London UK and Las Vegas NV), but still I enjoyed visiting each figure and reading their little captions and their stories. San Francisco had figures that is part of San Francisco's history -- Al Capone (imprisoned in Alcatraz), Harvey Milk (gay rights activist), Janis Joplin (who lived down Haight, Ashbury area of San Francisco}, Robin Williams who lived in Tiburon, Francis Ford Coppola (film maker and owns two prominent wineries in Northern CA), Edwin Lee (first Asian-American Mayor in SF's history), Joseph Strauss (chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge and it wouldn't be complete if there were no wax figure representing the California Gold Rush, enter John Sutter. The wax displays were in sections-- movie celebrities, music artists, sports figures and historical figures (presidents and activists, etc).  So as I walked along and checked out each wax display I became co-director with Steven Spielberg, I flew E.T. home, I played ball with NBA's Stephan Curry (#30 Golden State Warriors), I sat next to George Clooney, I hitchhiked with Robin Williams along Lombard Street, I caught up with Christian Bale before he starts fighting crime in Gotham City, I took a mug shot near Al Capone's prison cell, had tea with Audrey Hepburn at Tiffany's, made an Uma Thurman dance move with John Travolta (Pulp Fiction), walked along the London streets with the Fab Four "Beatles", and sat on the bench with the Comeback Kid #16 (guess?).  These were just a few of the wax figure displays here in the San Francisco location.There were props available for fun photo ops and you can show off your selfie in Instagram, Facebook and Twitter at #MTSFselfie.  This made for a fun afternoon. Hope they add more celebrity figures in the future. Funny how the museum had a wax of Selena Gomez and not Justin Beiber... just saying.
I was able to visit Madame Tussauds because I got a free ticket with my Big Bus Tour. While it was enjoyable and interesting, I am glad that I did not have to pay as I don't believe it is entirely worth $20-30.PROS:-Interactive exhibits (e.g. "Gay Pride" posters to hold near Castro district)-Informative San Francisco history exhibits-Interesting exhibit displaying how wax figures are made-Nice staffCONS:-Underwhelming amount of wax figures-Slightly scary (for my girlfriend) - although it could be argued as a pro that the wax figures were so realistic-Expensive ($20 for only 20-30 minutes worth of stuff)-One interactive exhibit for Rosa Parks suggested we sit at the back of the bus, which seems to trivialize her experiences and the civil rights movement.Overall, while I recognize how cool it is that they are able to replicate people from the past and present so perfectly, I do not think I will be going back as it is too expensive for what it is.
Half the fun of visiting Madame Tussaud's is not knowing which wax characters you'll next encounter so my goal here is not to spoil things for you.  Instead, my goal is to tell you something you might not otherwise know.:1.  Many area libraries offer free museum tickets.  Did you know that those free tickets may also be offered for admission to Madame Tussaud's?  I was inspired to go solely because of the free pass offered by the Marin County Library system.  A woman in line in front of me was there with her free pass from the Alameda County library system.  The free passes are good for one adult and one child.  This is a great deal.  2.  You're going to want photos of yourself with the wax characters.  Really.  Madame Tussaud's makes this almost irresistible.  Their set-up is arranged to allow you to put yourself into iconic movie scenes, to become part of a political march, and the like.  There's even footprints on the ground in certain places to show you exactly where to stand.  So plan to take photos and if you're coming here solo, now's the time to invest in a selfie stick.3.  Madame Tussaud's didn't need to make the San Francisco version of their "museum" reflect San Francisco in any way, shape, or form.  That they did positively tickled me.  It would be a sad little wax museum if all they featured were San Francisco landmarks and San Francisco swells; they do a good job of balancing the SF-centric with images of people you care more about seeing.  4.  Some of these likenesses are better than others.  Some, of complete unknowns, I could appreciate for their realism alone.  As I stood 2 inches from the face of a couple of wax images I broke into laughter, so certain was I that the figure was about to break character and come alive.  When they're good, they're really good.  6.  It's time they retire a few figures and replace them with more relevant celebrities.  Get into the section featuring sports luminaries and tell me you don't agree.  5.  On-line tickets are available for $16 (advance purchase by Bay Area locals) to $22 (advance on-line purchase by non-locals).  I thought Madame Tussaud's was a fun, mindless activity but must admit that if I paid any more than $5 to get in my assessment of the experience would've lessened significantly.  Free tickets though?  You'll have fun.  There's one million things I would suggest tourists in San Francisco do before heading into Madame Tussaud's but if you get free tickets it actually makes for a great excuse to play tourist for the day.
Get your picture with Mr Clooney!We had received free admission since we purchased the 48 hr big bus tour pass.  I would've probably never purchased them since there is another location closer to home. This was my first time going through the famous Madam Tussaud's.  The wax figures are definitely very life like and almost freaky.  I was expecting one of the figures to come to life.  The tour begins showing the process and time that goes into creating the statues.  The museum is separated into different groups- presidents, celebs, singers and a few others.  Very organized.  Overall the tour is ok.  I'm hoping you can get these tickets with other tours you have booked.
The kids and the adults really enjoyed this wax museum!  Really well done and enjoyable.  Not only the special guests but the props and backdrops!  A great visit!
This place is absolutely amazing! I had so much fun it was ridiculous! They have plenty of props so that you can pose with the sculptures. I absolutely fell in love all over again with Beyoncé!!! I loved the Adele sculpture as well. They make her look so big on television but she is definitely an average size woman. I got to take a picture with Rosa Parks, Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., ET, Jimmy Hendrix and plenty more. The one that will forever be the most memorable was Robin Williams. I personally know the beast of depression so his story really means a lot to me!
Wow. My expectations were exceeded. We bought the double ticket to go through the dungeon as well and it was  so much fun. I was a little disappointed that the website advertizes some caracters, but they aren't on display. The dungeon tour was amazing. So realistic and interactive.Overall great experience!
I live an hr south of SF in Santa Clara and one weekend, my bf and I decided to do touristy stuff in the city. We purchased a Go Card (Which I highly reccomend for tourists who plans on visiting several tourist spots) which lets you enter several bay area attractions. Out of all the tours, I really didn't enjoy the wax museum that much. I mean it's okay but not amazing compared to other attractions like California Academy of Sciences. It's a hit and miss with the personalities and celebrity wax figures. I mean come on, Zendaya is not relevant. I wouldn't pay full price for it but since it came with my Go Card, it was ayt. I did enjoy Neil Patrick Harris, Obama, Beyonce to name a few. Oh and it was way warm inside btw.
Yeah, I think it's more of a 3 stars "A-OK", but I'll give it a 4 being nice... I don't know why I came here in San Francisco, when I haven't even gone to the one in Hollywood where I'm closer to... The Hollywood one seems like they got cooler stuff, like more super heroes and star figures. i heard they rotate a few figures around, but it felt like there wasn't much here... This was the first time I've been to a wax museum... I mean seeing a wax figure for the first time is pretty crazy... They really are so life-like, it's just freaky as hell... Morgan Freeman blew me away. lol it feels like it would come alive and move... I know actual celebrities have done pranks before where they actually pretend to be the figures and scare some visitors.... that's definitely a price of admission!!  At this day and age with selfies, this is a perfect goldmine photo op place for those things... I liked how they weren't strict and let you really take pictures freely. But there is one room where one of the staff will bug the hell of you to take photos for you with their camera... I can tell she was bored as hell and desperate to do her job... lol I'm sorry, but no thank you!! I went on a really dead day, so I guess the staff wasn't expecting seeing much people and they totally freaked out seeing me... LOL Do I look that scary??? Well, they told me it's weird seeing people moving when they're used to only seeing bunch of still wax figures around... I know that feeling, as I also felt a little freaked out too when I walked into a room and someone was moving -- after being used to the presence of the figures.So the San Francisco Madame Tussauds has the mayor figure and people relating to the city at the start.

I want Michael Jordan!! lol If Beyonce's wax figure is like WHOAAAAA when you first see her... she must blow people away in real life... lol They put the good ones outside to attract people to come in... I mean, they got Leonardo DiCaprio standing right outside already... you can take photos with him without paying/going inside... Leo is taller than I thought!

I visited with my friend we had a good time. Only thing is it is pricey i think $35 for entrance fee. We got a san Francisco GO card which was good for 27 attractions so i would suggest getting one of those to save money.
was okay but deff would not b worth the 35.00. But some of the peopld they had in there i didnt get like Laverne  Coxs really? And the girl ftom Disney  i frgt  her name  that was just strange but deff good to take pictures.  Deff better to get the go card
great place to spend kill 1-2 hours at Fisherman's Wharf! Even though this MT in San Francisco is much smaller compared to the one in Las Vegas or Los Angeles, it still is great and features many exquisite California geographic features and wax celebrities like the Beatles.Attractions like Madame Tussauds and The Dungeon (next door) are only great when you have got a groupon or some other great value saving coupon. So never pay full price for admission!!!
As part of our Big Bus San Francisco 48-hour Dynamite tour bus ticket, we were given passes to Madame Tussauds ($26 value each) as well.  Located at Fisherman's Wharf, we decided to walk through because, well why not?  It was already an included value so why waste a free ticket.  I've never been to a Madame Tussauds before but I did know what to expect.  Lifesized wax figurines of notable celebrities and exhibits.  Some are currently living, some are not.  The SF Madame Tussauds does have a lot of notable Northern California celebrities like Robin Williams, Mark Zuckerberg, and  Steve Jobs.  Others included are Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Neil Patrick Harris, the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Rosa Parks.  You're allowed to touch the exhibits and take photos.  It was a fun little break from all the walking we had been doing and cool to see how tall these celebrities really are.  We also posed on the ET bike in the red hoodie too.
This was my first time to visit a Madame Tussaud Wax Museum after hearing about it from other people.  This may not be as big as the other museums in the world, but was still pretty amusing.They have a figure of Santana, Jimmy Hendrix, Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Rhianna and other celebrities.  There is a green screen where they take a picture of your and your family (if not travelling alone) and to buy this photo is optional at the end of the tour.  There are 2 elevators that lead you up to 3rd floor. Santana, Hendrix, Mayor Lee and other notable celebrities such as Bob Marley, Tony Bennett, Madonna, Beyonce, Tupac, Michael Jackson and the old (and fatter) version of Adele just to name a few.2nd floor has Clooney, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Aniston, Elton John. At the end of this path, you come up to 2 elevators that bring you back downstairs where you have the choice to purchase the green-screen photo of your Madam Tussaud Souvenir.  This place is also attached to the "San Francisco Dungeon" attraction which happens to be next door.  If you want to be more thrilled and entertained, go next door and try that one too.  Overall, not bad for a first time trip to the museum with the family.  Hope to try the one in NY sometime this summer.
This place was fun! I came here with my boyfriend yesterday and it was creepy at first but the idea that it might be an actual person goes away after realizing how awesome everything is. I wish there were more wax figures there but overall it was fun to see.
This place is AMAZINGStephen Curry? Peter Dinklage?My eyes went wild just walking around this place. It's too much excitement to take in all at once!The wax figures all look so real. Especially the beard on some of the figures like Peter Dinklage. Up close, it looked so real it's crazy. Plus they let me touch the figures, which actually felt kind of real and pretty neat. It's hard to describe the feeling unless you're there.I liked the singer room the most. Being surrounded by standing figures of Rihanna, Beyonce, Madonna, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Aniston, and Adele at the same time felt surreal. You can see the life-size height, the body, the facial expression. It's as close to meeting them as I will ever get in this life time :) Ever harder to get all of them in the same room.2Pac was there too. I thought he was dead!I knew Obama is really tall. Did you know Steve Jobs is actually a bit taller? I did not know that. Christian Bale is really tall in real life too--it was hard to tell since he is also quite buff in the Batman movies.The exhibit was also very much San-Francisco-themed, with some areas decorated after Lombard Street, Golden Gate, and Cafe Zoetrope where they made the Godfather. Great for bringing friends from out-of-town, especially when passing by Fisherman's Wharf.Overall, a really GREAT place to visit. Definitely have to check out this place. I know I'll be going back again and again with friends and family.
Creepy but fun!I enjoyed seeing these life-like wax figures and get up close and personal with Hollywood favorite celebrities, sports and historical wax figures. It's probably as close as I can get to the real star. This location in San Francisco opened in June 2014 so it's fairly new? Our visit here wasn't planned, it was a spur of the moment idea and the cheapest rate we could find was through the Madame Tussaud's website and purchased the tickets online at $19.75 + fees/adult ($16 if you live within the 9 local Bay Area counties).This location had less wax figures compared to the other Madame Tussaud's I've visited in the past (London UK and Las Vegas NV), but still I enjoyed visiting each figure and reading their little captions and their stories. San Francisco had figures that is part of San Francisco's history -- Al Capone (imprisoned in Alcatraz), Harvey Milk (gay rights activist), Janis Joplin (who lived down Haight, Ashbury area of San Francisco}, Robin Williams who lived in Tiburon, Francis Ford Coppola (film maker and owns two prominent wineries in Northern CA), Edwin Lee (first Asian-American Mayor in SF's history), Joseph Strauss (chief engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge and it wouldn't be complete if there were no wax figure representing the California Gold Rush, enter John Sutter. The wax displays were in sections-- movie celebrities, music artists, sports figures and historical figures (presidents and activists, etc).  So as I walked along and checked out each wax display I became co-director with Steven Spielberg, I flew E.T. home, I played ball with NBA's Stephan Curry (#30 Golden State Warriors), I sat next to George Clooney, I hitchhiked with Robin Williams along Lombard Street, I caught up with Christian Bale before he starts fighting crime in Gotham City, I took a mug shot near Al Capone's prison cell, had tea with Audrey Hepburn at Tiffany's, made an Uma Thurman dance move with John Travolta (Pulp Fiction), walked along the London streets with the Fab Four "Beatles", and sat on the bench with the Comeback Kid #16 (guess?).  These were just a few of the wax figure displays here in the San Francisco location.There were props available for fun photo ops and you can show off your selfie in Instagram, Facebook and Twitter at #MTSFselfie.  This made for a fun afternoon. Hope they add more celebrity figures in the future. Funny how the museum had a wax of Selena Gomez and not Justin Beiber... just saying.
I was able to visit Madame Tussauds because I got a free ticket with my Big Bus Tour. While it was enjoyable and interesting, I am glad that I did not have to pay as I don't believe it is entirely worth $20-30.PROS:-Interactive exhibits (e.g. "Gay Pride" posters to hold near Castro district)-Informative San Francisco history exhibits-Interesting exhibit displaying how wax figures are made-Nice staffCONS:-Underwhelming amount of wax figures-Slightly scary (for my girlfriend) - although it could be argued as a pro that the wax figures were so realistic-Expensive ($20 for only 20-30 minutes worth of stuff)-One interactive exhibit for Rosa Parks suggested we sit at the back of the bus, which seems to trivialize her experiences and the civil rights movement.Overall, while I recognize how cool it is that they are able to replicate people from the past and present so perfectly, I do not think I will be going back as it is too expensive for what it is.
Half the fun of visiting Madame Tussaud's is not knowing which wax characters you'll next encounter so my goal here is not to spoil things for you.  Instead, my goal is to tell you something you might not otherwise know.:1.  Many area libraries offer free museum tickets.  Did you know that those free tickets may also be offered for admission to Madame Tussaud's?  I was inspired to go solely because of the free pass offered by the Marin County Library system.  A woman in line in front of me was there with her free pass from the Alameda County library system.  The free passes are good for one adult and one child.  This is a great deal.  2.  You're going to want photos of yourself with the wax characters.  Really.  Madame Tussaud's makes this almost irresistible.  Their set-up is arranged to allow you to put yourself into iconic movie scenes, to become part of a political march, and the like.  There's even footprints on the ground in certain places to show you exactly where to stand.  So plan to take photos and if you're coming here solo, now's the time to invest in a selfie stick.3.  Madame Tussaud's didn't need to make the San Francisco version of their "museum" reflect San Francisco in any way, shape, or form.  That they did positively tickled me.  It would be a sad little wax museum if all they featured were San Francisco landmarks and San Francisco swells; they do a good job of balancing the SF-centric with images of people you care more about seeing.  4.  Some of these likenesses are better than others.  Some, of complete unknowns, I could appreciate for their realism alone.  As I stood 2 inches from the face of a couple of wax images I broke into laughter, so certain was I that the figure was about to break character and come alive.  When they're good, they're really good.  6.  It's time they retire a few figures and replace them with more relevant celebrities.  Get into the section featuring sports luminaries and tell me you don't agree.  5.  On-line tickets are available for $16 (advance purchase by Bay Area locals) to $22 (advance on-line purchase by non-locals).  I thought Madame Tussaud's was a fun, mindless activity but must admit that if I paid any more than $5 to get in my assessment of the experience would've lessened significantly.  Free tickets though?  You'll have fun.  There's one million things I would suggest tourists in San Francisco do before heading into Madame Tussaud's but if you get free tickets it actually makes for a great excuse to play tourist for the day.
Get your picture with Mr Clooney!We had received free admission since we purchased the 48 hr big bus tour pass.  I would've probably never purchased them since there is another location closer to home. This was my first time going through the famous Madam Tussaud's.  The wax figures are definitely very life like and almost freaky.  I was expecting one of the figures to come to life.  The tour begins showing the process and time that goes into creating the statues.  The museum is separated into different groups- presidents, celebs, singers and a few others.  Very organized.  Overall the tour is ok.  I'm hoping you can get these tickets with other tours you have booked.
The kids and the adults really enjoyed this wax museum!  Really well done and enjoyable.  Not only the special guests but the props and backdrops!  A great visit!
This place is absolutely amazing! I had so much fun it was ridiculous! They have plenty of props so that you can pose with the sculptures. I absolutely fell in love all over again with Beyoncé!!! I loved the Adele sculpture as well. They make her look so big on television but she is definitely an average size woman. I got to take a picture with Rosa Parks, Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., ET, Jimmy Hendrix and plenty more. The one that will forever be the most memorable was Robin Williams. I personally know the beast of depression so his story really means a lot to me!
Wow. My expectations were exceeded. We bought the double ticket to go through the dungeon as well and it was  so much fun. I was a little disappointed that the website advertizes some caracters, but they aren't on display. The dungeon tour was amazing. So realistic and interactive.Overall great experience!
I live an hr south of SF in Santa Clara and one weekend, my bf and I decided to do touristy stuff in the city. We purchased a Go Card (Which I highly reccomend for tourists who plans on visiting several tourist spots) which lets you enter several bay area attractions. Out of all the tours, I really didn't enjoy the wax museum that much. I mean it's okay but not amazing compared to other attractions like California Academy of Sciences. It's a hit and miss with the personalities and celebrity wax figures. I mean come on, Zendaya is not relevant. I wouldn't pay full price for it but since it came with my Go Card, it was ayt. I did enjoy Neil Patrick Harris, Obama, Beyonce to name a few. Oh and it was way warm inside btw.
Yeah, I think it's more of a 3 stars "A-OK", but I'll give it a 4 being nice... I don't know why I came here in San Francisco, when I haven't even gone to the one in Hollywood where I'm closer to... The Hollywood one seems like they got cooler stuff, like more super heroes and star figures. i heard they rotate a few figures around, but it felt like there wasn't much here... This was the first time I've been to a wax museum... I mean seeing a wax figure for the first time is pretty crazy... They really are so life-like, it's just freaky as hell... Morgan Freeman blew me away. lol it feels like it would come alive and move... I know actual celebrities have done pranks before where they actually pretend to be the figures and scare some visitors.... that's definitely a price of admission!!  At this day and age with selfies, this is a perfect goldmine photo op place for those things... I liked how they weren't strict and let you really take pictures freely. But there is one room where one of the staff will bug the hell of you to take photos for you with their camera... I can tell she was bored as hell and desperate to do her job... lol I'm sorry, but no thank you!! I went on a really dead day, so I guess the staff wasn't expecting seeing much people and they totally freaked out seeing me... LOL Do I look that scary??? Well, they told me it's weird seeing people moving when they're used to only seeing bunch of still wax figures around... I know that feeling, as I also felt a little freaked out too when I walked into a room and someone was moving -- after being used to the presence of the figures.So the San Francisco Madame Tussauds has the mayor figure and people relating to the city at the start. Some of the figures are really well done and look like the real person... others, not so much. Obama needs work. lol There's also Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg nearby. Alfred Hitchcock has the psycho shower and I think there's a sensor or randomly it screams and lights turn red... that was pretty cool.  I like that you can put on the props too like wear the jacket and everything and pose with E.T. The Bruce Lee one is really cool where you can stand as if he's about to kick your face. lol I like that one. That one definitely makes a fun photo opportunity. I don't care for One Direction... it should be Backstreet Boys or N'Sync. lol Some of the athletes, I don't understand... Why do we get Jeremy Lin with Lakers??!?! I want Michael Jordan!! lol If Beyonce's wax figure is like WHOAAAAA when you first see her... she must blow people away in real life... lol They put the good ones outside to attract people to come in... I mean, they got Leonardo DiCaprio standing right outside already... you can take photos with him without paying/going inside... Leo is taller than I thought! I parked in the public parking lot and I ended up having to pay like $20... ugh. They don't validate hereIt can be fun, especially if it's your first time seeing the wax figures and depending on who you go with... but I don't think it's really worth the price... it's a short experience. The Hollywood one seems superior, but it's probably way busier.
Madame Tussaud's is definitely a tourist attraction and a MUST see if you're lingering around Fishermans Wharf. I use to work at the Madame Tussauds in Hollywood and I visited the MT in New York City, Las Vegas and now San Francisco. Each attraction is different and caters to the city that they're in. Different photo ops, different rooms and props, they're all different but cohesive in a way that its true to who they are as an attraction in the city.San Francisco was definitely worth it and I enjoyed myself. Its a bit tiny but take advantage and take every photo you can with each figure. They had a Castro area where they had Harvey Milk just relaxing, when you first enter, you enter a sort of maze but it ended up being Lombard street (super cute). The workers there are fun and they always have a good time.We came in a lucky day because there was a Figure revealing!!! Which was reallly exciting because while working in the one in Hollywood they always had a figure revealing as a private event as suppose to a public event. Who did they reveal you ask? SAM SMITH. The man himself was there which was funny and cute. Definitely take a lot of pictures of each of the figures there because they're amazing to look at since its life size and their exact measurements, definitely my favorite would be Laverne Cox she is queen.One con about is that Magic Memories (Their photo department) can improve in their camera... Some pictures came out not as I expected because it looked really cheap... But I wanted to buy it anyways because it'll be a great souviner when I visit most of the Madame Tussuad's and their signiture signs and stuff. Ex; Vegas has the "Welcome to Vegas" Hollywood has the "Hollywood" sign, and New York has King Kong on the Empire State Building!!Definitely a 5 star worthy place!!! Visit if you love that creepy celebrity wax figure type of thing!!Have Fun and Good Luck!
Warrning this may be a long review. I went here last week. I will say this place is so much fun. I brought my son in because I wanted to take him out on a fun couple of days since there's been problems at school with him. Since the moment we walked in everyone had a warm welcoming smile. (For some reason I can't remember the girl who helped us with the tickets but she was African American) The only exception was this one small girl who didn't look happy to see us, but I wasn't going to let her mess with my experience here. The girl who helped us at the admissions was very sweet and explained everything about the museum. We finally went up stairs and we saw Robin Williams my heart stopped because I loved him I think I cried a little. My son learned about where I'm from since we're from Sparks, Nevada. He didn't know who Jerry Garcia was and it was so cool telling him about who he was and actually seeing him. So we kept walking around until we saw this little place called wax hands and we asked the girl what it was. She said her name was Livia. She explained how the process worked and my son and I wanted to do it. She was very inviting and very funny. When we asked her questions about the museum she knew the answer is right away. Which I liked. She told us that they had just gotten the Steph Curry which my son was so happy to hear. We finished the wax hands and went to see Curry now what they didn't tell us is that we could touch them the only one who told us that was Livia from wax hands. So my son just started hugging Steph and would not let go. Now I'm a big Elvis fan and he's statue was amazing every single detail was perfect I wish I could have taken it home. We walked threw the rest of the museum and was very impressed by it all. The Neil Patrick Harris statue was my favorite after the Elvis one. We were in there a good hour and a half and I enjoyed every bit of it. I would most definitely return to the museum and maybe get another wax hand with my husband. As well as show him the Marilyn Monroe as that's his dream gal. Highly recommend you coming here. Also going to the dungeon next door is a good hidden gem my son and I absolutely loved going to both.
This was much more fun than we anticipated! We honestly didn't know what to expect, but genuinely enjoyed the goofing around, selfies, and awe of the amount of work put into these figures. If you are "local" (part of the nine Bay Area counties) you can get significantly discounted tickets, just ask and show your ID!! They have other discounts for military, too, I believe.
Madame Tussauds in San Francisco is great for families. Thankfully, I received free passes to go and I was happy to check it out. It's been open for about 6 months in Fisherman's Wharf; previously, there was an independent wax museum located here. I had never been to that one, but I have been to original Madame Tussauds in London.The SF one is much much smaller. I took plenty of pictures, and I still think it only takes an hour to see it all. You could easily get out of there in 30 minutes or less though, if you didn't want to pose for pictures. The first floor has a couple of figures you can check out for free including, at the time, Michael Phelps, Johnny Depp, and Morgan Freeman, but I'm sure they move them around. Once paid, you head back to the elevator and you'll pass San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, surprisingly. Then you'll head up to the top floor where you'll work your way down. There's two floors of figures. Oddly, when you exit from the elevator, they immediately try to tell you that you've been upgraded to a VIP package and slap a wristband on you, which is all prepping you for a sales pitch at the end. Along your visit, a photographer will snap pictures of you with figures, so they can try to sell you a package at the end. I didn't care for this and the sleazy tactic of trying to pitch it to you like you were specially selected for an upgrade was ridiculous. I would have liked to have been left alone to explore the figures as I liked, not coerced into forced photos that I wasn't going to buy. By the way, the photo packages start at $35 I think. Yea...I don't think so...especially when admission is quite costly as well. Anyway, the figures are divided into sections like SF icons, musicians, politicians, historical icons, and Hollywood figures. It was pretty cool how they had some very SF figures like Janis Joplin posed in a '60s setting with a hippie VW bus complete with a campfire and tent. This was more than just a figure; it was a complete scene from history. There was also scenes from Haight Street and the Golden Gate Bridge. There's also props like guitars, drum sets, umbrellas, etc to use at some of the figures, so you can take some more interesting photos. The Alfred Hitchcock figure was pretty cool because they had the shower set up from Psycho and you can step behind the shower curtain and use the knife and reenact the scene. There's special effects lighting and music too. The immersive, interactive displays were pretty fun. Overall, I think the museum is a bit too small and too pricey. The one is London is much better. However, I liked that they tried to put an SF twist to the museum. If you can find some coupons, or get a price you'd be happy with, then I think it's worthwhile to go. It's pretty cool to see the dimensions and proportions of famous people. Also, if you look at the Yelp photos on here, you can see a lot of people aren't shy about copping a feel! Grab that hottie's wax booty or feel up the biseps of Obama! When else would you have the chance?
