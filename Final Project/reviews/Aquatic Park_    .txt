One of the best open watering swimming spots around and a cool place for tourists just a stones throw from Ghirardelli. Parking is free just west of the park and there are tons of swimmers out on the weekends. Come join the fun!
Whenever I'm in the city and want to swim, this is my go to place! It's a great place for open water swimming for all levels. The water is usually calm and relaxing. There are 5 buoys parallel to the beach and what I have been told is that 3 loops equal a mile. Swimmers go either direction and mind their own business. Besides swimming, on weekends you may see groups of people exercising on the bleachers. Cyclists,  runners/walkers and tourists pass through the area frequently, as the wharf is not so far away. Across the street is Ghirardelli square. So after a nice swim you can have instant gratification by ordering a sundae or some hot chocolate. Oh yeah! Public bathrooms are not far since its on the other side of the museum but if your heading for some dessert, there are restrooms also located in Ghirardelli Square. Parking maybe a challenge on weekends. Van Ness street gets pretty packed quickly since its free for 4 hours or else there is metered parking for .25cents per half hour.. Not bad considering your in SF.
Aquatic park is at the foot of Polk Street on the Bay.With a fantastic view of Alcatraz and Hyde St. Pier it hardens to the historic periods that existed here.In the morning what a great place to start the day with the sound of the tide, the wind blowing and the stunning view of the Bay.Locals and tourists frequent the Park & it's an inspiring place to be.
Little piece of swimmers heaven! Whether you want to swim the protected cove, row a boat, sail or SUP this is the spot to do it. Very chill park with amazing city views. Sit in the bleachers, stroll the pier, have a Irish coffee at Buena Vista, watch for seals or panhandle for change, this park has it all.
Fleet Week in San Francisco is truly a great time: we get to honor and interact with the naval staff who work so hard for our country, visit the ships, but we all know that the stars of the show are the awesome Blue Angels.Once a year, the blue skies are interrupted with the roaring of these powerful jets. The squadron flies the Boeing F/A-18 Hornet and the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules. (Fat Albert!) Seeing these in action, being around aviation enthusiasts and photography fans while taking in the gorgeous views of San Francisco bay and Alcatraz make for a spectacular Sunday. And there's no other place to do it than Aquatic Park.5 "I love San Francisco" Stars!!!
So pretty but sooooo cold!Parking for a Saturday night wasn't bad. We actually found a spot or two that weren't too far from the entrance.Not sure if I should call this a dock but I feel like I want to call it that so here it goes. The dock was 1/3 gated off because you can see that the sea breeze was eating away at the metal on the dock. The walk all the way to the end wasn't bad. It was windy but that's how it is whenever you are near the water, so it was expected.The view as you're walking towards the end of the dock was gorgeous. You could get a perfect shot of Ghirardelli square on one side & a close view of Alcatraz on the other. There were a lot of "Watch for Swimmers" signs, come to find out, this is where the Polar Bear Club meets & swims. That is crayyy because it was sooooo cold! I can't imagine even putting my feet in the water, let alone swimming in it (Oh, I can't swim fyi) They had benches for people to sit that had high backs to shield you from some of the wind, I'm guessing. Walking back towards the shore, there is a man-made beach that has a little 2-3 stairway to step down to the sand. There was also what looked like stadium seating to watch a boat show. It's pretty cool. People were watching the sunset while sitting on it.From there it's a straight shot to Fisherman's Wharf & Pier 39.
I was in the area and looked for a place to walk and unwind, without all that jazz of Fisherman's Wharf. Aquatic Park to the rescue! There's a beach where people swim in every given water temperature, a large square-like seating area, and a looong pier.Yes, the pier. It really helps you to unwind. Walk to the end of it and get a fantastic view of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, and the San Francisco skyline. I do get why some Yelpers complain about the cleanliness but it's a city park after all. I tolerate.
Nice urban park with a small sliver of sand beach. Signs are posted that pets are not allowed on the beach, but I saw a number of dogs on the beach anyway. The views here are awesome. The Golden Gate bridge is on one side of you visual horizon and Alcatraz is on the other side of your visual horizon. In between, container ships roll in every few minutes, swimmers do laps the length of the beach, sailboats glide by in the distance, parasails can be seen further down the beach.We were there so that my 3 year old grandson and 5 year old granddaughter could run off some excess energy. We had brought some beach toys with us. They had a blast running along the beach, building sand castles, and filling the toy dump truck up with sand and pushing it along the beach. TIP: The adjacent Hyde pier has an outside sand rinse-off station just outside of the bathrooms.It is very windy and cool here, so bring a sweater or windbreaker along with your sunscreen and drinking water and have a great time.
I heard there are free group open water swims in the bay. Does anyone have any details about this, when and where they meet?Thanks!
It's really not that cold. Bible.Just do it & thank me later.
The Aquatic Park was nice.Arrived here around 5:45 am so I got to see the sun come out on a clear day. It was of course chilly, but as the sun came out became pretty warm. When my family and I first arrived, there were very few runners, bikers and walkers however as the time flew by more and more people came out.I was here to watch some people swim from Alcatraz back to the Aquatic Park, which reminded me of seeing other swimmers + wearing their wet suit. I could only imagine it's very cold in the ocean. lolNot a frequent visitor to the city however I had forgotten the dangers of homeless people. I wanted to sit on the bleachers closets to the Museum however I saw movement coming from this green colored sleeping bag, corner of my eyes so I bolted out of there. lol Then, I discovered more bleachers, which if you looked behind was Girardelli shop center so we sat over there when out of nowhere this one homeless guy came walking up/down the bleachers obviously talking to himself about Satan + evil + how they are out there and the dangers. He found someone's trash making it a sweet treasure for him as he finished someone's wine cooler. I actually felt sad for him. He came to our world just like any of us had as babies from our mother's womb and to have a life like that guy must be very difficult. Overall, Aquatic Park had a beautiful scenery and popular place for runners, bikers, walkers, swimmers, tourist, etc. Depending on weather, I got to see Alcatraz + Golden Gate Bridge very clearly + awesome weather today!!Definitely be back.
Lovely area, with or without fog (but especially without!) lots of families and tourists. There's a lot around too, such as food close by etc.
Its a nice open setting with close access to Ghiradhelli square, the Hyde Street pier as well as pier 39.
Jumpy Jump Ocean. "Daddy, let's go back to the beach," he says, "we can run freely on the warm sand, build sculptures and swim in the refreshing ocean." My son and I. The best connection ever.

A nice, peaceful park found right past Pier 39. Ghirardelli Square is located right down the street, and there are a ton of shipping options found all around the park. The beach is also a few feet a way.
Awesome little beach area right next to Ghirardelli Square! Spent time here following the chocolate festival, and would go back- calm little area with a bunch of free grass to lay on or amphitheater style seating to watch the water, in addition to a few rows of seating down in the sand. Saw a few seals in the water- they actually came pretty close to shore!Close to many restaurants and bars (albeit overpriced touristy ones), which is convenient for meeting up with friends.
I love this place!!! My favorite place to practice open water swimming!  It's ocean temperature, but without waves, and generally little, if any, current.  Beach entry/exit, although it can be muddy and rocky depending on where you enter and exit.Although there are several sailboats anchored here, I've never seen anything moving other than stand up paddle boards and safety escort boats for Alcatraz swims.Don't expect the public showers to work, and if they do, it's just a dribble.
This is one of our favorite places to visit when in SF for the day or a weekend.  Grab some food from one of the local eateries nearby and enjoy the sun and sand or cop a squat on the grass for a picnic.  Follow this up with a quick or not so quick swim or frolic in the ocean.  Great place to take the kids on a sunny day!
We didn't walk to the way end of the pier as I had planned on doing. As we walked a bit down it it seemed that going further wouldn't produce much better of a view. You can get a good view of SF, the famous chocolate sign, and the GGB just from going halfway around. You can also bike it and there are a good number of bike rental places in the immediate area. This is the only location in the city where there is still beach - as in sand. At the time we walked by there was a group of people racing homemade (I.e., cardboard) boats which was fun to stop and see. On a nice day there is a large section of cement steps so you could come and sit and read or something. There is a grassy park nearby too which had a good number of people sprawled out in it.
This place is a touristy place that's nice to walk around and faffe about. If you like boats and such you'd prolly like this more, but I prefer other parts of the city. Although you can watch Asians do their selfie stick thing I spose (dammit I need one).

Sit in the bleachers, stroll the pier, have a Irish coffee at Buena Vista, watch for seals or panhandle for change, this park has it all.
Fleet Week in San Francisco is truly a great time: we get to honor and interact with the naval staff who work so hard for our country, visit the ships, but we all know that the stars of the show are the awesome Blue Angels.Once a year, the blue skies are interrupted with the roaring of these powerful jets. The squadron flies the Boeing F/A-18 Hornet and the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules. (Fat Albert!) Seeing these in action, being around aviation enthusiasts and photography fans while taking in the gorgeous views of San Francisco bay and Alcatraz make for a spectacular Sunday. And there's no other place to do it than Aquatic Park.5 "I love San Francisco" Stars!!!
So pretty but sooooo cold!Parking for a Saturday night wasn't bad. We actually found a spot or two that weren't too far from the entrance.Not sure if I should call this a dock but I feel like I want to call it that so here it goes. The dock was 1/3 gated off because you can see that the sea breeze was eating away at the metal on the dock. The walk all the way to the end wasn't bad. It was windy but that's how it is whenever you are near the water, so it was expected.The view as you're walking towards the end of the dock was gorgeous. You could get a perfect shot of Ghirardelli square on one side & a close view of Alcatraz on the other. There were a lot of "Watch for Swimmers" signs, come to find out, this is where the Polar Bear Club meets & swims. That is crayyy because it was sooooo cold! I can't imagine even putting my feet in the water, let alone swimming in it (Oh, I can't swim fyi) They had benches for people to sit that had high backs to shield you from some of the wind, I'm guessing. Walking back towards the shore, there is a man-made beach that has a little 2-3 stairway to step down to the sand. There was also what looked like stadium seating to watch a boat show. It's pretty cool. People were watching the sunset while sitting on it.From there it's a straight shot to Fisherman's Wharf & Pier 39.
I was in the area and looked for a place to walk and unwind, without all that jazz of Fisherman's Wharf. Aquatic Park to the rescue! There's a beach where people swim in every given water temperature, a large square-like seating area, and a looong pier.Yes, the pier. It really helps you to unwind. Walk to the end of it and get a fantastic view of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, and the San Francisco skyline. I do get why some Yelpers complain about the cleanliness but it's a city park after all. I tolerate.
Nice urban park with a small sliver of sand beach. Signs are posted that pets are not allowed on the beach, but I saw a number of dogs on the beach anyway. The views here are awesome. The Golden Gate bridge is on one side of you visual horizon and Alcatraz is on the other side of your visual horizon. In between, container ships roll in every few minutes, swimmers do laps the length of the beach, sailboats glide by in the distance, parasails can be seen further down the beach.We were there so that my 3 year old grandson and 5 year old granddaughter could run off some excess energy. We had brought some beach toys with us. They had a blast running along the beach, building sand castles, and filling the toy dump truck up with sand and pushing it along the beach. TIP: The adjacent Hyde pier has an outside sand rinse-off station just outside of the bathrooms.It is very windy and cool here, so bring a sweater or windbreaker along with your sunscreen and drinking water and have a great time.
I heard there are free group open water swims in the bay. Does anyone have any details about this, when and where they meet?Thanks!
It's really not that cold. Bible.Just do it & thank me later.
The Aquatic Park was nice.Arrived here around 5:45 am so I got to see the sun come out on a clear day. It was of course chilly, but as the sun came out became pretty warm. When my family and I first arrived, there were very few runners, bikers and walkers however as the time flew by more and more people came out.I was here to watch some people swim from Alcatraz back to the Aquatic Park, which reminded me of seeing other swimmers + wearing their wet suit. I could only imagine it's very cold in the ocean. lolNot a frequent visitor to the city however I had forgotten the dangers of homeless people. I wanted to sit on the bleachers closets to the Museum however I saw movement coming from this green colored sleeping bag, corner of my eyes so I bolted out of there. lol Then, I discovered more bleachers, which if you looked behind was Girardelli shop center so we sat over there when out of nowhere this one homeless guy came walking up/down the bleachers obviously talking to himself about Satan + evil + how they are out there and the dangers. He found someone's trash making it a sweet treasure for him as he finished someone's wine cooler. I actually felt sad for him. He came to our world just like any of us had as babies from our mother's womb and to have a life like that guy must be very difficult. Overall, Aquatic Park had a beautiful scenery and popular place for runners, bikers, walkers, swimmers, tourist, etc. Depending on weather, I got to see Alcatraz + Golden Gate Bridge very clearly + awesome weather today!!Definitely be back.
Lovely area, with or without fog (but especially without!) lots of families and tourists. There's a lot around too, such as food close by etc.
Its a nice open setting with close access to Ghiradhelli square, the Hyde Street pier as well as pier 39.
Jumpy Jump Ocean. "Daddy, let's go back to the beach," he says, "we can run freely on the warm sand, build sculptures and swim in the refreshing ocean." My son and I. The best connection ever. I adore the privilege of being a parent. Too much love never spoils children. Children become spoiled when we substitute presents for presence.

A nice, peaceful park found right past Pier 39. Ghirardelli Square is located right down the street, and there are a ton of shipping options found all around the park. The beach is also a few feet a way.
Awesome little beach area right next to Ghirardelli Square! Spent time here following the chocolate festival, and would go back- calm little area with a bunch of free grass to lay on or amphitheater style seating to watch the water, in addition to a few rows of seating down in the sand. Saw a few seals in the water- they actually came pretty close to shore!Close to many restaurants and bars (albeit overpriced touristy ones), which is convenient for meeting up with friends.
I love this place!!! My favorite place to practice open water swimming!  It's ocean temperature, but without waves, and generally little, if any, current.  Beach entry/exit, although it can be muddy and rocky depending on where you enter and exit.Although there are several sailboats anchored here, I've never seen anything moving other than stand up paddle boards and safety escort boats for Alcatraz swims.Don't expect the public showers to work, and if they do, it's just a dribble.
This is one of our favorite places to visit when in SF for the day or a weekend.  Grab some food from one of the local eateries nearby and enjoy the sun and sand or cop a squat on the grass for a picnic.  Follow this up with a quick or not so quick swim or frolic in the ocean.  Great place to take the kids on a sunny day!
We didn't walk to the way end of the pier as I had planned on doing. As we walked a bit down it it seemed that going further wouldn't produce much better of a view. You can get a good view of SF, the famous chocolate sign, and the GGB just from going halfway around. You can also bike it and there are a good number of bike rental places in the immediate area. This is the only location in the city where there is still beach - as in sand. At the time we walked by there was a group of people racing homemade (I.e., cardboard) boats which was fun to stop and see. On a nice day there is a large section of cement steps so you could come and sit and read or something. There is a grassy park nearby too which had a good number of people sprawled out in it.
This place is a touristy place that's nice to walk around and faffe about. If you like boats and such you'd prolly like this more, but I prefer other parts of the city. Although you can watch Asians do their selfie stick thing I spose (dammit I need one).
