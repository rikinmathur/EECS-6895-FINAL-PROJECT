AHH the age of the microbrewery has taken over and Hopwater Distribution should be your go-to spot for local cali beer. We arrived on a Thursday 30 minutes before a Warriors game, and despite it not being a sports bar the place was pretty packed. My wife and I were lucky to snag some bar seats. The restaurant offers about 30 local cali beers on tap. The menu provides a pretty good description of taste and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable about providing suggestions as well in case you get stuck.I started with the Blitzen, a high content, triple IPA. The beer was delicious, plus it was 10% alcohol. As our buzz set in, we  took a gander at their food menu. The buttermilk chicken sandwich caught my eye. While waiting for the food to arrive, I ordered the Hella Hoppy, a 9% double IPA. I guess I was watching my IPA count...The food arrived shortly thereafter, and I was very happy with my chicken sandwich. The deep-fried buttermilk chicken was served on fresh sourdough baguette topped with slaw, mozzarella and chimichurri. I wasn't too sure how the chimichurri would work with the fried chicken, but I was happily surprised that it did. The sandwich came with thick cut steak fries which were good, but could have used a few more seconds in the frier to get more crispy. My wife ordered the veggie sandwich and was loving it until she found a black curly hair on her plate. She showed the bartender who was overly apologetic and immediately removed it from our bill. She then went above-and-beyond and offered another round of beers on them. A very nice showing of customer service. Ultimately, I really enjoyed my time at Hopwater.
Fun atmosphere! Came here starving around 9:30 pm and was so happy to find out they served food so late. The portions were a little on the small side... We got the crab tots, sliders, and chicken tenders, but I'm sure the main dishes are larger.Good beer too
Came last evening for a beer. Very cool set up for their crafted beer. Totally forgot to take a picture. Didn't get a chance to try a lot of their brews or any of their food. A quick stop before dinner. It was packed already by the bar but was still able to get a drink pretty quickly. They spotted us which was awesome. I had their Faction - Pale Ale $7. It was smooth. It was cold. Just the way I like the beer. I like the layout. A lot of seating and tables. Two floors. Will definitely be coming back.
Great spot to drop by for drinks and grab a bite to eat. There are lots of beers on tap! The staff is friendly and great at offering recommendations If you're not quite sure which beer to try. You could also ask to try out a few samples. The Oatmeal Stout was nice and smooth. It was my choice of beer for the night :) As for the food, the deviled egg was pretty good, chicken tender was just okay, and the sliders were a bit bland and too dry. Hopwater is more of a spot were you come for the drinks and food is more of an afterthought. Perhaps next time I visit, I'll find something on the food menu I really enjoy. If not, I'd still be very happy just to come back and check out the new rotation of beer on tap!It was a pretty good turnout on a Friday night yet it wasn't hard to find seats. If you have a larger party of more than 4, you might want to come earlier. We opted to sit at one of the booths on the 2nd floor that overlooks the bar area below. Great ambiance, lots of working professionals, pretty busy but not too loud to have a conversation. Definitely one of my new go-to spots if I'm in the area. Overall, it's a great spot to wind down from a long work week!
Glowing with lights and charm!  I adore this gastropub that is filled with a varietal of special draft beers and bite-sized dishes to delve into!It's self-order at the counter and the food compliments well with anything and everything.  Yes, it does and I just said it.  Wings, burgers and the gourmet of munchies.  I.E. I love the wings!  You name it!They have upstairs side booths and downstairs with adequate dining. A hung tv screen to watch whichever game is going on.Definitely a spot to chill at! Hop on over to Hopwater and get drinking!
30 different beers on tap! There's something for everyone, and it was a nice place to chillax if you come by a little later in the night, with a decent amount of seating for a bar, especially if you're old like me and don't want to deal w/ ridiculous crowds. The only downside is that they close so early, which is probably why it was a bit emptier by the time we got there. Last call was at 12:30am. Definitely coming back to try more of their ever rotating beer selection.
pretty solid....great selection of local taste.  I was really hammered so I don't recall much more
Came here on a Monday after work and it was actually pretty filled, which to me was a good sign that this place is so good that people will come during the week....and it is.First of all, they've got 30 beers on tap at a time which is awesome. They had a wide variety and selection as well, which meant everyone could get something they wanted. They do have food, but the menu is limited to bar foods like sliders, chicken wings, sandwiches, and burgers. You order food and beer at the counter and it gets delivered to you pretty quickly.Overall I'd say come here for the beer and relaxed atmosphere, have a bite to eat, and stay for another beer. Definitely a local gem!
Great place to grab drinks!Plenty of beer options, some wine options, and great service!Their snacks are delicious as well - definitely get their deviled eggs!Crowded on a weekday afternoon/early evening, but not too difficult to find an open spot.Will be back
Wonderful ambiance, friendly servers, great beers, and a great crowd!The hardest part was choosing WHICH beer(s) to get.  I wanted them ALL.Why only 3-stars?  I found the food to be really mediocre.Not "bad", just...not worth eating.Maybe it was my mistake for feeding myself at a beer joint?  I live far north of the wall, in culinarily-challenged Alaska.  My expectations are not high.  I figure just about any 'ol joint in SF will have much better eats than most spots in AK.  I am at a sandwich and it was painfully OK.Would I come back? Absolutely!I'll just get food somewhere else, beforehand.
I guess the allure of this place is just lost on me. The bartenders are super nice but the whole vibe of the place is nothing unique or special. They have a good variety of beers and food ranging from salads to sliders and from cheese to deviled eggs. There is no table service and it's hard to get a table sometimes. I guess I just think there are better places out there... Not bad if you want to grab a beer but very loud and hard for small groups or first dates to hear each other over the noise. Average spot- I doubt I will go out of my way to return. Sorry fans!
Nice craft beer selection. We shared a nice cheese platter and the duck trio appetizer. The crunchy, little cristini's served with the dishes were to hard and took away from the appetizer. Overall, a nice local spot for good beer.
Great place to go and chill with friends! It's pretty busy during the weekends but I went with a big group and it was fairly easy to find a place to sit down and enjoy a conversation.The service was great! Everybody was diligent, friendly and fast. We ordered some burger slides, some fries, and some chicken tenders and everything got delivered quite fast. I really enjoyed the apple sauce thing that came with the tenders, delicious!And for the good part: they have a LOT of different beers on tap. I love my porters and stouts and had a chance to try three different ones over there. The Almanic ones are pretty strong and heavy on the alcohol content but never the less they were really tasty.Would definitely recommend. Cheers!
Locals lined up waiting for the doors to open. Fantastic beer selection on tap. Highly recommend the cod sandwich and delicious steak fries.
I really wanted to love the place but I had such mixed feelings about the food here, which kinda drag that rating down.The ambiance and the place itself was beautiful and a wonderful hang out spot for groups.  We celebrated my bf's birthday here and we had a good 10 or more people so we got here early and sorta took over the back room. But it was that chill. No one cared and it was feel good fun with their so many beer on tap and their food you have to go to the bar to order and one waitress brings the plates to you.Okay so the food, we ordered the duck three ways, crab "tater tots", burger and crab salad. My friend order the deviled eggs with bacon and some other stuff, i don't really recall.  Let's start with the apps. So the duck three ways was amazing! i wanted to lick the plate! Lol the only downfall is that one of our friends came later and order the duck three ways and our plates did not look the same.  They added extra stuff to his plate which kinda threw us off and was disappointing.. The crab tots are not tater tots, hence the quotes i put prior when i was listing the food.  it was good but not a lot of crab and we were REALLY expecting tater tots. They really are just croquettes. The deviled eggs, I would recommend. It was pretty good.Now the main course.  The bf had the burger, which i asked for medium rare and it came out beyond well. It was really dry, which was disappointing because the seasoning of the burger was really good, but for us to keep eating the burger, we had to keep adding ketchup to get us through how dry it was.  The crab salad, for $17 (i think, might have been slightly more or less) was a completely rip off and definitely did not look like what a few people have posted in the pictures. It was such a huge let down. It was greens with some salty crab meat and sauce, that I can recall... the only thing good about it was the dressing, the dressing was pretty amazing. But like I said, huge let down.Prob will give this place another shot but not anytime soon.
Lots of beer on tap and friendly bartenders. Two floors with bar and table seating with high ceilings and rustic atmosphere.We tried: Dungeness Tater Tots, Deviled Eggs, Three House Blend Angus Sliders and the Pulled Pork Sliders. Even though the sliders come in 3s, the kitchen staff was nice enough to give our table 4s to make it easier to share. The food really didn't stand out- I thought the sliders were pretty dry and lacking something that I can't quite pinpoint. The tater tots and the deviled eggs were great bites. Beer selection is good and there's a lot of variety with food. Great place to unwind.
We trekked up to lower nob hill for a few delicious beers after a long day of sightseeing.  Hopwater was busy, but we were able to find a couple of spots at the bar.  The beer is super tasty.  So tasty that we had a few and ended up not being hungry for food.  Sigh.  The food that we did see all looked rather tasty.  They are not signed very well so be prepared to look hard for their location if you visit.
FOOD: Deviled egg with bacon jam - 4.5 stars - yum, this was bomb and hit the spot. 6 pieces for $7.Crab tater tots - 4 stars - 3.5 stars - this was good too, though 6 tiny little pieces for $12 was a little pricey that I might not get it again. Yes, it is crab.. but still. Since the deviled eggs were better and cheaper, I'd go with that. DRINKS:30 choices of beer! So if you love beer, come here. I took a sip of El Toro Poppy Jaspar Amber Ale and it was pretty good! Prices are only $6-7 too!VIBE/ATMOSPHERE: I like it, nice, clean, chill bar atmosphere, very cool spot playing hip hop throwbacks like Mary J Blige. I like how it's located in Union Square too, great place to chill after shopping or pregame before clubbing. OVERALL:Yes. I like and would come back again!
I have been coming to Hopwater at least once every two weeks for the last several months, so I thought it only right that I give them a shoutout.I love this place. They have 30 taps, which rotate regularly, and the service I get here is always great. The food menu is limited, but I'll be honest, I'm usually here for the beer. That said, I've enjoyed everything I've eaten thus far. Nothing gets me going quite like their burger with blue cheese and bacon, washed down by an IPA I hadn't previously heard of.Cons: no hard alcohol for those who aren't into brews, but they do have cider and wine for those folks. Another thing to note is they do have a few TVs, so you can catch some sportsball here on occasion.I will continue coming back.
Review is only for the beerThey have a pretty solid beer selection and a stout that I really enjoy..I think it's called north coast (?) don't quote me on thatThe food menu is ok but nothing stood out to me so I just stole a few of my soul sister's fries and nibbled on a bit of cheese. If you're looking for a chill place to grab a few beers, this is the spot!

Locals lined up waiting for the doors to open. Fantastic beer selection on tap. Highly recommend the cod sandwich and delicious steak fries.
I really wanted to love the place but I had such mixed feelings about the food here, which kinda drag that rating down.The ambiance and the place itself was beautiful and a wonderful hang out spot for groups.  We celebrated my bf's birthday here and we had a good 10 or more people so we got here early and sorta took over the back room. But it was that chill. No one cared and it was feel good fun with their so many beer on tap and their food you have to go to the bar to order and one waitress brings the plates to you.Okay so the food, we ordered the duck three ways, crab "tater tots", burger and crab salad. My friend order the deviled eggs with bacon and some other stuff, i don't really recall.  Let's start with the apps. So the duck three ways was amazing! i wanted to lick the plate! Lol the only downfall is that one of our friends came later and order the duck three ways and our plates did not look the same.  They added extra stuff to his plate which kinda threw us off and was disappointing.. The crab tots are not tater tots, hence the quotes i put prior when i was listing the food.  it was good but not a lot of crab and we were REALLY expecting tater tots. They really are just croquettes. The deviled eggs, I would recommend. It was pretty good.Now the main course.  The bf had the burger, which i asked for medium rare and it came out beyond well. It was really dry, which was disappointing because the seasoning of the burger was really good, but for us to keep eating the burger, we had to keep adding ketchup to get us through how dry it was.  The crab salad, for $17 (i think, might have been slightly more or less) was a completely rip off and definitely did not look like what a few people have posted in the pictures. It was such a huge let down. It was greens with some salty crab meat and sauce, that I can recall... the only thing good about it was the dressing, the dressing was pretty amazing. But like I said, huge let down.Prob will give this place another shot but not anytime soon.
Lots of beer on tap and friendly bartenders. Two floors with bar and table seating with high ceilings and rustic atmosphere.We tried: Dungeness Tater Tots, Deviled Eggs, Three House Blend Angus Sliders and the Pulled Pork Sliders. Even though the sliders come in 3s, the kitchen staff was nice enough to give our table 4s to make it easier to share. The food really didn't stand out- I thought the sliders were pretty dry and lacking something that I can't quite pinpoint. The tater tots and the deviled eggs were great bites. Beer selection is good and there's a lot of variety with food. Great place to unwind.
We trekked up to lower nob hill for a few delicious beers after a long day of sightseeing.  Hopwater was busy, but we were able to find a couple of spots at the bar.  The beer is super tasty.  So tasty that we had a few and ended up not being hungry for food.  Sigh.  The food that we did see all looked rather tasty.  They are not signed very well so be prepared to look hard for their location if you visit.
FOOD: Deviled egg with bacon jam - 4.5 stars - yum, this was bomb and hit the spot. 6 pieces for $7.Crab tater tots - 4 stars - 3.5 stars - this was good too, though 6 tiny little pieces for $12 was a little pricey that I might not get it again. Yes, it is crab.. but still. Since the deviled eggs were better and cheaper, I'd go with that. DRINKS:30 choices of beer! So if you love beer, come here. I took a sip of El Toro Poppy Jaspar Amber Ale and it was pretty good! Prices are only $6-7 too!VIBE/ATMOSPHERE: I like it, nice, clean, chill bar atmosphere, very cool spot playing hip hop throwbacks like Mary J Blige. I like how it's located in Union Square too, great place to chill after shopping or pregame before clubbing. OVERALL:Yes. I like and would come back again!
I have been coming to Hopwater at least once every two weeks for the last several months, so I thought it only right that I give them a shoutout.I love this place. They have 30 taps, which rotate regularly, and the service I get here is always great. The food menu is limited, but I'll be honest, I'm usually here for the beer. That said, I've enjoyed everything I've eaten thus far. Nothing gets me going quite like their burger with blue cheese and bacon, washed down by an IPA I hadn't previously heard of.Cons: no hard alcohol for those who aren't into brews, but they do have cider and wine for those folks. Another thing to note is they do have a few TVs, so you can catch some sportsball here on occasion.I will continue coming back.
Review is only for the beerThey have a pretty solid beer selection and a stout that I really enjoy..I think it's called north coast (?) don't quote me on thatThe food menu is ok but nothing stood out to me so I just stole a few of my soul sister's fries and nibbled on a bit of cheese. If you're looking for a chill place to grab a few beers, this is the spot!
AHH the age of the microbrewery has taken over and Hopwater Distribution should be your go-to spot for local cali beer. We arrived on a Thursday 30 minutes before a Warriors game, and despite it not being a sports bar the place was pretty packed. My wife and I were lucky to snag some bar seats. The restaurant offers about 30 local cali beers on tap. The menu provides a pretty good description of taste and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable about providing suggestions as well in case you get stuck.I started with the Blitzen, a high content, triple IPA. The beer was delicious, plus it was 10% alcohol. As our buzz set in, we  took a gander at their food menu. The buttermilk chicken sandwich caught my eye. While waiting for the food to arrive, I ordered the Hella Hoppy, a 9% double IPA. I guess I was watching my IPA count...The food arrived shortly thereafter, and I was very happy with my chicken sandwich. The deep-fried buttermilk chicken was served on fresh sourdough baguette topped with slaw, mozzarella and chimichurri. I wasn't too sure how the chimichurri would work with the fried chicken, but I was happily surprised that it did. The sandwich came with thick cut steak fries which were good, but could have used a few more seconds in the frier to get more crispy. My wife ordered the veggie sandwich and was loving it until she found a black curly hair on her plate. She showed the bartender who was overly apologetic and immediately removed it from our bill. She then went above-and-beyond and offered another round of beers on them. A very nice showing of customer service. Ultimately, I really enjoyed my time at Hopwater.
Fun atmosphere! Came here starving around 9:30 pm and was so happy to find out they served food so late. The portions were a little on the small side... We got the crab tots, sliders, and chicken tenders, but I'm sure the main dishes are larger.Good beer too
Came last evening for a beer. Very cool set up for their crafted beer. Totally forgot to take a picture. Didn't get a chance to try a lot of their brews or any of their food. A quick stop before dinner. It was packed already by the bar but was still able to get a drink pretty quickly. They spotted us which was awesome. I had their Faction - Pale Ale $7. It was smooth. It was cold. Just the way I like the beer. I like the layout. A lot of seating and tables. Two floors. Will definitely be coming back.
Great spot to drop by for drinks and grab a bite to eat. There are lots of beers on tap! The staff is friendly and great at offering recommendations If you're not quite sure which beer to try. You could also ask to try out a few samples. The Oatmeal Stout was nice and smooth. It was my choice of beer for the night :) As for the food, the deviled egg was pretty good, chicken tender was just okay, and the sliders were a bit bland and too dry. Hopwater is more of a spot were you come for the drinks and food is more of an afterthought. Perhaps next time I visit, I'll find something on the food menu I really enjoy. If not, I'd still be very happy just to come back and check out the new rotation of beer on tap!It was a pretty good turnout on a Friday night yet it wasn't hard to find seats. If you have a larger party of more than 4, you might want to come earlier. We opted to sit at one of the booths on the 2nd floor that overlooks the bar area below. Great ambiance, lots of working professionals, pretty busy but not too loud to have a conversation. Definitely one of my new go-to spots if I'm in the area. Overall, it's a great spot to wind down from a long work week!
Glowing with lights and charm!  I adore this gastropub that is filled with a varietal of special draft beers and bite-sized dishes to delve into!It's self-order at the counter and the food compliments well with anything and everything.  Yes, it does and I just said it.  Wings, burgers and the gourmet of munchies.  I.E. I love the wings!  You name it!They have upstairs side booths and downstairs with adequate dining. A hung tv screen to watch whichever game is going on.Definitely a spot to chill at! Hop on over to Hopwater and get drinking!
30 different beers on tap! There's something for everyone, and it was a nice place to chillax if you come by a little later in the night, with a decent amount of seating for a bar, especially if you're old like me and don't want to deal w/ ridiculous crowds. The only downside is that they close so early, which is probably why it was a bit emptier by the time we got there. Last call was at 12:30am. Definitely coming back to try more of their ever rotating beer selection.
pretty solid....great selection of local taste.  I was really hammered so I don't recall much more
Came here on a Monday after work and it was actually pretty filled, which to me was a good sign that this place is so good that people will come during the week....and it is.First of all, they've got 30 beers on tap at a time which is awesome. They had a wide variety and selection as well, which meant everyone could get something they wanted. They do have food, but the menu is limited to bar foods like sliders, chicken wings, sandwiches, and burgers. You order food and beer at the counter and it gets delivered to you pretty quickly.Overall I'd say come here for the beer and relaxed atmosphere, have a bite to eat, and stay for another beer. Definitely a local gem!
Great place to grab drinks!Plenty of beer options, some wine options, and great service!Their snacks are delicious as well - definitely get their deviled eggs!Crowded on a weekday afternoon/early evening, but not too difficult to find an open spot.Will be back
Wonderful ambiance, friendly servers, great beers, and a great crowd!The hardest part was choosing WHICH beer(s) to get.  I wanted them ALL.Why only 3-stars?  I found the food to be really mediocre.Not "bad", just...not worth eating.Maybe it was my mistake for feeding myself at a beer joint?  I live far north of the wall, in culinarily-challenged Alaska.  My expectations are not high.  I figure just about any 'ol joint in SF will have much better eats than most spots in AK.  I am at a sandwich and it was painfully OK.Would I come back? Absolutely!I'll just get food somewhere else, beforehand.
I guess the allure of this place is just lost on me. The bartenders are super nice but the whole vibe of the place is nothing unique or special. They have a good variety of beers and food ranging from salads to sliders and from cheese to deviled eggs. There is no table service and it's hard to get a table sometimes. I guess I just think there are better places out there... Not bad if you want to grab a beer but very loud and hard for small groups or first dates to hear each other over the noise. Average spot- I doubt I will go out of my way to return. Sorry fans!
Nice craft beer selection. We shared a nice cheese platter and the duck trio appetizer. The crunchy, little cristini's served with the dishes were to hard and took away from the appetizer. Overall, a nice local spot for good beer.
Great place to go and chill with friends! It's pretty busy during the weekends but I went with a big group and it was fairly easy to find a place to sit down and enjoy a conversation.The service was great! Everybody was diligent, friendly and fast. We ordered some burger slides, some fries, and some chicken tenders and everything got delivered quite fast. I really enjoyed the apple sauce thing that came with the tenders, delicious!And for the good part: they have a LOT of different beers on tap. I love my porters and stouts and had a chance to try three different ones over there. The Almanic ones are pretty strong and heavy on the alcohol content but never the less they were really tasty.Would definitely recommend. Cheers!
