Great time at the park today! Enjoying the weather, scenery and people watching. The park is beautiful... Close to tennis courts, dog parks and basketball courts
I love Mission Creek Park and so does my dog, Vega!  It's clean, quiet and still green!!  People typically leave you alone and most dogs are on a leash (and don't attack you).TIPS ::** Typically there is plenty of parking on the street, that is until all the new condos are built and occupied.** avoid it during game days** restrooms are available during certain hours (in that community building)** movie nights in the summer** you can book events there
Just discovered this place early this week and I am already an unconditional fan, even though I don't even have a dog to hang out with (well, I hang out with myself a lot and I promise you this place is also for you). Awesome early in the morning if you are in the mood of having your own picnic and do some sketching (like me), after an hour of bullet train (this place is just across the Caltrain station!). Very clean, safe, pretty and great for jogging.
Great public park with basketball courts, green way, and great dog friendly area. The basketball courts are one of the easier public courts to get court time.
My Hood! Great Walk with the Dogs!!!!
Good park to jog, play basketball and volleyball and did I mention there's an enclosed dog park too?? There's also a restroom, drinking fountain, tennis court and surprisingly this hasn't become a homeless encampment given the restroom.
The bathrooms are probably the nicest of any park in this city. They're not pristine or anything but it's clear that they're regularly maintained. The locks line up, soap in the dispenser, no collection of mysterious items on the floor, etc.Nice grass, decent pathways, lovely view of the water, and once the building around here finishes, you might be able hear some of it... maybe.
Move over Central Park!  ...okay, maybe not, BUT this is a nice park where you can walk along the water as enjoy an interesting view of the house boats, AT&T Park, and a construction site (condos, I think). Hidden, but sweet.
Mission Creek Park is one of the hidden gems of SF. It's tucked behind a bunch of condos, I would have never known it was there ! There are basketball courts, in the sun or if you prefer under the shade of the 280 freeway.Definitely a great place to hang out on a sunny day.
How can you not fall in LOVE with this park?! You're in the middle of the city and there's a gorgeous, clean park with a dog park, tennis court, bball court, volley ball court, picnic tables, kayaking and so much more!!! I'm ECSTATIC that I live across the street from this park and that it has a direct walk way taking you straight to AT&T Park on the backroads so you don't have to deal with the traffic and crazies on King Street. The ONLY gripe I have about this place that I really hope they can somehow fix is there is no direct entrance from 7th and Berry straight to the park. You have to go down 7th a bit and cross at the railroad crossing and make a U-turn to get to the park. I hope they can somehow build another crosswalk; if that's even possible. That's my only gripe, well, also that you can't bbq so there's no bbq pits, but it won't affect my 5-star review for it cause award winning parks like these are hard to come by, esp in the city!
Great job, Urban Renewal! Kudos to the Landscape Architects and Planners who designed this quaint, well manicured stretch of walk-park. It has a neighborhood feel in the middle of SOMA. Stroll along with your pup on a leash, enjoy the water view (and sometimes catch a glimpse of the sea lions playing the water!), and revel in this calm oasis in the City.
What a hidden treasure!My work brought our students here during the summer and it was a hit!The facility is regularly cleaned and a great place for city kids to enjoy the outdoors.Yes, it's tucked under the highway, but that's what makes it special.3 full basketball courts1 sand volleyball courtpicnic tablesclean restroomsFANTASTIC!We spent all day here. Folks who are from the city know that a park like this is hard to find. Can't wait to take the students back here!Until next time, happy park hunting!
Come here for a nice walk if you need it. Right along the "river" and boat houses. Take a look at the nice condos Ill never be able to afford either.I always walk this way when going to a Giants game.If you have dogs and want to walk them here then go right ahead. If you have a book you want to read then grab a blanket as well.Nice green grass, benches and nice scenery.
The view of the condo complexes from the grassy side reminds me of Vancouver BC (without the water taxis). Maybe the designers had this in mind when they planned out this small oasis. Maybe not. It possesses a sterile peacefulness of something brand new and not fully lived in. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a fine spot to eat lunch, walk the dog, sit for a spell, and finish that cup of Philz coffee from down the street.Despite the park's proximity to the ballpark, the landscaping successfully shelters you within the confines of its grass and trees. However, the empty lots south of the park are all zoned for residential communities which means that this park will become less and less serene as time goes by, so enjoy the peace and quiet while you can.On the north side of the creek, you will find a kayak hut, a few basketball courts, a volleyball court, a tennis court, a dog run at the end of Berry Street, and an off-leash dog run at the end of Berry Street.The very end of the creek past the house boats is still under construction, but you can walk or run around the whole waterway. After dark, you should watch your footing (and for random sketchy people) under the overpass.Mission Creek Park is well-maintained, relatively safe, and serves its neighborhood well. 4 Yelp stars.
If you promise to not over-run every square inch (Esprit or Dolores) and clean up after yourself and your dog companions, I will tell you about a fantastic new-to-me park. Promise? Here you go: Mission Creek Park runs west from Fourth Street Bridge to that cool blue-tone tiled public utilities-looking building (a.k.a. Channel Pump Station Odor Control and Facility). In addition to the pristine, manicured grassy areas on both the north and south sides of the creek, you'll find some well-designed landscaping with native marsh plants, a thoughtful reminder of Mission Bay's past life as wetlands. Other points of interest are a fenced off-leash dogs-only park, basketball and tennis courts (check out the incredibly clean bathrooms!), and the sculptural Kayak House designed by MKThink. Although not actually part of Mission Creek Park, my favorite part is the less domesticated section on the south side by the cute houseboats. Managed by the houseboat owners, it's called Huffaker Park and has lots of flowering plants and trees. Walk a little further and there's a community garden, which is just lovely. I'll be excited to see how they develop the dead zone underneath the overpass at the west end. It's a little creepy in its current condition.
I've worked in the area for four years, and never thought to cross the caltrain tracks. an abstract thought on a friday.i was dazed, walking through. Who knew such a beautiful place was across the street!?There's a great walking loop from the 7th street entrance, through dirt paths with lots of greenery and flowers and butterflies, awesome houseboats, beautiful scenery, and sports courts and a dog park. not to mention the meandering fat creek dividing the park. I'll be coming here every week now, to wear out my work shoes
For the smallest (and furriest) Giants fan in your clan, why not make sure on the dog days of summer they get a nice place to run around before waiting patiently for 9 innings for you to drop a chunk of hot dog?
This park is very nice and represents mission bay very well. It is such a nice neighborhood and such a nice park. It is in excellent condition and I really enjoy the views. It is great to come here relax and unwind.The only real down side is that I find dog poop here sometimes but rather than that it is very nice.
Great clean park for running, biking, walking your dog.  Lots of dogs in the area and the park creates a nice loop for running (except the part that they're renovating where homeless folks camp out).The creek is home to many water fowl (much to the delight of my dogs) and the part near the houseboats has lots of beautiful plant life that the park has cultivated.
First?  Are you freakin' kidding me?  Aren't those brand-new condos on Berry full of Yelpers who look out their windows at this park every day?  I'd be all over this place if I were them.  Seriously, that might be the only block in SOMA I'd actually consider living on.  A view of Mission Creek and being able to head over the bridge to the park...of course, I'd probably only be able to afford the units that face the Caltrain tracks.  So never mind.Anyway, if you haven't experienced the moonscape that is Mission Bay, check it out now before it's too late.  Mission Creek Park is one of the few elements out here that's actually finished, and it looks like it's right out of some CG "urban renewal" brochure.  Which is a good thing...mostly.  It does look a little sterile, but give it time to weather a bit.  Maybe it'll get some character like those house boats down at the end of the creek (now there's a positively un-San Franciscan sight for you).  All they need to do is reopen Carmen's as some sort of bayou brunch spot, and presto! the Mission Creek Little N'awlins district will be on its way.  When the cars start e-parking on the 4th St bridge, you'll know it's a success.

However, the empty lots south of the park are all zoned for residential communities which means that this park will become less and less serene as time goes by, so enjoy the peace and quiet while you can.On the north side of the creek, you will find a kayak hut, a few basketball courts, a volleyball court, a tennis court, a dog run at the end of Berry Street, and an off-leash dog run at the end of Berry Street.The very end of the creek past the house boats is still under construction, but you can walk or run around the whole waterway. After dark, you should watch your footing (and for random sketchy people) under the overpass.Mission Creek Park is well-maintained, relatively safe, and serves its neighborhood well. 4 Yelp stars.
If you promise to not over-run every square inch (Esprit or Dolores) and clean up after yourself and your dog companions, I will tell you about a fantastic new-to-me park. Promise? Here you go: Mission Creek Park runs west from Fourth Street Bridge to that cool blue-tone tiled public utilities-looking building (a.k.a. Channel Pump Station Odor Control and Facility). In addition to the pristine, manicured grassy areas on both the north and south sides of the creek, you'll find some well-designed landscaping with native marsh plants, a thoughtful reminder of Mission Bay's past life as wetlands. Other points of interest are a fenced off-leash dogs-only park, basketball and tennis courts (check out the incredibly clean bathrooms!), and the sculptural Kayak House designed by MKThink. Although not actually part of Mission Creek Park, my favorite part is the less domesticated section on the south side by the cute houseboats. Managed by the houseboat owners, it's called Huffaker Park and has lots of flowering plants and trees. Walk a little further and there's a community garden, which is just lovely. I'll be excited to see how they develop the dead zone underneath the overpass at the west end. It's a little creepy in its current condition.
I've worked in the area for four years, and never thought to cross the caltrain tracks. an abstract thought on a friday.i was dazed, walking through. Who knew such a beautiful place was across the street!?There's a great walking loop from the 7th street entrance, through dirt paths with lots of greenery and flowers and butterflies, awesome houseboats, beautiful scenery, and sports courts and a dog park. not to mention the meandering fat creek dividing the park. I'll be coming here every week now, to wear out my work shoes
For the smallest (and furriest) Giants fan in your clan, why not make sure on the dog days of summer they get a nice place to run around before waiting patiently for 9 innings for you to drop a chunk of hot dog?
This park is very nice and represents mission bay very well. It is such a nice neighborhood and such a nice park. It is in excellent condition and I really enjoy the views. It is great to come here relax and unwind.The only real down side is that I find dog poop here sometimes but rather than that it is very nice.
Great clean park for running, biking, walking your dog.  Lots of dogs in the area and the park creates a nice loop for running (except the part that they're renovating where homeless folks camp out).The creek is home to many water fowl (much to the delight of my dogs) and the part near the houseboats has lots of beautiful plant life that the park has cultivated.
First?  Are you freakin' kidding me?  Aren't those brand-new condos on Berry full of Yelpers who look out their windows at this park every day?  I'd be all over this place if I were them.  Seriously, that might be the only block in SOMA I'd actually consider living on.  A view of Mission Creek and being able to head over the bridge to the park...of course, I'd probably only be able to afford the units that face the Caltrain tracks.  So never mind.Anyway, if you haven't experienced the moonscape that is Mission Bay, check it out now before it's too late.  Mission Creek Park is one of the few elements out here that's actually finished, and it looks like it's right out of some CG "urban renewal" brochure.  Which is a good thing...mostly.  It does look a little sterile, but give it time to weather a bit.  Maybe it'll get some character like those house boats down at the end of the creek (now there's a positively un-San Franciscan sight for you).  All they need to do is reopen Carmen's as some sort of bayou brunch spot, and presto! the Mission Creek Little N'awlins district will be on its way.  When the cars start e-parking on the 4th St bridge, you'll know it's a success.
