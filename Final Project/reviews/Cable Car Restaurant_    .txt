The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is that I've never had anything but a burger and fries here...but their burgers and fries are excellent. I have been coming here pretty regularly for over a decade. There is limited seating, but they have a couple of extra tables to sit outside on a nice day. Great, friendly people. They truly don't make restaurants like this anymore.
Want a food truck experience in a cable car?  Well Tony's isn't a real cable car, but sitting in a real cable car converted to a food truck would be awkward.First of all, the rating isn't for food, but nostalgia.  I grew up here in SF and Tony's has been here 40+ years and I had never stepped inside once.  True San Franciscans will recall there was once a Doggie Diner just  10 blocks away and that is what this place reminded me of.Its all kitsch from the old sign and clock.  Its like they even staged the people eating there.  My buddy and I walked in and everyone there was silent.  The place was crowded but the dozen or so people all had to be over 60 and eating alone.I love the old black felt menu board with  the white pressed in numbers and letters.  There is something special about getting a meal cooked on a greasy old grill.  And also getting something that feels like it was made to order for you and not stamped out. My buddy got the chili cheese dog and I got a cheeseburger. We also shared fries.The chili dog was smothered in chili and the burger and accoutrements (can I use that fancy word for a cable car diner?) were more fresh than expected. The lettuce and tomato were still cold!  Oh and yes the fries were those crinkle fries!  If you love crinkle fries, you must get them here!Overall I don't know how often I will eat here, but if I have the time and am tempted, I will stop here for some nostalgia and a good burger whenever passing by with a grumbling appetite.Wor
The Hamburger place that time forgot! I feel at home here. Classic American fast food joint. Ordered a Cheeseburger, fries (Crinkle cut!!!) and a coke. (Jalapeños are free!) If you don't like this place you're not only in American, you got a hole in your heart.
The onion rings must be sent from an oily heaven where they are struck down from the batter gods.
Super old school. I feel like I traveled back in time when I came to this restaurant, from the faded signs on the wall to the plastic letter board menu. I had the Small Beef Burger, which was the perfect size for me. I like that there is so much variety here for all cravings and appetites. I also got the Seasoned Curly Fries which were so good. The shake that my friend got was also very tasty. Nothing out of the ordinary about this restaurant, but definitely one that I would encourage if you are looking for simple, inexpensive, unpretentious American food.
Oh, so disappointed! And I really wanted to like this place.I have always noticed Tonys Cable Car Restaurant sitting right off of Geary. During the beginning of my pregnancy I went to the Kaiser across the street and always dreamed of having someone deliver me a giant burger to chow down on after giving birth. Well, we moved and that didn't happen. But, then we moved back! Anyway, my husband and I made it a point to come here after a friend of ours just described this place as "In n Out burger times 10". So we made our way over and ordered. The size of the burgers was so unimpressive. Tiny and thin. And mostly the thing that makes me never want to try this place again was the amount of mustard. I mean I fully understand that mustard comes on burgers but this was saturated. Both sides of the bun. I mean it was all I could taste! Well, I would be down to try this place again and order something different but I sadly don't think i'll make it a point to ever come back. Sigh
Good, classic food and super friendly service. Sometimes I stop in just for a malt if I'm passing by. You can't go wrong here.
It is an old style fast food shop on Geary Blvd.  I came here for lunch and ordered a fish and chip.   The fries were crispy and fresh.  Fish had not much taste.  Portion was decent.  I like the friendly staffs over there.  Like the old style decoration.  Cash only.  I will probably come back again if nearby, but won't make an extra trip to come.
For Drunk eats this place can not be beaten.Their burgers are really good...it aint Nieman Ranch, or Prather blah blah but is sure tastes great.Fries, Onion rings, and Milk Shakes are also very good.On a nice night chill outside and dine alfresco on lovely Geary Blvd.
I like Tony's. The place has been there forever (or since 1972, anyway), and has been pretty consistant all along. I can remember long ago, eating at Tony's Cable Car after shopping at the (now long defunct) Sears across the street (where Target is now). Tony's hasn't changed that much over the years - basic fast food with championshop shakes - and maybe that's what people like about it. I know In do.As a side note, the chili is great on a cold day in the Western Addition :)
This place has been here for ever. But I remember the food being better. I'm not sure it was even a beef burger, bland and limp. Curly fries crisp but certainly not spicy. You feel like your ordering in a check cashing place in the heart of rough tenderloin. Place was clean and service was average.
Really good classic burgers and fries. And the gentleman who runs the place is super nice. I was a dollar short and he let it slide. Burgers are tasty, juicy and interesting. Great shakes too.
Yo Tony. You're a little cable car of place stuck precariously on the side of Geary in the midst of nondescript buildings. And I love you just the way you are. Don't you go and be all fancy with a makeover.  The grime of authenticity can never be replaced once it has been erased. Don't you ever change. Keep it a little greasy and don't update that menu that hasn't changed since around the time Ford was president. It's easier that way and it clings to one's soul like gum that you can't shake off your fingers. Sure the ketchup bottles may need a wipe down but there's no one around who cares. It's just you and your brother (I'm going out on a limb here but you too look alike) and a bunch of us hungry worker ants on the other side of the counter, stuffing our faces with food that's recognizable and timeless. Simple pleasures like potato,tomato, beef patty and bun hun. It's like that.
Sweetest man behind the counter. Classic American diner. awesome food. super cheesy grilled cheese. we were hungry for breakfast and randomly decided to stop here. great curly fries. I really want to try their shakes! it was pretty full for a Sunday at 11. Fun experience!
Tony's isn't in a real cable car, just painted/designed to looked like it.lots of variety on menu. A few tables to sit in or out.eats: 1/4# burger(5.70?)inquired about cooking med. rare-yes, old man said. wasn't rare, was medium with gristle at best-pattie to thin to be cooked med. rare-fresh bun, lots of lettuce, tomato, pickles, red onions.2ish stars.crumbs:-should have ordered the jumbo hot dog instead(3.80)-friendly service, not so good food.
Awesome little burger joint! I got a hamburger with everything on it, and seasoned curly fries. One of the best burgers I've had in SF. It was my first time there and I would definitely go back! They definitely load your burger with goodies so make sure if you don't like something, remember to tell them to not put it on it.
Old school burger, fries and shake.  Hot and fresh tasting.Little things matter: they make your drink when your order is ready instead of handing it to you in advance so that it melts away.   And you can park!
What a gem! Just had a huge grilled chicken on a wheat bun, with grilled onions, avocado, along with the usual tomato, lettuce pickle. Made to order by Tony's brother Sam, with my special order taken by Tony's daughter with a smile.If you want a true diner experience at a true long-term family run business in San Francisco, for well under $10, this is the place!Close to Kaiser and Target!
I used to live in the neighborhood and solely come here for their french fries! Awesome crispy crinkle fries! I have had some of their menu items in the past, however it's just bland in comparison with the fries. If I were still living in the neighborhood, I'd be back!
Love this place! Close to my work and they have delicious shakes, turkey burgers and fries. The crinkle cut fries are not greasy and crisp. They give you a lot too. The older gentleman at the register (assuming he's the owner) is such a nice guy! Hope this place sticks around for a little while longer.

Old school burger, fries and shake.  Hot and fresh tasting.Little things matter: they make your drink when your order is ready instead of handing it to you in advance so that it melts away.   And you can park!
What a gem! Just had a huge grilled chicken on a wheat bun, with grilled onions, avocado, along with the usual tomato, lettuce pickle. Made to order by Tony's brother Sam, with my special order taken by Tony's daughter with a smile.If you want a true diner experience at a true long-term family run business in San Francisco, for well under $10, this is the place!Close to Kaiser and Target!
I used to live in the neighborhood and solely come here for their french fries! Awesome crispy crinkle fries! I have had some of their menu items in the past, however it's just bland in comparison with the fries. If I were still living in the neighborhood, I'd be back!
Love this place! Close to my work and they have delicious shakes, turkey burgers and fries. The crinkle cut fries are not greasy and crisp. They give you a lot too. The older gentleman at the register (assuming he's the owner) is such a nice guy! Hope this place sticks around for a little while longer.
