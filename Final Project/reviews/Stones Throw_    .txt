Before anything, their **Squid Ink Pasta was AMAZING!The whole dining experience was a 4.5 Star. Everything was really good. Service was great. Dim lighting with warm decor. Reservations recommended. **Puffed Potato & Eggs with Cauliflower Mousse was okay. Probably the least favorite dish. Was hoping for a little more flavor and crispier. **Duck Pate & Mousse with Soft Pretzel. WOW!!! The pate was delicious. Perfect blend with the mustard and cornichons. The pretzel was warm and soft. I needed more, delicious! **SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA is made with Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens. It's really the best squid Ink pasta I EVER HAD!! Must try from someone who doesn't really like squid ink before Stones Throw. So much flavor, so good. It was the best dish of the night!!**PORK BELLY - Good texture, good flavor and it was crunchy. Comes with 3 pieces. **Beef Ribeye and Braised Shortribs - Plated with Potatoes, Cabbage, Onion and Chimichurri. I love it because you get a little of both. Steak was cook to its best, medium rare and the rib was soft and tender. Good flavor.As for dessert, we got their Blackberry Crisp, cheesecake. It was super yummy. Not too sweets. Yum!
After reading an article from Zagat about Stones Throw's brunch I decided to check it out on Yelp, to my surprise I had already book marked it!  Looking at the menu + pictures, I decided I had to try it out.  I search on a table for Sunday morning and OMG, they have availability the upcoming weekend.  No, I didn't have to schedule it weeks in advance and no I didn't have to go online at midnight to try to get a table for the next day block (30 or 60). Approximately an hour before our reservations I receive two text messages from them.  First one to double check if our situation had changed and whether or not we were still coming.  And the second one was a tip regarding parking.  They suggested we take an Uber and if we did, it would be 5% off our entire meal!  Woaaa that is sooo cool!  We opted not to take Uber, only because we had several errands we had to run that day.  We will definitely take them up on that offer when we have dinner there.  And trust me, after that brunch... we will have many dinners there.Reservations were at a decent time, 11:30!!  We show up about 25 minutes early, because we're always early.  Luckily they have availability and seat us immediately.  We ordered:** PITCHER OF PIMM'S :: 4/5 stars :: for $20, it's a pretty good deal.  And normally I'd say a pitcher for $20 is a great deal, but the pitcher was FULL of ice and the glasses they brought to pour the PIMM'S in was also full of ice... so it was a bit deceptive.  But it was very refreshing and great compliment to brunch** SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE sans scallions :: 5/5 stars :: so much flavor!  mousse was extremely smooth and the pickled items they added complimented the mousse w/o overpowering it.  I think they also added fried capers, which I love!  It added another level of texture.  The bagel chips were a bit hard, I was worried about my teeth on a couple bites!  :D** DUCK CONFIT HASH :: 5/5 stars :: I don't even know where to begin. This was AHHHH-mazing!  I don't even want to describe it, I know I can't do it justice!  Only one other thing to note, I don't even like English peas, but they made me like it!** "DA BURGA" aka DA DISASTER :: 5/5 stars :: everything was perfect, from the great sauces all the way down to the ooey gooey of the cheese melting down the sides of the patty!  Probably my favorite burger in the city for now.Staff was friendly and perfectly attentive.  I love this place and can't wait to come back for dinner!  Happy eating!
3.5 stars. Stones Throw is the stereotypical yuppie SF restaurant. I'll leave that up to your interpretation :P I recommend sharing the appetizers and avoiding the entrees. Puffed Potato & Eggs: 3 stars Egg yolk inside a fried mashed potato ball. What is there not to love? Unfortunately, I found this to be bland yet salty at the same time. How is that even possible?! Squid Ink Pasta: 4.5 stars Delicious but wish the squid ink flavor was a bit stronger. Duck Pate: 4 stars I found the warm pretzel rolls a weird bread choice to go with the duck pate but the pate itself is pretty on point. The entrees are not worth detailing. We had the duck confit (dry) and some type of steamed white fish (flavorless).
Da burger is da bomb, forealz!I've eaten at this place twice already. The BF and I enjoy this place very much and just about everything on their menu. We do have our favorite; which is "Da burger", but for the most part everything is made very well. The chef's tasting profile is on point in my opinion. This place has over 500+ reviews, and it's just about at 5 stars. I think that tell you a lot. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said.Food was great, it can be pricey, parking totally sucks, service was super friendly and attentive. This place is now one of our favorites, but mainly as the BF's "best tasting burger" he ever had type of thing.
What a unique and special experience! Stones Throw and renowned Chef, Dominique Crenn came together and prepared an incredible 5-course meal and ALL proceeds went to charity!  I've never had an experience quite like this.. "At its best, cooking is an alchemical process that transforms ingredients beyond the simple chemical reactions sparked by heat and cold, oil and acid. The act of cooking is an engagement with tradition, community, time and place. And for me, cooking it poetry". Dominique Crenn. Dominique describes making food as an Art and it is very important to use all 5 senses; seeing, tasting, hearing, touching and smelling, to really understand this art form!. I may not be able to explain and articulate each dish quite as they did, but I can share my experience visually. :) (See photos)Service: Without a hitch! 6 star! ;) They were so knowledgeable about each dish and gave great detail in the preparation. Their professionalism and explanation from each of the Servers was impressive. Food:Pre-course (to cleanse the palate): A white chocolate ball filled with champagne topped with  raspberry gel. Its very delicate and pops in your mouth. (Very cleverly created)  First Course - Spring Pea Salad with smoked trout, brioche and Hen eggSecond Course - Poached Striped Bass, with asparagus, little gems and lemon agrumatoThird Course - Monterey Squid with lardo, potato and smoked ham broth. With fried ink chipsFourth Course - Aged Duck with beets and wild berriesFifth Course - Raspberry Clafoutis - A Lemon curd, angel food cake and crème de violetteThe combination of ingredients made for incredible flavors. There is definitely a science behind their creations, which made the experience and taste utterly amazing!Location: In Mission Hill, in a cute residential area. Street parking available.Price: $76 per person all inclusive (We pre-paid in advance for this special event).We brought 2 bottles of wine which they accommodated. Loved every minute of this place.. I'll be back!
Recently returned for brunch after two years and still enjoyed it!We ordered the Pork Belly Tomato Sauce with Baked Eggs & Avocado Toast ($15) and the Salmon Mousse ($8) along with two glasses of wine. This was the perfect size to share between two people. The mousse was delicious but light and airy, and the baked eggs were super delicious on top of Polenta and the side of avo toast was delightful!Overall, a solid option for brunch fare as well in the Russian Hill area!
Came by with a reservation via OpenTable the other night and was certainly glad that I did as I was seated immediately upon arrival to a full restaurant! Parking in Russian Hill is challenging and the restaurant does offer 5% off your bill for using Uber.The restaurant itself is unique as it's in an older building. There are even a couple standing tables by the door near the bar for a casual meal!Started off with the squid ink conchiglie pasta which was on the salty side. The pasta had a fantastic texture and the seafood tasted fresh!Moved on to the puffed potato & eggs and this one was lackluster. It was sort of bland, although it was unique in the sense that it had an egg yolk inside the puff potato! The cauliflower mousse and crispy chicken skin was a unique add-on to the dish.The spring vegetable salad was very good. Vegetables were fresh and the custard made the salad filling!I was a big fan of Da Burga as the bread was light and fluffy! The burger patty was freshly made and crumbled nicely with the bread. I also enjoyed the coleslaw that blended quite well with the burger. The tater tots were okay.Ended off the meal with the Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts which was the highlight of the meal. The beignets were light and fluffy (if only they could make them filled!) The peanut butter and jelly with the dish complemented this dessert quite well!Ambiance of the restaurant was more on the casual side as it was pretty loud inside and the tables were pretty close together... Staff was friendly! ~$45/head after tax and tip. There is a ~5% SF Health charge for the wait staff.
This place had more hype than Beyonce's debut album, and both seemed to disappoint to tickle my fancy!?! We had reservations at noon, we arrived about 15mins early and they told us to wait outside for a few mins until a table clears up and then they will call us in.  So we sat outside on a bench like hobos waiting for our name to be called. I see another couple walk in and when we went inside to go check at noon to see if our table was ready, they were seated before us and no our table for 2 is still is not ready, but there's is?!? So we had to wait another 10 mins and this time I just stood right in front of the hostess giving her the "Eastside San Jose death look" so she doesn't give our table away again!?! #SoFrustratingAlso the menu is very simple, not a lot of selection but that is fine as long as the dishes are good "Quality over Quantity" like I always tell my playas.The Original Cup - super gingery if you're into thatSalmon Mousse Dip - really good, best thing we ordered, not enough bread given for the dip amount though so make sure you ask for secondsDuck Confit Entree - dry, small portion, really expensive, disappointmentSpicy Eggs w/Polenta & Pork Belly in Tomato sauce - not really spicy, a-ok, nothing special I don't know playas?...despite all the high Yelp ratings I was not impressed.  The food was like 3.7, the service was like 3.1, I wish I could give it a higher rating but I can't, and I won't, and as Arnold would not say "I won't be back"...
Small menu that changes seasonally. All the dishes we ordered were considerably well prepared and delicious. My favorites: + Puffed Potato and Eggs (cauliflower mousse, chives, crispy chicken skin) + Crispy-skinned trout (celery root, roasted Brussels sprouts, beef jus)
Celebrated my anniversary here with my BF last week! Made a reservation in advance which is a smart idea considering the restaurant is limited in space and takes quite a while to get the food out.We arrived at 8PM on a Tuesday night and were seated right away. The food selection was simple and straightforward while the drink selection was widely diverse. He went with the pizza port and I with a dessert wine to start the dinner. Upon seating, there was a card on the table which I thought was super sweet!Thanks to our fellow Yelpers, we went with the puffed potato and eggs and squid ink pasta for starters and had no regrets. The former had an amazing texture and the flavors exploded in your mouth when you piece the dish together. The squid ink pasta is to die for - it's a must! The seafood flavor developed in the pasta is divine and so fresh. My BF and I agreed that we would order an entree side of this if we can.For entrees, we went with the duck breast and ribeye / shortrib duo. Duck was cooked great and served on top of a bed of grains and ribeye / shortrib duo was tasty but for us, the highlight of the meal was the squid ink pasta hands down. We ended our dinner with complimentary pb&j beignets which was portioned so small we were craving more.We walked here but I assume the parking situation is tough around the area. Bill for the both of us came out to be around $120 with tip and tax. Overall, ambience of this place was wonderful and service was top-notch. The vibe of Stones Throw really embodies San Francisco and I'm so glad we chose to celebrate our special day here away from Los Angeles.
Leave no STONE unturned.My brother kindly took my mom, myself, and some friends to dinner on our last night in the bay area.  I found out that same night that he was wanting to try this restaurant for some time, and he thought a "last supper" with the family was a good reason for an inaugural visit.And about that STONE being unturned, I guess in this case the STONE would be a metaphor for the menu.  My advice:  peruse the menu carefully as there are certainly many appetizing dishes to choose from.The restaurant is cozy, yet elegant and simply decorated.  Though we were slightly early for our reservation, the host extended a warm welcome and showed our group of five to our table.Some of the group did their due diligence in researching (via Yelp) the more popular or well-known dishes.  However, their menu has many appetizers, entrees, etc. to choose from, as well as an extensive wine and spirits list.FOOD:  Thanks to some helpful recommendations via Yelp, our group chose a variety of appetizers to share, these included the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate & mousse, and the squid ink pasta.  Firstly, do order the puffed potato and eggs and the squid ink pasta.  All of the accolades from other yelpers are indeed true.  The potato and eggs are fluffy, light and delicious, while the pasta delivers bold flavors thanks to the seafood combination of calamari, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The duck pate and mousse was alright, and I'd recommend asking for more bread if needed.  My dinner entree was the butternut squash ravioli.  It was simply divine.  Cheesey goodness is more like it actually.  Although the portion was smaller than I anticipated, the gnnochi was excellent.  The brussels sprout pesto, truffle, and sage complemented the ricotta gnudi splendidly.  In contrast, my mother ordered the trout, accompanied with brussels sprouts, celery root and beef jus.  She liked it every much, as evident by her finishing almost the entire portion.I think the entree our table was most in awe of was the burger, or "DA BURGA" as its aptly named on the menu.  This entree is of gargantuan proportions and is every bit as mouthwatering as it looks.....from what I was told by my two tablemates that ordered this behemoth burger.  The burger bun is equally just as thick as the meat that sits between the two pieces, which barely contained the melted cheddar cheese that slowly trickled onto the plate.  And its companion?  Not just your ordinary fries, but baked potato tator tots.  I was able to try a tator tot, and after doing so I began to doubt my original decision to order the gnnochi.  I suppose a second visit is in order on a future trip to the bay area.SWEET TREAT:  To end the meal, we all shared the peanut butter and jelly donuts.  For all my Hawaii friends and family on Yelp, this is basically the bay area's version of malasadas.  The generous portion of jelly within the donut was, of course, a fantastic combination with the peanut butter and truly brought back fond childhood memories.  A comfort food and dessert rolled into one.  SERVICE:  Outstanding.  Our server was a friendly and humorous woman who was extremely patient with our group, and took the time to answer all our questions to the best of her ability.  She kindly offered recommendations on appetizers, entrees, and cocktails.  She checked on us in a timely during the entire meal and provided excellent customer service.  BOTTOM LINE:  An incredible meal with wonderful friends and family.  I'll be back to try "DA BURGA" for sure!!  Those peanut butter and jelly donuts are awesome!
Best dinner I've had in a awhile! This is the sister restaurant of Trestle and it's delicious. I've been here before and got the royal treatment because one of my good friends boyfriends was the chef. Me and a group of 5 friends went on a Saturday night. Initially, I thought my friend had said 9 people were coming and it confused both the hostesses, but there were really nice and able to seat all 5 of us. This place is always packed so reservation are a must. The group ordered 2 appetizers and opted not to order from the small plates section. Although there was a puffed potatoe and egg dish I wanted to try with Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin recommended by the waiter. I will have to try this the next time we go. The 2 appetizer ordered were the squid ink conchiglie pasta with spicy caper, clams, calamari, shrimp, and tender greens and the grilled spanish octopus confit potatoe, white beans, chorizo, raddichio, and saffron aoli. Both appetizer were amazing. I'd have to say that I liked the squid ink pasta the best. I ordered the ricotta and nettle ravioli with english peas, roasted mushrooms, cippolini onions, and beurre blanc. I also loved this dish, but I probably should have paid attention to the fact that there were peas included. I'm not the biggest fan of peas, but this dish had the right texture and flavor. Everything we had was great! We ordered the ho hos dessert and that was also amazing! We were trying to share it among 5 people and it was so tough. I wanted to eat the entire thing myself. I recommend this as an authentic San Francisco dinner!
I've been wanting to try Stones Throw for a while, on the recommendation of a coworker.  My boyfriend and I found ourselves in the area and came here without a reservation.  We were a little confused, as the door decal and the posted menu said different opening times (5 pm vs 5:30 pm), so we came at 5:35, and were greeted warmly and invited to sit at the bar while the hostess checked if they could accommodate us.  The first thing I noticed here was that they had a fantastic beer selection and a very well thought out decor and motif.  We were seated just a few minutes after we arrived, and service was very fast.  Maybe they were trying to get us out before the first reservation, but I was starving and happy that food was coming as quickly as it did.  YELLOWTAIL & SCALLOP CEVICHEShrimp, Cucumber, Coconut, Jalapeno, Cilantro and rice chips So fresh, and the coconut - which could have either been really bad or really good - was surprisingly great!TAMARIND-GLAZED BEEF RIBEYE Crispy Black Rice, Broccolini, Toasted Garlic, ScallionPresentation was beautiful, with the red meat over the vibrant green sauce.  Seasoning was fantastic and the rice was crispy.BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI Ricotta Gnudi, Brussels Sprout Pesto, Truffle, SageSo delicious!!  The ravioli and gnudi together gave it just enough carby richness.  The brussels sprouts and butternut squash gave it a pop of color.We were too full for dessert, but appreciated the presentation.  They give you a menu with chunky wood pencils, looking like a tree branch with a pencil tip on the end.  They ask you to write your favorite childhood dessert, and if they turn it into a dish on the menu, the chef may ask you to return to try it.  Cute concept.  I love all the thought they put into making Stones Throw a welcoming and consistent place.
I have been looking forward to eating here for months as I had heard great things about this place. The people that work here are so nice but the food itself was a bit of a letdown.We order seven different dishes for 4 people. I don't think any of us walked out full but at the same time we didn't really want to order anything else.Here's the list and breakdown:Puffed Potato & Eggs - The highlight with a nice runny yolk in the middleDuck Pate & Mousse - Pretty standardSquid Ink Conchiglie Pasta - Good but you have to really concentrate to taste the flavorsWarm 'Banh Mi Style' Pork Belly - Good but what pork belly isn't?Grilled Spanish Octopus - Forgettable38 North Duck Breast - Also forgettableRicotta & Nettle Ravioli - StandardAll in all, I think the meal was fine but it was also just so unsurprising for the high-ish price tag it carried.
Came here for brunch this morning. It is a nice trendy restaurant in San Francisco. All of the dishes were good. I was a bit disappointed that they don't have hot chocolate. They only offer coffee, tea, and a bunch of alcoholic beverages. I would highly recommend them adding hot chocolate since people come here for brunch during the weekend and they have a section in their menu dedicated for sweet food items.PUFFED POTATO & EGGS ($8)Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken SkinThis was really good. Loved the combination of all of the ingredients. CINNAMON-SPICED MONKEY BREAD ($14)Bananas, Caramel, Cream Cheese Frosting, Toasted PecansI ordered this dish. So sweet! The bread was soft but the outside part was crispy.DUCK CONFIT HASH ($17)Poached Eggs, Butternut Squash, Brussels Sprouts, Toasted FoccaciaMy boyfriend ordered this dish. I'm a fan of duck so this dish was really good. Everything was perfect. The ingredients went well together. I will definitely come here again for dinner next time. I hope they'll have hot chocolate added in their menu for brunch.
Good dating spot.Service and food are just okay, I couldn't find any impressive here.
This is an easy one. 5 stars for the ambience, the menu, the great service, and of course, the fantastic food!As a Californian/American restaurant, Stones Throw keeps the menu simple. Sharing is caring - the plates are small but if you work your way through the menu you'll get a great variety. Highlights: PUFFED POTATO & EGGS, SAUSAGE STUFFED GRILLED QUAIL, and the TAMARIND-GLAZED BEEF RIBEYE.For the drinks Stones Throw focuses on local wines and German beer.  Extra kudos for the waiter who spoke a little bit of German when I ordered my BERLINER WEISSE MIT SCHUSS - a local classic from Berlin. I was very surprised to find it on the menu.What I especially like about Stones Throw is the attention to detail. You'll find historic references to their food and drinks on the menu, and even the toilet is equipped with a little history on the building. After your dining experience you can leave feedback if you find anything missing from the menu. Neat idea - it's the little things that count.
First thoughts when I walked in was that this was a pretty unique restaurant. There's a bar near the entrance of the restaurant and a tall table for people to stand around, grab a drink, and have a good time. The remaining part of the restaurant had a simple layout; tables that are kind of close to one another (which means that space is limited) and open kitchen (almost as if the chefs are cooking right in front of you). As for the menu, our waitress told us that the reason for the small menu is due to the constant changes and additions that they want to add. However, there are still dishes that have been on the menu since the first day they opened. With that being said, we were surprised by their extensive alcohol menu, which was 2 pages long. The food was overall incredibly delicious and worth trying. I'm not particularly a big fan of New American cuisine, but some of the dishes that were brought out; deconstructed pork belly banh mi, puffed potato and eggs, yellowtail and shrimp ceviche, duck pate and mousse, and 38 north duck breast .The pork belly was cooked perfectly- just the right amount of crisp while maintaining that juiciness from the fat. When paired with the sauces and baguette, all the flavors just come together and what seems as a simple dish, becomes a sensation in your mouth.The puffed potato and eggs melted in your mouth, but for me, I was unable to taste much of the crispy chicken skin. I would highly recommend to start off your meal with the yellowtail and shrimp ceviche because it'll be a refreshing teaser before you begin your meal. It's light, fun, and the yellowtail pairs very well with the acidity from the lime and is balanced by the sweetness from the coconut sauce.The duck pate and mousse was also another unique dish for me as it was my first time trying pate. Order this if you want something a bit more heavy to start off with. Super thick and creamy and comes with two little pretzel rolls.Finally, the 38 north duck breast had only two options to be cooked, medium rare and medium. I didn't know that this was an option for bird meat at all, but the waitress told us that it couldn't be cooked well done because it would become rubbery and wouldn't taste good. Although, it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes, it is worth the recognition for the style of cooking. Overall, our experience was fantastic. We had an amazing waitress who was very helpful and demonstrated her 10 years of experience in the restaurant business exceptionally well. The food was an interesting experience for us; new flavors and the style of cooking.
This place was a last minute decision and I am happy I made it! Prices are correlated to our crazy San Francisco real estate / rental / entertainment market. We shared:Yellowtail and Scallop Ceviche Grilled Spanish Octopus Duo of Beef Ribeye and Braised Short ribEverything was wonderful! Few glasses of wine and this meal made this rainy evening date kinda awesome. Addiing it to my favorites list.
We did a set menu and everything was amazing! The squid ink dish was by far my favorite thing. The flavors were rich and I think I could have eaten just a giant bowl of that.SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens

I also enjoyed the coleslaw that blended quite well with the burger. The tater tots were okay.Ended off the meal with the Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts which was the highlight of the meal. The beignets were light and fluffy (if only they could make them filled!) The peanut butter and jelly with the dish complemented this dessert quite well!Ambiance of the restaurant was more on the casual side as it was pretty loud inside and the tables were pretty close together... Staff was friendly! ~$45/head after tax and tip. There is a ~5% SF Health charge for the wait staff.
This place had more hype than Beyonce's debut album, and both seemed to disappoint to tickle my fancy!?! We had reservations at noon, we arrived about 15mins early and they told us to wait outside for a few mins until a table clears up and then they will call us in.  So we sat outside on a bench like hobos waiting for our name to be called. I see another couple walk in and when we went inside to go check at noon to see if our table was ready, they were seated before us and no our table for 2 is still is not ready, but there's is?!? So we had to wait another 10 mins and this time I just stood right in front of the hostess giving her the "Eastside San Jose death look" so she doesn't give our table away again!?! #SoFrustratingAlso the menu is very simple, not a lot of selection but that is fine as long as the dishes are good "Quality over Quantity" like I always tell my playas.The Original Cup - super gingery if you're into thatSalmon Mousse Dip - really good, best thing we ordered, not enough bread given for the dip amount though so make sure you ask for secondsDuck Confit Entree - dry, small portion, really expensive, disappointmentSpicy Eggs w/Polenta & Pork Belly in Tomato sauce - not really spicy, a-ok, nothing special I don't know playas?...despite all the high Yelp ratings I was not impressed.  The food was like 3.7, the service was like 3.1, I wish I could give it a higher rating but I can't, and I won't, and as Arnold would not say "I won't be back"...
Small menu that changes seasonally. All the dishes we ordered were considerably well prepared and delicious. My favorites: + Puffed Potato and Eggs (cauliflower mousse, chives, crispy chicken skin) + Crispy-skinned trout (celery root, roasted Brussels sprouts, beef jus)
Celebrated my anniversary here with my BF last week! Made a reservation in advance which is a smart idea considering the restaurant is limited in space and takes quite a while to get the food out.We arrived at 8PM on a Tuesday night and were seated right away. The food selection was simple and straightforward while the drink selection was widely diverse. He went with the pizza port and I with a dessert wine to start the dinner. Upon seating, there was a card on the table which I thought was super sweet!Thanks to our fellow Yelpers, we went with the puffed potato and eggs and squid ink pasta for starters and had no regrets. The former had an amazing texture and the flavors exploded in your mouth when you piece the dish together. The squid ink pasta is to die for - it's a must! The seafood flavor developed in the pasta is divine and so fresh. My BF and I agreed that we would order an entree side of this if we can.For entrees, we went with the duck breast and ribeye / shortrib duo. Duck was cooked great and served on top of a bed of grains and ribeye / shortrib duo was tasty but for us, the highlight of the meal was the squid ink pasta hands down. We ended our dinner with complimentary pb&j beignets which was portioned so small we were craving more.We walked here but I assume the parking situation is tough around the area. Bill for the both of us came out to be around $120 with tip and tax. Overall, ambience of this place was wonderful and service was top-notch. The vibe of Stones Throw really embodies San Francisco and I'm so glad we chose to celebrate our special day here away from Los Angeles.
Leave no STONE unturned.My brother kindly took my mom, myself, and some friends to dinner on our last night in the bay area.  I found out that same night that he was wanting to try this restaurant for some time, and he thought a "last supper" with the family was a good reason for an inaugural visit.And about that STONE being unturned, I guess in this case the STONE would be a metaphor for the menu.  My advice:  peruse the menu carefully as there are certainly many appetizing dishes to choose from.The restaurant is cozy, yet elegant and simply decorated.  Though we were slightly early for our reservation, the host extended a warm welcome and showed our group of five to our table.Some of the group did their due diligence in researching (via Yelp) the more popular or well-known dishes.  However, their menu has many appetizers, entrees, etc. to choose from, as well as an extensive wine and spirits list.FOOD:  Thanks to some helpful recommendations via Yelp, our group chose a variety of appetizers to share, these included the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate & mousse, and the squid ink pasta.  Firstly, do order the puffed potato and eggs and the squid ink pasta.  All of the accolades from other yelpers are indeed true.  The potato and eggs are fluffy, light and delicious, while the pasta delivers bold flavors thanks to the seafood combination of calamari, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The duck pate and mousse was alright, and I'd recommend asking for more bread if needed.  My dinner entree was the butternut squash ravioli.  It was simply divine.  Cheesey goodness is more like it actually.  Although the portion was smaller than I anticipated, the gnnochi was excellent.  The brussels sprout pesto, truffle, and sage complemented the ricotta gnudi splendidly.  In contrast, my mother ordered the trout, accompanied with brussels sprouts, celery root and beef jus.  She liked it every much, as evident by her finishing almost the entire portion.I think the entree our table was most in awe of was the burger, or "DA BURGA" as its aptly named on the menu.  This entree is of gargantuan proportions and is every bit as mouthwatering as it looks.....from what I was told by my two tablemates that ordered this behemoth burger.  The burger bun is equally just as thick as the meat that sits between the two pieces, which barely contained the melted cheddar cheese that slowly trickled onto the plate.  And its companion?  Not just your ordinary fries, but baked potato tator tots.  I was able to try a tator tot, and after doing so I began to doubt my original decision to order the gnnochi.  I suppose a second visit is in order on a future trip to the bay area.SWEET TREAT:  To end the meal, we all shared the peanut butter and jelly donuts.  For all my Hawaii friends and family on Yelp, this is basically the bay area's version of malasadas.  The generous portion of jelly within the donut was, of course, a fantastic combination with the peanut butter and truly brought back fond childhood memories.  A comfort food and dessert rolled into one.  SERVICE:  Outstanding.  Our server was a friendly and humorous woman who was extremely patient with our group, and took the time to answer all our questions to the best of her ability.  She kindly offered recommendations on appetizers, entrees, and cocktails.  She checked on us in a timely during the entire meal and provided excellent customer service.  BOTTOM LINE:  An incredible meal with wonderful friends and family.  I'll be back to try "DA BURGA" for sure!!  Those peanut butter and jelly donuts are awesome!
Best dinner I've had in a awhile! This is the sister restaurant of Trestle and it's delicious. I've been here before and got the royal treatment because one of my good friends boyfriends was the chef. Me and a group of 5 friends went on a Saturday night. Initially, I thought my friend had said 9 people were coming and it confused both the hostesses, but there were really nice and able to seat all 5 of us. This place is always packed so reservation are a must. The group ordered 2 appetizers and opted not to order from the small plates section. Although there was a puffed potatoe and egg dish I wanted to try with Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin recommended by the waiter. I will have to try this the next time we go. The 2 appetizer ordered were the squid ink conchiglie pasta with spicy caper, clams, calamari, shrimp, and tender greens and the grilled spanish octopus confit potatoe, white beans, chorizo, raddichio, and saffron aoli. Both appetizer were amazing. I'd have to say that I liked the squid ink pasta the best. I ordered the ricotta and nettle ravioli with english peas, roasted mushrooms, cippolini onions, and beurre blanc. I also loved this dish, but I probably should have paid attention to the fact that there were peas included. I'm not the biggest fan of peas, but this dish had the right texture and flavor. Everything we had was great! We ordered the ho hos dessert and that was also amazing! We were trying to share it among 5 people and it was so tough. I wanted to eat the entire thing myself. I recommend this as an authentic San Francisco dinner!
I've been wanting to try Stones Throw for a while, on the recommendation of a coworker.  My boyfriend and I found ourselves in the area and came here without a reservation.  We were a little confused, as the door decal and the posted menu said different opening times (5 pm vs 5:30 pm), so we came at 5:35, and were greeted warmly and invited to sit at the bar while the hostess checked if they could accommodate us.  The first thing I noticed here was that they had a fantastic beer selection and a very well thought out decor and motif.  We were seated just a few minutes after we arrived, and service was very fast.  Maybe they were trying to get us out before the first reservation, but I was starving and happy that food was coming as quickly as it did.  YELLOWTAIL & SCALLOP CEVICHEShrimp, Cucumber, Coconut, Jalapeno, Cilantro and rice chips So fresh, and the coconut - which could have either been really bad or really good - was surprisingly great!TAMARIND-GLAZED BEEF RIBEYE Crispy Black Rice, Broccolini, Toasted Garlic, ScallionPresentation was beautiful, with the red meat over the vibrant green sauce.  Seasoning was fantastic and the rice was crispy.BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI Ricotta Gnudi, Brussels Sprout Pesto, Truffle, SageSo delicious!!  The ravioli and gnudi together gave it just enough carby richness.  The brussels sprouts and butternut squash gave it a pop of color.We were too full for dessert, but appreciated the presentation.  They give you a menu with chunky wood pencils, looking like a tree branch with a pencil tip on the end.  They ask you to write your favorite childhood dessert, and if they turn it into a dish on the menu, the chef may ask you to return to try it.  Cute concept.  I love all the thought they put into making Stones Throw a welcoming and consistent place.
I have been looking forward to eating here for months as I had heard great things about this place. The people that work here are so nice but the food itself was a bit of a letdown.We order seven different dishes for 4 people. I don't think any of us walked out full but at the same time we didn't really want to order anything else.Here's the list and breakdown:Puffed Potato & Eggs - The highlight with a nice runny yolk in the middleDuck Pate & Mousse - Pretty standardSquid Ink Conchiglie Pasta - Good but you have to really concentrate to taste the flavorsWarm 'Banh Mi Style' Pork Belly - Good but what pork belly isn't?Grilled Spanish Octopus - Forgettable38 North Duck Breast - Also forgettableRicotta & Nettle Ravioli - StandardAll in all, I think the meal was fine but it was also just so unsurprising for the high-ish price tag it carried.
Came here for brunch this morning. It is a nice trendy restaurant in San Francisco. All of the dishes were good. I was a bit disappointed that they don't have hot chocolate. They only offer coffee, tea, and a bunch of alcoholic beverages. I would highly recommend them adding hot chocolate since people come here for brunch during the weekend and they have a section in their menu dedicated for sweet food items.PUFFED POTATO & EGGS ($8)Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken SkinThis was really good. Loved the combination of all of the ingredients. CINNAMON-SPICED MONKEY BREAD ($14)Bananas, Caramel, Cream Cheese Frosting, Toasted PecansI ordered this dish. So sweet! The bread was soft but the outside part was crispy.DUCK CONFIT HASH ($17)Poached Eggs, Butternut Squash, Brussels Sprouts, Toasted FoccaciaMy boyfriend ordered this dish. I'm a fan of duck so this dish was really good. Everything was perfect. The ingredients went well together. I will definitely come here again for dinner next time. I hope they'll have hot chocolate added in their menu for brunch.
Good dating spot.Service and food are just okay, I couldn't find any impressive here.
This is an easy one. 5 stars for the ambience, the menu, the great service, and of course, the fantastic food!As a Californian/American restaurant, Stones Throw keeps the menu simple. Sharing is caring - the plates are small but if you work your way through the menu you'll get a great variety. Highlights: PUFFED POTATO & EGGS, SAUSAGE STUFFED GRILLED QUAIL, and the TAMARIND-GLAZED BEEF RIBEYE.For the drinks Stones Throw focuses on local wines and German beer.  Extra kudos for the waiter who spoke a little bit of German when I ordered my BERLINER WEISSE MIT SCHUSS - a local classic from Berlin. I was very surprised to find it on the menu.What I especially like about Stones Throw is the attention to detail. You'll find historic references to their food and drinks on the menu, and even the toilet is equipped with a little history on the building. After your dining experience you can leave feedback if you find anything missing from the menu. Neat idea - it's the little things that count.
First thoughts when I walked in was that this was a pretty unique restaurant. There's a bar near the entrance of the restaurant and a tall table for people to stand around, grab a drink, and have a good time. The remaining part of the restaurant had a simple layout; tables that are kind of close to one another (which means that space is limited) and open kitchen (almost as if the chefs are cooking right in front of you). As for the menu, our waitress told us that the reason for the small menu is due to the constant changes and additions that they want to add. However, there are still dishes that have been on the menu since the first day they opened. With that being said, we were surprised by their extensive alcohol menu, which was 2 pages long. The food was overall incredibly delicious and worth trying. I'm not particularly a big fan of New American cuisine, but some of the dishes that were brought out; deconstructed pork belly banh mi, puffed potato and eggs, yellowtail and shrimp ceviche, duck pate and mousse, and 38 north duck breast .The pork belly was cooked perfectly- just the right amount of crisp while maintaining that juiciness from the fat. When paired with the sauces and baguette, all the flavors just come together and what seems as a simple dish, becomes a sensation in your mouth.The puffed potato and eggs melted in your mouth, but for me, I was unable to taste much of the crispy chicken skin. I would highly recommend to start off your meal with the yellowtail and shrimp ceviche because it'll be a refreshing teaser before you begin your meal. It's light, fun, and the yellowtail pairs very well with the acidity from the lime and is balanced by the sweetness from the coconut sauce.The duck pate and mousse was also another unique dish for me as it was my first time trying pate. Order this if you want something a bit more heavy to start off with. Super thick and creamy and comes with two little pretzel rolls.Finally, the 38 north duck breast had only two options to be cooked, medium rare and medium. I didn't know that this was an option for bird meat at all, but the waitress told us that it couldn't be cooked well done because it would become rubbery and wouldn't taste good. Although, it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes, it is worth the recognition for the style of cooking. Overall, our experience was fantastic. We had an amazing waitress who was very helpful and demonstrated her 10 years of experience in the restaurant business exceptionally well. The food was an interesting experience for us; new flavors and the style of cooking.
This place was a last minute decision and I am happy I made it! Prices are correlated to our crazy San Francisco real estate / rental / entertainment market. We shared:Yellowtail and Scallop Ceviche Grilled Spanish Octopus Duo of Beef Ribeye and Braised Short ribEverything was wonderful! Few glasses of wine and this meal made this rainy evening date kinda awesome. Addiing it to my favorites list.
We did a set menu and everything was amazing! The squid ink dish was by far my favorite thing. The flavors were rich and I think I could have eaten just a giant bowl of that.SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens
Before anything, their **Squid Ink Pasta was AMAZING!The whole dining experience was a 4.5 Star. Everything was really good. Service was great. Dim lighting with warm decor. Reservations recommended. **Puffed Potato & Eggs with Cauliflower Mousse was okay. Probably the least favorite dish. Was hoping for a little more flavor and crispier. **Duck Pate & Mousse with Soft Pretzel. WOW!!! The pate was delicious. Perfect blend with the mustard and cornichons. The pretzel was warm and soft. I needed more, delicious! **SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA is made with Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens. It's really the best squid Ink pasta I EVER HAD!! Must try from someone who doesn't really like squid ink before Stones Throw. So much flavor, so good. It was the best dish of the night!!**PORK BELLY - Good texture, good flavor and it was crunchy. Comes with 3 pieces. **Beef Ribeye and Braised Shortribs - Plated with Potatoes, Cabbage, Onion and Chimichurri. I love it because you get a little of both. Steak was cook to its best, medium rare and the rib was soft and tender. Good flavor.As for dessert, we got their Blackberry Crisp, cheesecake. It was super yummy. Not too sweets. Yum!
After reading an article from Zagat about Stones Throw's brunch I decided to check it out on Yelp, to my surprise I had already book marked it!  Looking at the menu + pictures, I decided I had to try it out.  I search on a table for Sunday morning and OMG, they have availability the upcoming weekend.  No, I didn't have to schedule it weeks in advance and no I didn't have to go online at midnight to try to get a table for the next day block (30 or 60). Approximately an hour before our reservations I receive two text messages from them.  First one to double check if our situation had changed and whether or not we were still coming.  And the second one was a tip regarding parking.  They suggested we take an Uber and if we did, it would be 5% off our entire meal!  Woaaa that is sooo cool!  We opted not to take Uber, only because we had several errands we had to run that day.  We will definitely take them up on that offer when we have dinner there.  And trust me, after that brunch... we will have many dinners there.Reservations were at a decent time, 11:30!!  We show up about 25 minutes early, because we're always early.  Luckily they have availability and seat us immediately.  We ordered:** PITCHER OF PIMM'S :: 4/5 stars :: for $20, it's a pretty good deal.  And normally I'd say a pitcher for $20 is a great deal, but the pitcher was FULL of ice and the glasses they brought to pour the PIMM'S in was also full of ice... so it was a bit deceptive.  But it was very refreshing and great compliment to brunch** SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE sans scallions :: 5/5 stars :: so much flavor!  mousse was extremely smooth and the pickled items they added complimented the mousse w/o overpowering it.  I think they also added fried capers, which I love!  It added another level of texture.  The bagel chips were a bit hard, I was worried about my teeth on a couple bites!  :D** DUCK CONFIT HASH :: 5/5 stars :: I don't even know where to begin. This was AHHHH-mazing!  I don't even want to describe it, I know I can't do it justice!  Only one other thing to note, I don't even like English peas, but they made me like it!** "DA BURGA" aka DA DISASTER :: 5/5 stars :: everything was perfect, from the great sauces all the way down to the ooey gooey of the cheese melting down the sides of the patty!  Probably my favorite burger in the city for now.Staff was friendly and perfectly attentive.  I love this place and can't wait to come back for dinner!  Happy eating!
3.5 stars. Stones Throw is the stereotypical yuppie SF restaurant. I'll leave that up to your interpretation :P I recommend sharing the appetizers and avoiding the entrees. Puffed Potato & Eggs: 3 stars Egg yolk inside a fried mashed potato ball. What is there not to love? Unfortunately, I found this to be bland yet salty at the same time. How is that even possible?! Squid Ink Pasta: 4.5 stars Delicious but wish the squid ink flavor was a bit stronger. Duck Pate: 4 stars I found the warm pretzel rolls a weird bread choice to go with the duck pate but the pate itself is pretty on point. The entrees are not worth detailing. We had the duck confit (dry) and some type of steamed white fish (flavorless).
Da burger is da bomb, forealz!I've eaten at this place twice already. The BF and I enjoy this place very much and just about everything on their menu. We do have our favorite; which is "Da burger", but for the most part everything is made very well. The chef's tasting profile is on point in my opinion. This place has over 500+ reviews, and it's just about at 5 stars. I think that tell you a lot. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said.Food was great, it can be pricey, parking totally sucks, service was super friendly and attentive. This place is now one of our favorites, but mainly as the BF's "best tasting burger" he ever had type of thing.
What a unique and special experience! Stones Throw and renowned Chef, Dominique Crenn came together and prepared an incredible 5-course meal and ALL proceeds went to charity!  I've never had an experience quite like this.. "At its best, cooking is an alchemical process that transforms ingredients beyond the simple chemical reactions sparked by heat and cold, oil and acid. The act of cooking is an engagement with tradition, community, time and place. And for me, cooking it poetry". Dominique Crenn. Dominique describes making food as an Art and it is very important to use all 5 senses; seeing, tasting, hearing, touching and smelling, to really understand this art form!. I may not be able to explain and articulate each dish quite as they did, but I can share my experience visually. :) (See photos)Service: Without a hitch! 6 star! ;) They were so knowledgeable about each dish and gave great detail in the preparation. Their professionalism and explanation from each of the Servers was impressive. Food:Pre-course (to cleanse the palate): A white chocolate ball filled with champagne topped with  raspberry gel. Its very delicate and pops in your mouth. (Very cleverly created)  First Course - Spring Pea Salad with smoked trout, brioche and Hen eggSecond Course - Poached Striped Bass, with asparagus, little gems and lemon agrumatoThird Course - Monterey Squid with lardo, potato and smoked ham broth. With fried ink chipsFourth Course - Aged Duck with beets and wild berriesFifth Course - Raspberry Clafoutis - A Lemon curd, angel food cake and crème de violetteThe combination of ingredients made for incredible flavors. There is definitely a science behind their creations, which made the experience and taste utterly amazing!Location: In Mission Hill, in a cute residential area. Street parking available.Price: $76 per person all inclusive (We pre-paid in advance for this special event).We brought 2 bottles of wine which they accommodated. Loved every minute of this place.. I'll be back!
Recently returned for brunch after two years and still enjoyed it!We ordered the Pork Belly Tomato Sauce with Baked Eggs & Avocado Toast ($15) and the Salmon Mousse ($8) along with two glasses of wine. This was the perfect size to share between two people. The mousse was delicious but light and airy, and the baked eggs were super delicious on top of Polenta and the side of avo toast was delightful!Overall, a solid option for brunch fare as well in the Russian Hill area!
Came by with a reservation via OpenTable the other night and was certainly glad that I did as I was seated immediately upon arrival to a full restaurant! Parking in Russian Hill is challenging and the restaurant does offer 5% off your bill for using Uber.The restaurant itself is unique as it's in an older building. There are even a couple standing tables by the door near the bar for a casual meal!Started off with the squid ink conchiglie pasta which was on the salty side. The pasta had a fantastic texture and the seafood tasted fresh!Moved on to the puffed potato & eggs and this one was lackluster. It was sort of bland, although it was unique in the sense that it had an egg yolk inside the puff potato! The cauliflower mousse and crispy chicken skin was a unique add-on to the dish.The spring vegetable salad was very good. Vegetables were fresh and the custard made the salad filling!I was a big fan of Da Burga as the bread was light and fluffy! The burger patty was freshly made and crumbled nicely with the bread. I also enjoyed the coleslaw that blended quite well with the burger. The tater tots were okay.Ended off the meal with the Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts which was the highlight of the meal.

Everything we had was great! We ordered the ho hos dessert and that was also amazing! We were trying to share it among 5 people and it was so tough. I wanted to eat the entire thing myself. I recommend this as an authentic San Francisco dinner!
I've been wanting to try Stones Throw for a while, on the recommendation of a coworker.  My boyfriend and I found ourselves in the area and came here without a reservation.  We were a little confused, as the door decal and the posted menu said different opening times (5 pm vs 5:30 pm), so we came at 5:35, and were greeted warmly and invited to sit at the bar while the hostess checked if they could accommodate us.  The first thing I noticed here was that they had a fantastic beer selection and a very well thought out decor and motif.  We were seated just a few minutes after we arrived, and service was very fast.  Maybe they were trying to get us out before the first reservation, but I was starving and happy that food was coming as quickly as it did.  YELLOWTAIL & SCALLOP CEVICHEShrimp, Cucumber, Coconut, Jalapeno, Cilantro and rice chips So fresh, and the coconut - which could have either been really bad or really good - was surprisingly great!TAMARIND-GLAZED BEEF RIBEYE Crispy Black Rice, Broccolini, Toasted Garlic, ScallionPresentation was beautiful, with the red meat over the vibrant green sauce.  Seasoning was fantastic and the rice was crispy.BUTTERNUT SQUASH RAVIOLI Ricotta Gnudi, Brussels Sprout Pesto, Truffle, SageSo delicious!!  The ravioli and gnudi together gave it just enough carby richness.  The brussels sprouts and butternut squash gave it a pop of color.We were too full for dessert, but appreciated the presentation.  They give you a menu with chunky wood pencils, looking like a tree branch with a pencil tip on the end.  They ask you to write your favorite childhood dessert, and if they turn it into a dish on the menu, the chef may ask you to return to try it.  Cute concept.  I love all the thought they put into making Stones Throw a welcoming and consistent place.
I have been looking forward to eating here for months as I had heard great things about this place. The people that work here are so nice but the food itself was a bit of a letdown.We order seven different dishes for 4 people. I don't think any of us walked out full but at the same time we didn't really want to order anything else.Here's the list and breakdown:Puffed Potato & Eggs - The highlight with a nice runny yolk in the middleDuck Pate & Mousse - Pretty standardSquid Ink Conchiglie Pasta - Good but you have to really concentrate to taste the flavorsWarm 'Banh Mi Style' Pork Belly - Good but what pork belly isn't?Grilled Spanish Octopus - Forgettable38 North Duck Breast - Also forgettableRicotta & Nettle Ravioli - StandardAll in all, I think the meal was fine but it was also just so unsurprising for the high-ish price tag it carried.
Came here for brunch this morning. It is a nice trendy restaurant in San Francisco. All of the dishes were good. I was a bit disappointed that they don't have hot chocolate. They only offer coffee, tea, and a bunch of alcoholic beverages. I would highly recommend them adding hot chocolate since people come here for brunch during the weekend and they have a section in their menu dedicated for sweet food items.PUFFED POTATO & EGGS ($8)Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken SkinThis was really good. Loved the combination of all of the ingredients. CINNAMON-SPICED MONKEY BREAD ($14)Bananas, Caramel, Cream Cheese Frosting, Toasted PecansI ordered this dish. So sweet! The bread was soft but the outside part was crispy.DUCK CONFIT HASH ($17)Poached Eggs, Butternut Squash, Brussels Sprouts, Toasted FoccaciaMy boyfriend ordered this dish. I'm a fan of duck so this dish was really good. Everything was perfect. The ingredients went well together. I will definitely come here again for dinner next time. I hope they'll have hot chocolate added in their menu for brunch.
Good dating spot.Service and food are just okay, I couldn't find any impressive here.
This is an easy one. 5 stars for the ambience, the menu, the great service, and of course, the fantastic food!As a Californian/American restaurant, Stones Throw keeps the menu simple. Sharing is caring - the plates are small but if you work your way through the menu you'll get a great variety. Highlights: PUFFED POTATO & EGGS, SAUSAGE STUFFED GRILLED QUAIL, and the TAMARIND-GLAZED BEEF RIBEYE.For the drinks Stones Throw focuses on local wines and German beer.  Extra kudos for the waiter who spoke a little bit of German when I ordered my BERLINER WEISSE MIT SCHUSS - a local classic from Berlin. I was very surprised to find it on the menu.What I especially like about Stones Throw is the attention to detail. You'll find historic references to their food and drinks on the menu, and even the toilet is equipped with a little history on the building. After your dining experience you can leave feedback if you find anything missing from the menu. Neat idea - it's the little things that count.
First thoughts when I walked in was that this was a pretty unique restaurant. There's a bar near the entrance of the restaurant and a tall table for people to stand around, grab a drink, and have a good time. The remaining part of the restaurant had a simple layout; tables that are kind of close to one another (which means that space is limited) and open kitchen (almost as if the chefs are cooking right in front of you). As for the menu, our waitress told us that the reason for the small menu is due to the constant changes and additions that they want to add. However, there are still dishes that have been on the menu since the first day they opened. With that being said, we were surprised by their extensive alcohol menu, which was 2 pages long. The food was overall incredibly delicious and worth trying. I'm not particularly a big fan of New American cuisine, but some of the dishes that were brought out; deconstructed pork belly banh mi, puffed potato and eggs, yellowtail and shrimp ceviche, duck pate and mousse, and 38 north duck breast .The pork belly was cooked perfectly- just the right amount of crisp while maintaining that juiciness from the fat. When paired with the sauces and baguette, all the flavors just come together and what seems as a simple dish, becomes a sensation in your mouth.The puffed potato and eggs melted in your mouth, but for me, I was unable to taste much of the crispy chicken skin. I would highly recommend to start off your meal with the yellowtail and shrimp ceviche because it'll be a refreshing teaser before you begin your meal. It's light, fun, and the yellowtail pairs very well with the acidity from the lime and is balanced by the sweetness from the coconut sauce.The duck pate and mousse was also another unique dish for me as it was my first time trying pate. Order this if you want something a bit more heavy to start off with. Super thick and creamy and comes with two little pretzel rolls.Finally, the 38 north duck breast had only two options to be cooked, medium rare and medium. I didn't know that this was an option for bird meat at all, but the waitress told us that it couldn't be cooked well done because it would become rubbery and wouldn't taste good. Although, it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes, it is worth the recognition for the style of cooking. Overall, our experience was fantastic. We had an amazing waitress who was very helpful and demonstrated her 10 years of experience in the restaurant business exceptionally well. The food was an interesting experience for us; new flavors and the style of cooking.
This place was a last minute decision and I am happy I made it! Prices are correlated to our crazy San Francisco real estate / rental / entertainment market. We shared:Yellowtail and Scallop Ceviche Grilled Spanish Octopus Duo of Beef Ribeye and Braised Short ribEverything was wonderful! Few glasses of wine and this meal made this rainy evening date kinda awesome. Addiing it to my favorites list.
We did a set menu and everything was amazing! The squid ink dish was by far my favorite thing. The flavors were rich and I think I could have eaten just a giant bowl of that.SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens
Before anything, their **Squid Ink Pasta was AMAZING!The whole dining experience was a 4.5 Star. Everything was really good. Service was great. Dim lighting with warm decor. Reservations recommended. **Puffed Potato & Eggs with Cauliflower Mousse was okay. Probably the least favorite dish. Was hoping for a little more flavor and crispier. **Duck Pate & Mousse with Soft Pretzel. WOW!!! The pate was delicious. Perfect blend with the mustard and cornichons. The pretzel was warm and soft. I needed more, delicious! **SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA is made with Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Shrimp, Tender Greens. It's really the best squid Ink pasta I EVER HAD!! Must try from someone who doesn't really like squid ink before Stones Throw. So much flavor, so good. It was the best dish of the night!!**PORK BELLY - Good texture, good flavor and it was crunchy. Comes with 3 pieces. **Beef Ribeye and Braised Shortribs - Plated with Potatoes, Cabbage, Onion and Chimichurri. I love it because you get a little of both. Steak was cook to its best, medium rare and the rib was soft and tender. Good flavor.As for dessert, we got their Blackberry Crisp, cheesecake. It was super yummy. Not too sweets. Yum!
After reading an article from Zagat about Stones Throw's brunch I decided to check it out on Yelp, to my surprise I had already book marked it!  Looking at the menu + pictures, I decided I had to try it out.  I search on a table for Sunday morning and OMG, they have availability the upcoming weekend.  No, I didn't have to schedule it weeks in advance and no I didn't have to go online at midnight to try to get a table for the next day block (30 or 60). Approximately an hour before our reservations I receive two text messages from them.  First one to double check if our situation had changed and whether or not we were still coming.  And the second one was a tip regarding parking.  They suggested we take an Uber and if we did, it would be 5% off our entire meal!  Woaaa that is sooo cool!  We opted not to take Uber, only because we had several errands we had to run that day.  We will definitely take them up on that offer when we have dinner there.  And trust me, after that brunch... we will have many dinners there.Reservations were at a decent time, 11:30!!  We show up about 25 minutes early, because we're always early.  Luckily they have availability and seat us immediately.  We ordered:** PITCHER OF PIMM'S :: 4/5 stars :: for $20, it's a pretty good deal.  And normally I'd say a pitcher for $20 is a great deal, but the pitcher was FULL of ice and the glasses they brought to pour the PIMM'S in was also full of ice... so it was a bit deceptive.  But it was very refreshing and great compliment to brunch** SMOKED SALMON MOUSSE sans scallions :: 5/5 stars :: so much flavor!  mousse was extremely smooth and the pickled items they added complimented the mousse w/o overpowering it.  I think they also added fried capers, which I love!  It added another level of texture.  The bagel chips were a bit hard, I was worried about my teeth on a couple bites!  :D** DUCK CONFIT HASH :: 5/5 stars :: I don't even know where to begin. This was AHHHH-mazing!  I don't even want to describe it, I know I can't do it justice!  Only one other thing to note, I don't even like English peas, but they made me like it!** "DA BURGA" aka DA DISASTER :: 5/5 stars :: everything was perfect, from the great sauces all the way down to the ooey gooey of the cheese melting down the sides of the patty!  Probably my favorite burger in the city for now.Staff was friendly and perfectly attentive.  I love this place and can't wait to come back for dinner!  Happy eating!
3.5 stars. Stones Throw is the stereotypical yuppie SF restaurant. I'll leave that up to your interpretation :P I recommend sharing the appetizers and avoiding the entrees. Puffed Potato & Eggs: 3 stars Egg yolk inside a fried mashed potato ball. What is there not to love? Unfortunately, I found this to be bland yet salty at the same time. How is that even possible?! Squid Ink Pasta: 4.5 stars Delicious but wish the squid ink flavor was a bit stronger. Duck Pate: 4 stars I found the warm pretzel rolls a weird bread choice to go with the duck pate but the pate itself is pretty on point. The entrees are not worth detailing. We had the duck confit (dry) and some type of steamed white fish (flavorless).
Da burger is da bomb, forealz!I've eaten at this place twice already. The BF and I enjoy this place very much and just about everything on their menu. We do have our favorite; which is "Da burger", but for the most part everything is made very well. The chef's tasting profile is on point in my opinion. This place has over 500+ reviews, and it's just about at 5 stars. I think that tell you a lot. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said.Food was great, it can be pricey, parking totally sucks, service was super friendly and attentive. This place is now one of our favorites, but mainly as the BF's "best tasting burger" he ever had type of thing.
What a unique and special experience! Stones Throw and renowned Chef, Dominique Crenn came together and prepared an incredible 5-course meal and ALL proceeds went to charity!  I've never had an experience quite like this.. "At its best, cooking is an alchemical process that transforms ingredients beyond the simple chemical reactions sparked by heat and cold, oil and acid. The act of cooking is an engagement with tradition, community, time and place. And for me, cooking it poetry". Dominique Crenn. Dominique describes making food as an Art and it is very important to use all 5 senses; seeing, tasting, hearing, touching and smelling, to really understand this art form!. I may not be able to explain and articulate each dish quite as they did, but I can share my experience visually. :) (See photos)Service: Without a hitch! 6 star! ;) They were so knowledgeable about each dish and gave great detail in the preparation. Their professionalism and explanation from each of the Servers was impressive. Food:Pre-course (to cleanse the palate): A white chocolate ball filled with champagne topped with  raspberry gel. Its very delicate and pops in your mouth. (Very cleverly created)  First Course - Spring Pea Salad with smoked trout, brioche and Hen eggSecond Course - Poached Striped Bass, with asparagus, little gems and lemon agrumatoThird Course - Monterey Squid with lardo, potato and smoked ham broth. With fried ink chipsFourth Course - Aged Duck with beets and wild berriesFifth Course - Raspberry Clafoutis - A Lemon curd, angel food cake and crème de violetteThe combination of ingredients made for incredible flavors. There is definitely a science behind their creations, which made the experience and taste utterly amazing!Location: In Mission Hill, in a cute residential area. Street parking available.Price: $76 per person all inclusive (We pre-paid in advance for this special event).We brought 2 bottles of wine which they accommodated. Loved every minute of this place.. I'll be back!
Recently returned for brunch after two years and still enjoyed it!We ordered the Pork Belly Tomato Sauce with Baked Eggs & Avocado Toast ($15) and the Salmon Mousse ($8) along with two glasses of wine. This was the perfect size to share between two people. The mousse was delicious but light and airy, and the baked eggs were super delicious on top of Polenta and the side of avo toast was delightful!Overall, a solid option for brunch fare as well in the Russian Hill area!
Came by with a reservation via OpenTable the other night and was certainly glad that I did as I was seated immediately upon arrival to a full restaurant! Parking in Russian Hill is challenging and the restaurant does offer 5% off your bill for using Uber.The restaurant itself is unique as it's in an older building. There are even a couple standing tables by the door near the bar for a casual meal!Started off with the squid ink conchiglie pasta which was on the salty side. The pasta had a fantastic texture and the seafood tasted fresh!Moved on to the puffed potato & eggs and this one was lackluster. It was sort of bland, although it was unique in the sense that it had an egg yolk inside the puff potato! The cauliflower mousse and crispy chicken skin was a unique add-on to the dish.The spring vegetable salad was very good. Vegetables were fresh and the custard made the salad filling!I was a big fan of Da Burga as the bread was light and fluffy! The burger patty was freshly made and crumbled nicely with the bread. I also enjoyed the coleslaw that blended quite well with the burger. The tater tots were okay.Ended off the meal with the Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts which was the highlight of the meal. The beignets were light and fluffy (if only they could make them filled!) The peanut butter and jelly with the dish complemented this dessert quite well!Ambiance of the restaurant was more on the casual side as it was pretty loud inside and the tables were pretty close together... Staff was friendly! ~$45/head after tax and tip. There is a ~5% SF Health charge for the wait staff.
This place had more hype than Beyonce's debut album, and both seemed to disappoint to tickle my fancy!?! We had reservations at noon, we arrived about 15mins early and they told us to wait outside for a few mins until a table clears up and then they will call us in.  So we sat outside on a bench like hobos waiting for our name to be called. I see another couple walk in and when we went inside to go check at noon to see if our table was ready, they were seated before us and no our table for 2 is still is not ready, but there's is?!? So we had to wait another 10 mins and this time I just stood right in front of the hostess giving her the "Eastside San Jose death look" so she doesn't give our table away again!?! #SoFrustratingAlso the menu is very simple, not a lot of selection but that is fine as long as the dishes are good "Quality over Quantity" like I always tell my playas.The Original Cup - super gingery if you're into thatSalmon Mousse Dip - really good, best thing we ordered, not enough bread given for the dip amount though so make sure you ask for secondsDuck Confit Entree - dry, small portion, really expensive, disappointmentSpicy Eggs w/Polenta & Pork Belly in Tomato sauce - not really spicy, a-ok, nothing special I don't know playas?...despite all the high Yelp ratings I was not impressed.  The food was like 3.7, the service was like 3.1, I wish I could give it a higher rating but I can't, and I won't, and as Arnold would not say "I won't be back"...
Small menu that changes seasonally. All the dishes we ordered were considerably well prepared and delicious. My favorites: + Puffed Potato and Eggs (cauliflower mousse, chives, crispy chicken skin) + Crispy-skinned trout (celery root, roasted Brussels sprouts, beef jus)
Celebrated my anniversary here with my BF last week! Made a reservation in advance which is a smart idea considering the restaurant is limited in space and takes quite a while to get the food out.We arrived at 8PM on a Tuesday night and were seated right away. The food selection was simple and straightforward while the drink selection was widely diverse. He went with the pizza port and I with a dessert wine to start the dinner. Upon seating, there was a card on the table which I thought was super sweet!Thanks to our fellow Yelpers, we went with the puffed potato and eggs and squid ink pasta for starters and had no regrets. The former had an amazing texture and the flavors exploded in your mouth when you piece the dish together. The squid ink pasta is to die for - it's a must! The seafood flavor developed in the pasta is divine and so fresh. My BF and I agreed that we would order an entree side of this if we can.For entrees, we went with the duck breast and ribeye / shortrib duo. Duck was cooked great and served on top of a bed of grains and ribeye / shortrib duo was tasty but for us, the highlight of the meal was the squid ink pasta hands down. We ended our dinner with complimentary pb&j beignets which was portioned so small we were craving more.We walked here but I assume the parking situation is tough around the area. Bill for the both of us came out to be around $120 with tip and tax. Overall, ambience of this place was wonderful and service was top-notch. The vibe of Stones Throw really embodies San Francisco and I'm so glad we chose to celebrate our special day here away from Los Angeles.
Leave no STONE unturned.My brother kindly took my mom, myself, and some friends to dinner on our last night in the bay area.  I found out that same night that he was wanting to try this restaurant for some time, and he thought a "last supper" with the family was a good reason for an inaugural visit.And about that STONE being unturned, I guess in this case the STONE would be a metaphor for the menu.  My advice:  peruse the menu carefully as there are certainly many appetizing dishes to choose from.The restaurant is cozy, yet elegant and simply decorated.  Though we were slightly early for our reservation, the host extended a warm welcome and showed our group of five to our table.Some of the group did their due diligence in researching (via Yelp) the more popular or well-known dishes.  However, their menu has many appetizers, entrees, etc. to choose from, as well as an extensive wine and spirits list.FOOD:  Thanks to some helpful recommendations via Yelp, our group chose a variety of appetizers to share, these included the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate & mousse, and the squid ink pasta.  Firstly, do order the puffed potato and eggs and the squid ink pasta.  All of the accolades from other yelpers are indeed true.  The potato and eggs are fluffy, light and delicious, while the pasta delivers bold flavors thanks to the seafood combination of calamari, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The duck pate and mousse was alright, and I'd recommend asking for more bread if needed.  My dinner entree was the butternut squash ravioli.  It was simply divine.  Cheesey goodness is more like it actually.  Although the portion was smaller than I anticipated, the gnnochi was excellent.  The brussels sprout pesto, truffle, and sage complemented the ricotta gnudi splendidly.  In contrast, my mother ordered the trout, accompanied with brussels sprouts, celery root and beef jus.  She liked it every much, as evident by her finishing almost the entire portion.I think the entree our table was most in awe of was the burger, or "DA BURGA" as its aptly named on the menu.  This entree is of gargantuan proportions and is every bit as mouthwatering as it looks.....from what I was told by my two tablemates that ordered this behemoth burger.  The burger bun is equally just as thick as the meat that sits between the two pieces, which barely contained the melted cheddar cheese that slowly trickled onto the plate.  And its companion?  Not just your ordinary fries, but baked potato tator tots.  I was able to try a tator tot, and after doing so I began to doubt my original decision to order the gnnochi.  I suppose a second visit is in order on a future trip to the bay area.SWEET TREAT:  To end the meal, we all shared the peanut butter and jelly donuts.  For all my Hawaii friends and family on Yelp, this is basically the bay area's version of malasadas.  The generous portion of jelly within the donut was, of course, a fantastic combination with the peanut butter and truly brought back fond childhood memories.  A comfort food and dessert rolled into one.  SERVICE:  Outstanding.  Our server was a friendly and humorous woman who was extremely patient with our group, and took the time to answer all our questions to the best of her ability.  She kindly offered recommendations on appetizers, entrees, and cocktails.  She checked on us in a timely during the entire meal and provided excellent customer service.  BOTTOM LINE:  An incredible meal with wonderful friends and family.  I'll be back to try "DA BURGA" for sure!!  Those peanut butter and jelly donuts are awesome!
Best dinner I've had in a awhile! This is the sister restaurant of Trestle and it's delicious. I've been here before and got the royal treatment because one of my good friends boyfriends was the chef. Me and a group of 5 friends went on a Saturday night. Initially, I thought my friend had said 9 people were coming and it confused both the hostesses, but there were really nice and able to seat all 5 of us. This place is always packed so reservation are a must. The group ordered 2 appetizers and opted not to order from the small plates section. Although there was a puffed potatoe and egg dish I wanted to try with Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin recommended by the waiter. I will have to try this the next time we go. The 2 appetizer ordered were the squid ink conchiglie pasta with spicy caper, clams, calamari, shrimp, and tender greens and the grilled spanish octopus confit potatoe, white beans, chorizo, raddichio, and saffron aoli. Both appetizer were amazing. I'd have to say that I liked the squid ink pasta the best. I ordered the ricotta and nettle ravioli with english peas, roasted mushrooms, cippolini onions, and beurre blanc. I also loved this dish, but I probably should have paid attention to the fact that there were peas included. I'm not the biggest fan of peas, but this dish had the right texture and flavor. Everything we had was great! We ordered the ho hos dessert and that was also amazing! We were trying to share it among 5 people and it was so tough. I wanted to eat the entire thing myself.
