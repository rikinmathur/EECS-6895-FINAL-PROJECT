Damn good. DAMN GOOD. I had a falafel sandwich made on pita with home made falafel and it's one of the best I've ever had. Shared it with the g.f. and she had the "brisket burger": which tasted a little different than their standard but quite tasty.I'd order that falafel every week if the place was closer. GOod service, clean restaurant.
3.75It was dinner time and I wasn't really hungry but I knew I had to eat something.  What's good at any time of the day?  Fries.  The look on the servers face was priceless as I sat there, inside a gourmet burger place and just ordered fries.  Like wtf?Mushroom burger, no onions - perhaps the onions would've given this burger more flavor as it was a bit bland and dryCurly Fries and Skinny Fries - the skinny fries were okay, should've added some seasoning.  The curly fries were delicious.  Somehow the curly ones taste 10x better than the "C" shaped ones.  Make sure you grab a few curly ones before the selfish eater across from you does.
Bleh!I have to agree with the previous reviews the food is very bland.. We started out good, the waitress was very polite the and the food sounded impressive and she talked it up very well. I got the chili cheeseburger, it came out and looked good but the chili was cold, ice cold in some places.11.50 for a burger alone with no sides or drink it should have been spot on. The waitress basically ignored us after the food was brought, so we flagged down another guy and told him the chili was cold. They took it back and made me another burger. It took a little while of course, so the rest of my group had already finished eating by the time I got my burger. This time the chili was steaming hot which was good. The bad thing is it was very bland, the chili and the beef were both tasteless. In the end we got the bill and were charged full price for everything! We didnt complain, just paid up and marked this place a a future no go. It's our first night in San Fran, we walked around a few blocks and this was one of the only places with open tables, now I know why. Oh well lesson learned. 1 star for cleanliness and .5 for the polite service so I rounded it up to 2.
Well.. Hostess Erica is very nice girl. That's why it's 2 stars instead of 1.Burger was bad.. I mean reaaaaally bad! I asked well done and they brought rare. It had blood.. Never coming back again
Barney use to me my favorite burger joint. But I don't understand what happen? After they remodel the place and change the menu, everything went downhill.My friends and I ordered a mushroom burger and bacon burger, also ordered curly fries plus garlic fries. Seems like none of our food has any seasoning. We are thinking, new owners? new chefs? From the burgers to fries, everything was bland. No flavor at all. I was so disappointment, as was my friends. I really miss the old Barney's.
Used to love Barney's...have eaten in Oakland many times.  Haven't eaten @ Chestnut  in a few years. We came in at about 8:45 and  took 40 mins to come out.  Service was really slow...we were one of 3 tables. Fries came out first and we're finished before burgers came.  Burgers were barely warm.  Very unorganized and no knowledge of efficient service. Need a manager to watch over an untrained and lazy staff.So many burger places  nearby and we should have chosen somewhere else.
Solid.When there are so many artisan, grass-fed, gourmet burgers in this town, it can be challenging for some to keep up.Barney's is a trusted stand by.  They use Niman Ranch beef, & while not necessarily being the best burger around, it's hard to imagine being disappointed w anything here.There is one burger on the menu here that did blow me away once, though...The Maui Waui.Oh my goodness.  The grilled pineapple.  The teriyaki glaze.  The Canadian bacon.  It's a masterpiece.I ate the entire thing, & rather unapologetically.Props for offering chicken, turkey, & salmon burgers, too.3 & 1/2 stars.
This was my second time here. It was a on Saturday at noon. The wait staff was very attentive and asked if we were ready to order twice. As always, it was hard to narrow down the abundant choices of burger selections. I chose the Truffle burger and it was so messy good. The cheese was melted so well and the flavors of truffle oil and the nice lettuce made the burger taste so good. I was in truffle heaven. I ordered the curly fries based on the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. Curly fries was excellent being curly and all, crispy, tasty and great flavor on its own or with the ranch sauce. Great sauce by the way.  My friend had ordered the Sunshine burger and truffle fries and she said it was good.  So come to this place if you have a chance. Something for everyone even if you want a hot dog, salad, veggie, they have a lot of different choices.My favorite fries so far are the curly fries and sweet potatoes. I enjoyed my truffle burger and Demi burger. So both times I had great experiences at Barney's.
The name Cow Hollow evokes an image of a remote village in the Appalachian Mountains more than a neighborhood in a busy metropolis like San Francisco. The only cows I encountered were grilled and served on a bun, sorry cows.Barney's strikes a nice balance, not a dive but not too trendy or flashy, they just focus on the food, and it shows. The burgers come in many tasty combinations of toppings, the truffle Parmesan fries are absurdly good, and their milkshakes are the perfect consistency for drinking through a straw rather than with a spoon. They have some decent beer offerings too if you're in the mood. My only minor complaints are my burger was closer to medium than medium-rare and the portion size on the fries was pretty skimpy for sharing. The service was a little slow on the last visit too, odd for a weekday afternoon.Cow Hollow may be the country relation of the better known areas of SF, but that doesn't mean it's some rube from the sticks with no culinary street cred. If you're in the neighborhood with a burger craving, Barney's has the cows you're looking for.
The food is decent at best - the staff is the opposite. Don't bother there's better burger places in the immediate area!
I have not been here in years, so I was excited that they had updated their menu, but deeply disappointed by its poor execution and poor management. We had a reservation and they chose to put us at the only table outside on the patio on a cold night that had a broken heater. Really?! After shivering for about twenty minutes, they moved us to a table inside. As for the food, stick to the burgers, fries, and milkshakes. But I can get good burgers in many other places with better ambience, better parking, and better service. Do not order anything that is battered-fried. The batter is thick and hard and it's like trying to chew through armor. DO NOT order the salads. I had the one with salmon. Not only did they forget my order which they didn't even notice when my group was already almost done and I was still sitting there with nothing, but I had to wait on my "rush" order. The server gave me some lame excuse about "it takes awhile too cook the salmon." Has she ever cooked salmon? When my salad finally arrived, the salmon was all of one millimeter thick, paper thin...and yes, overcooked, super dry, and tasteless. I guess in their "rush," they forgot to salt it. The whole salad was pretty tasteless. I left it pretty much untouched. No comment from the restaurant staff. No acknowledgement of the poor treatment or lousy food. No offer to redeem themselves with comps like not charging me for my disgusting salad which I should have cancelled when they told me they lost the ticket for my salad which I guess was separate from my table's dinner order which included burgers, apps and drinks. Again, plenty of other places to get a good burger or salad. Don't waste your time or money here.
I am so disappointed. I don't know what's going on with my favorite burger joints lately but the service is so so bad.- Waited 5 minutes before I was even acknowledge.- Sat another 10 before I was given a menu.- Took myself asking 3 times for a Diet Coke to actually get one. - As I'm thinking to myself about this blatantly bad service I'm listening to a customer complain to the staff about the awful service.- My burger came out in the wrong bun. What has happened to you Barneys? I drove from San Mateo for this burger and let me tell you it's not worth the traffic.The only reason you get these two stars is because you make a decent burger.You need...need more staff. It's ridiculous that a customer must come to the front to place their order or ask for their check because you are too busy.Get it together.
Best burgers around hands down, without being greasy!! Good fries, curly fries are on point. I like how they make their own sauces. My favorite is the Voo-doo sauce, I drench my burger in it so good n spicy!! The service and the beers are great! What else can you ask for?? I found this place by accidentally trying the "pho" next door at the Vietnamese restaurant. I was disappointed, I looked over at the tables outside Barneys and saw this MONSTER BURGER on some guys plate. I ate the pho just so sad, then we went to Barneys and split a burger to satisfy our hunger! So glad we did! Barneys is habit forming for sure and my favorite place to grab grub on the marina.
They were great burgers excellent shakes good service and they give us money to feed the meter they were so nice can't wait to come back
Omg! I just tackled the animal burger and it was awesome! First burger I ever had to eat with a knife an fork. There's just no lifting it off of the plate
Voodoo burger was so amazing. Creamy, spicy sauce with the mushrooms and the bacon complimenting well.
Overall this place was okay. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I might stop by if it was already close.The food was decent, but underwhelming. I got the Santa Fe burger with a side of fries. It was a good size, but under seasoned and pretty bland. The burger came topped with grilled jalapeños and onions which were also somewhat bland. Fries were hot and tasty at least!The restaurant itself was really clean and pretty inside. There's also a back patio which is a plus.
Food has been consistently good. But this review isn't for the food but the safety of restaurant patrons frequenting Barney's.  We sat at the outdoor patio area where there are benches with no backrests ( there is a wooden wall which is about a foot and half from the benches which doubles as a backrest). That huge gap between the seat and the back rest-Hello!!!! safety hazard and not according to safety code. My 3 year old was sitting on the bench eating her meal when she wanted to lean back against the back wall/backrest and she fell right through!!!! She hurt herself pretty bad with bruises on her knees, chin and arms. The gap is unleveled and so big that a small kid can fall right through it. When we questioned a few waiters, they mentioned the only way to get the owner to listen is for me to write a yelp review and that they have repeatedly told him to fix this issue. OWNER OF THIS RESTAURANT------LISTEN TO YOUR EMPLOYEES AND FIX THIS SAFETY ISSUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definitely on the pricey side, but I love their salads!  I get the kale salad or beach body salad with a garden patty and the avocado vinaigrette dressing.  So yummy.
I want to first say that I am a huge fan of Barney's. Being an Oakland kid, I went to Barney's all the time. They always had great fries and yummy burgers. I have never had a bad experience until I went to the Barney's on Steiner. Since recently going gluten free, I've had difficulties finding tasting alternatives at the restaurants I love but I was excited to see that Barney's had a gluten free bun ($1 extra). A waiter came and I ordered their new salmon fillet burger and asked for a gluten free bun and no aioli or fried onion on the burger (both glutinous). My partner ordered their new demi glaze mushroom burger. The burgers arrived with a different waiter: My partner's with a whole wheat-looking bun (he didn't order that) and mine with a regular bun, aioli and fried onion on top. The waiter apologized and went to fix it while my partner suffered through what he thought was a whole wheat bun (it was in fact a gluten free bun). He ended up discarded the bun and just getting the meat which was really good on it's own.I waited a very long and hungry time until another waiter came back with my order: now on a gluten free bun but still with fried onion. I gave up, gave the onions to my partner and started eating. The salmon was completely dry and the gluten free bun was awful. I've had really great gluten free buns and I think Barney's can find some better ones.Our original waiter came by with the check and hoped we had a good meal. He seemed to be oblivious as to what had happened. He also accidentally ran our card for another bill, which he then voided. I know mistakes happen but after everything that happened, we were just done. I sincerely hope this was just one instance of a bad meal at Barney's since it's always been so good!
Damn good. DAMN GOOD. I had a falafel sandwich made on pita with home made falafel and it's one of the best I've ever had. Shared it with the g.f. and she had the "brisket burger": which tasted a little different than their standard but quite tasty.I'd order that falafel every week if the place was closer.

I don't know what's going on with my favorite burger joints lately but the service is so so bad.- Waited 5 minutes before I was even acknowledge.- Sat another 10 before I was given a menu.- Took myself asking 3 times for a Diet Coke to actually get one. - As I'm thinking to myself about this blatantly bad service I'm listening to a customer complain to the staff about the awful service.- My burger came out in the wrong bun. What has happened to you Barneys? I drove from San Mateo for this burger and let me tell you it's not worth the traffic.The only reason you get these two stars is because you make a decent burger.You need...need more staff. It's ridiculous that a customer must come to the front to place their order or ask for their check because you are too busy.Get it together.
Best burgers around hands down, without being greasy!! Good fries, curly fries are on point. I like how they make their own sauces. My favorite is the Voo-doo sauce, I drench my burger in it so good n spicy!! The service and the beers are great! What else can you ask for?? I found this place by accidentally trying the "pho" next door at the Vietnamese restaurant. I was disappointed, I looked over at the tables outside Barneys and saw this MONSTER BURGER on some guys plate. I ate the pho just so sad, then we went to Barneys and split a burger to satisfy our hunger! So glad we did! Barneys is habit forming for sure and my favorite place to grab grub on the marina.
They were great burgers excellent shakes good service and they give us money to feed the meter they were so nice can't wait to come back
Omg! I just tackled the animal burger and it was awesome! First burger I ever had to eat with a knife an fork. There's just no lifting it off of the plate
Voodoo burger was so amazing. Creamy, spicy sauce with the mushrooms and the bacon complimenting well.
Overall this place was okay. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I might stop by if it was already close.The food was decent, but underwhelming. I got the Santa Fe burger with a side of fries. It was a good size, but under seasoned and pretty bland. The burger came topped with grilled jalapeños and onions which were also somewhat bland. Fries were hot and tasty at least!The restaurant itself was really clean and pretty inside. There's also a back patio which is a plus.
Food has been consistently good. But this review isn't for the food but the safety of restaurant patrons frequenting Barney's.  We sat at the outdoor patio area where there are benches with no backrests ( there is a wooden wall which is about a foot and half from the benches which doubles as a backrest). That huge gap between the seat and the back rest-Hello!!!! safety hazard and not according to safety code. My 3 year old was sitting on the bench eating her meal when she wanted to lean back against the back wall/backrest and she fell right through!!!! She hurt herself pretty bad with bruises on her knees, chin and arms. The gap is unleveled and so big that a small kid can fall right through it. When we questioned a few waiters, they mentioned the only way to get the owner to listen is for me to write a yelp review and that they have repeatedly told him to fix this issue. OWNER OF THIS RESTAURANT------LISTEN TO YOUR EMPLOYEES AND FIX THIS SAFETY ISSUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definitely on the pricey side, but I love their salads!  I get the kale salad or beach body salad with a garden patty and the avocado vinaigrette dressing.  So yummy.
I want to first say that I am a huge fan of Barney's. Being an Oakland kid, I went to Barney's all the time. They always had great fries and yummy burgers. I have never had a bad experience until I went to the Barney's on Steiner. Since recently going gluten free, I've had difficulties finding tasting alternatives at the restaurants I love but I was excited to see that Barney's had a gluten free bun ($1 extra). A waiter came and I ordered their new salmon fillet burger and asked for a gluten free bun and no aioli or fried onion on the burger (both glutinous). My partner ordered their new demi glaze mushroom burger. The burgers arrived with a different waiter: My partner's with a whole wheat-looking bun (he didn't order that) and mine with a regular bun, aioli and fried onion on top. The waiter apologized and went to fix it while my partner suffered through what he thought was a whole wheat bun (it was in fact a gluten free bun). He ended up discarded the bun and just getting the meat which was really good on it's own.I waited a very long and hungry time until another waiter came back with my order: now on a gluten free bun but still with fried onion. I gave up, gave the onions to my partner and started eating. The salmon was completely dry and the gluten free bun was awful. I've had really great gluten free buns and I think Barney's can find some better ones.Our original waiter came by with the check and hoped we had a good meal. He seemed to be oblivious as to what had happened. He also accidentally ran our card for another bill, which he then voided. I know mistakes happen but after everything that happened, we were just done. I sincerely hope this was just one instance of a bad meal at Barney's since it's always been so good!
Damn good. DAMN GOOD. I had a falafel sandwich made on pita with home made falafel and it's one of the best I've ever had. Shared it with the g.f. and she had the "brisket burger": which tasted a little different than their standard but quite tasty.I'd order that falafel every week if the place was closer. GOod service, clean restaurant.
3.75It was dinner time and I wasn't really hungry but I knew I had to eat something.  What's good at any time of the day?  Fries.  The look on the servers face was priceless as I sat there, inside a gourmet burger place and just ordered fries.  Like wtf?Mushroom burger, no onions - perhaps the onions would've given this burger more flavor as it was a bit bland and dryCurly Fries and Skinny Fries - the skinny fries were okay, should've added some seasoning.  The curly fries were delicious.  Somehow the curly ones taste 10x better than the "C" shaped ones.  Make sure you grab a few curly ones before the selfish eater across from you does.
Bleh!I have to agree with the previous reviews the food is very bland.. We started out good, the waitress was very polite the and the food sounded impressive and she talked it up very well. I got the chili cheeseburger, it came out and looked good but the chili was cold, ice cold in some places.11.50 for a burger alone with no sides or drink it should have been spot on. The waitress basically ignored us after the food was brought, so we flagged down another guy and told him the chili was cold. They took it back and made me another burger. It took a little while of course, so the rest of my group had already finished eating by the time I got my burger. This time the chili was steaming hot which was good. The bad thing is it was very bland, the chili and the beef were both tasteless. In the end we got the bill and were charged full price for everything! We didnt complain, just paid up and marked this place a a future no go. It's our first night in San Fran, we walked around a few blocks and this was one of the only places with open tables, now I know why. Oh well lesson learned. 1 star for cleanliness and .5 for the polite service so I rounded it up to 2.
Well.. Hostess Erica is very nice girl. That's why it's 2 stars instead of 1.Burger was bad.. I mean reaaaaally bad! I asked well done and they brought rare. It had blood.. Never coming back again
Barney use to me my favorite burger joint. But I don't understand what happen? After they remodel the place and change the menu, everything went downhill.My friends and I ordered a mushroom burger and bacon burger, also ordered curly fries plus garlic fries. Seems like none of our food has any seasoning. We are thinking, new owners? new chefs? From the burgers to fries, everything was bland. No flavor at all. I was so disappointment, as was my friends. I really miss the old Barney's.
Used to love Barney's...have eaten in Oakland many times.  Haven't eaten @ Chestnut  in a few years. We came in at about 8:45 and  took 40 mins to come out.  Service was really slow...we were one of 3 tables. Fries came out first and we're finished before burgers came.  Burgers were barely warm.  Very unorganized and no knowledge of efficient service. Need a manager to watch over an untrained and lazy staff.So many burger places  nearby and we should have chosen somewhere else.
Solid.When there are so many artisan, grass-fed, gourmet burgers in this town, it can be challenging for some to keep up.Barney's is a trusted stand by.  They use Niman Ranch beef, & while not necessarily being the best burger around, it's hard to imagine being disappointed w anything here.There is one burger on the menu here that did blow me away once, though...The Maui Waui.Oh my goodness.  The grilled pineapple.  The teriyaki glaze.  The Canadian bacon.  It's a masterpiece.I ate the entire thing, & rather unapologetically.Props for offering chicken, turkey, & salmon burgers, too.3 & 1/2 stars.
This was my second time here. It was a on Saturday at noon. The wait staff was very attentive and asked if we were ready to order twice. As always, it was hard to narrow down the abundant choices of burger selections. I chose the Truffle burger and it was so messy good. The cheese was melted so well and the flavors of truffle oil and the nice lettuce made the burger taste so good. I was in truffle heaven. I ordered the curly fries based on the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. Curly fries was excellent being curly and all, crispy, tasty and great flavor on its own or with the ranch sauce. Great sauce by the way.  My friend had ordered the Sunshine burger and truffle fries and she said it was good.  So come to this place if you have a chance. Something for everyone even if you want a hot dog, salad, veggie, they have a lot of different choices.My favorite fries so far are the curly fries and sweet potatoes. I enjoyed my truffle burger and Demi burger. So both times I had great experiences at Barney's.
The name Cow Hollow evokes an image of a remote village in the Appalachian Mountains more than a neighborhood in a busy metropolis like San Francisco. The only cows I encountered were grilled and served on a bun, sorry cows.Barney's strikes a nice balance, not a dive but not too trendy or flashy, they just focus on the food, and it shows. The burgers come in many tasty combinations of toppings, the truffle Parmesan fries are absurdly good, and their milkshakes are the perfect consistency for drinking through a straw rather than with a spoon. They have some decent beer offerings too if you're in the mood. My only minor complaints are my burger was closer to medium than medium-rare and the portion size on the fries was pretty skimpy for sharing. The service was a little slow on the last visit too, odd for a weekday afternoon.Cow Hollow may be the country relation of the better known areas of SF, but that doesn't mean it's some rube from the sticks with no culinary street cred. If you're in the neighborhood with a burger craving, Barney's has the cows you're looking for.
The food is decent at best - the staff is the opposite. Don't bother there's better burger places in the immediate area!
I have not been here in years, so I was excited that they had updated their menu, but deeply disappointed by its poor execution and poor management. We had a reservation and they chose to put us at the only table outside on the patio on a cold night that had a broken heater. Really?! After shivering for about twenty minutes, they moved us to a table inside. As for the food, stick to the burgers, fries, and milkshakes. But I can get good burgers in many other places with better ambience, better parking, and better service. Do not order anything that is battered-fried. The batter is thick and hard and it's like trying to chew through armor. DO NOT order the salads. I had the one with salmon. Not only did they forget my order which they didn't even notice when my group was already almost done and I was still sitting there with nothing, but I had to wait on my "rush" order. The server gave me some lame excuse about "it takes awhile too cook the salmon." Has she ever cooked salmon? When my salad finally arrived, the salmon was all of one millimeter thick, paper thin...and yes, overcooked, super dry, and tasteless. I guess in their "rush," they forgot to salt it. The whole salad was pretty tasteless. I left it pretty much untouched. No comment from the restaurant staff. No acknowledgement of the poor treatment or lousy food. No offer to redeem themselves with comps like not charging me for my disgusting salad which I should have cancelled when they told me they lost the ticket for my salad which I guess was separate from my table's dinner order which included burgers, apps and drinks. Again, plenty of other places to get a good burger or salad. Don't waste your time or money here.
