Casual lively spot with very reasonably priced food.Seafood pot pie (5/5) - It was highly recommended by the waiter and I can see why. It packed an incredible amount of flavor with lots of seafood. It wasn't at all like a chicken pot pie like the name might conjure. It's probably better thought of as a spicy thick stew of seafood with a flakey dough accompaniment. Very different than anything I was used toService was friendly and fast but not overbearing.
I've come here twice now for birthdays with a large group and think it's okay. Both times I ordered the rotisserie chicken with a side. The chicken is pretty tasty, but I think it's actually pretty pricey for what you get. Truffle mac & cheese is also avg and you have to pay extra if you want it as a side. I just remember walking away both times feeling like my meal wasn't very worth it.The first time we came my bf and I also ordered the ceviche. It was really disappointing - tasted mediocre, tiny amount, and was pretty expensive...I think $20-$30 or something.Overall I think 4.5 stars is overrated and I would lower expectations a bit. Service is really friendly and if it's your birthday they give you free dessert.
Not really the best experience I've had dining in SF.  The decor is okay, not really impressed when I walked in though.  I didn't feel extremely welcomed or excited as I sat at the bar to order a drink and some food.  The bartender was friendly, but kind of occupied with other things most of the time.The general vibe was okay, but not really what you'd expect for the area it is in on a weekend evening.  I ordered the truffle mac and cheese, and wasn't really blow away by it.  It had a slightly off taste, and I didn't even finish it all.Also got the Ceviche mixto, and there really wasn't much to like about it.  The flavors didn't seem to mix well, and it had an almost sour taste to it.  Also did not finish this dish.The desert I had was okay, but once again nothing to write home about.
Came here recently on a date last saturday night. The restaurant is small and seating is limited. Although they can accommodate a few small parties, I wouldn't necessarily recommend la fusion for big groups. If you have a smaller party, do make a reservation. Just note that tables are on the smaller side and may be a bit cramp.Like a majority of the review, La fusion is known for their ceviche and their famous roast chicken. My date and I ended up ordering their ceviche mixto fresh fish, Shrimp, Octopus, Mussels, Pickled Red Onions,  Corn & Lime Juice.It was a great mix, but personally I would have enjoyed a tad bit more citrus in the mix. Nonetheless, good seafood and very fresh. (smaller serving)I would, however, highly recommend the chicken. It was very moist and tender, flavor was perfect. With the entree, you can order between a full, a half, or quarter. It also comes with a side. (get the white bean side, it's delicious). The chicken is also served with a variety of three different sauces. We also tried the lomo saltado, which was tangy and savory at the same time. Both my date and I agreed that the combination of the beef and veggies didn't go quite well with the french fries. I felt like it wouldn't been better with house potatoes or red bell peppers? Though the sous-vied beef was very tender.Overall, i would come back for the chicken. Pretty good meal, perhaps we ordered the wrong items. I believe the 3 items came out to around $70-80
Tiny restaurant tucked away in FiDi with flavors and dishes the pack a PUNCH. I've been here twice now, and was able to try quite a bit of dishes each time. Everything is totally on point! The warm bread salad with all the chicken juices mixed into is under the half chicken (SO FREAKING FLAVORFUL AND JUICEY) we ordered, the mixed ceviche with fish and yummy chewy octopus, the truffle mac was rich and delicious, the sauces the chicken came with, the empanadas, and the cilantro rice. God, I am drooling again just thinking about it. I also heard the ribs were da bomb dot com so I definitely need to try that next time. Its overall a bit pricey for chicken, but honestly the quality of food, service, and ambience maybe might be worth? (kinda mixed feelings about this.) Anyhoo, come try this place especially if you love chicken. it is YUMMMMM.
Came here for another friend's birthday. We were in a group of 12 and just like the previous time, we end up being arranged around a pole. The pole essentially divides the table as this awkward divider. The seafood pot pie and truffle mac & cheese are just as good as I remember. mac & cheese has a strong truffle taste, but it doesn't overpower the entire dish. The pot pie is super flaky with plenty of seafood. Food is more expensive than I remember and there is a 20% mandatory gratuity for larger groups.
Fusion works when intertwining varying foods, drink and cultures, but definitely NOT a fusion of cigar smoke and food.  After scouring Yelp and the web for a great place to dine when in SF for a business and pleasure trip I found La Fusion.  All looked awesome and promising for a casual Saturday night dinner.  We were promptly seated at a very small table at the front of the restaurant, only to find an overpowering smell of cigar smoke coming from the cigar store/bar immediately next door.  Asked to be moved to the back of the restaurant away from the frequently opening front door and open windows on the street, but no other tables were available.  We're outa here.  Also very surprised not to find any cerviche on the menu, a showcase on the menu found on their awful website, leaving a gaping hole in what first excited me about La Fusion.This said, credit goes to the lovely hostess who provided a recommendation to a very nice Italian restaurant nearby.
Full chicken - 3.5/5 - so so, i like limon way more because it was more juicy and had a much crispier skinceviche mixto - 3/5 - ok flavors, was quite small for the price, it came with toast bites, wished it were chipsfried empanadas beef - 3.5/5 - crispy, strong flavor, but not as good as the ones in Perutruffle mac & cheese - 4/5 - pretty good, not bad, small portions though, but one of the tastier mac and cheese i hadsweet potato fries - 4/5 - pretty good actually, kept dipping into the orange sauce, nice and crispytres leches - 2.5/5 - was hard, and had a strong banana taste, what gives? odd, didn't taste freshbanana dulce de leche empanadas - 3.5/5 - didn't taste like bananas surprisingly, crispy, a bit too sweet, but not too bad. it does have mushy bananas inside, but bc it's fried, you can't taste itred sangria - 4/5 - on the sweeter side, can't even taste the alcohol, had 2 full bottle because it's quite small for 4 people..service was ok, bathroom was clean (uni sex), small place, walked passed it, not a bad place, but it's more of OK place.
My cousin who moved from NYC to San Fran, raved about how much she loved the Latin Fusion cuisine in La Fusion. She has stated it is difficult to find authentic Latino cuisine that isn't Mexican and misses the flavors that she adored so much in the fusion places NYC has to offer. We were lucky to get a last minute reservation due to a previous cancellation and I must say that I am so thankful for the ability to have been able to try it! We just made it to our reservation after a long ride back to San Francisco from Napa and were delighted to be seated and served immediately. We started off with Sangria because of course more wine after wine is always great:) The sangria was delicious and had hints of citrus fruits and honey which made it feel quite classy:) Definitely one of the best I have tasted!We were so ready to order food, and had been talking about our choices on our ride from Napa. My friend and I ordered and shared the Yucca Fries at $10 a plate, which came with a choice of three sauces but honestly our favorite was the chimmichurri sauce, with chopped cilantro, lime, and garlic who could go wrong! Then we had the arroz con pollo at $16 a plate, which had the most delicious green cilantro sauce in the rice that put the chimichurri sauce to shame... unless it was the same? The chicken had the rotisserie taste I adore and just such a great blend of Latin flavors! We devoured each bite. We also had Mixed Green Salad which included Cucumbers, Onion, Tomato, Choclo with a Champagne Vinaigrette. The choclo are Peruvian corn nuts which taste just like the corn nuts they sell in a bag and were such a wonderful addition to the salad that gave it a unique twist unlike any salad I have ever tasted. My cousin Is OBSESSED with the Fish Ceviche (Ceviche de Pescado) and wanted me to make sure I RAVED about how INCREDIBLE and unlike anything else she has ever tasted it is! She enjoys the Fresh Fish, Corn Nuts, Pickled Red Onions & Aji Amarillo that are detailed with the fish but most of all the lime and garlic that are included in the seasoning. I had a taste and must say that the flavors are indeed phenomenal but I wasn't a fan of the raw chewy fish. Nonetheless, still great!The only thing I would say is a drawback is that there isn't great ventilation so you will leave smelling like the food, however I think this is kind of charming because it makes you feel like you are at somebody's home who is cooking you a personally catered meal. I must add that my favorite part was seeing the owner doing some serving and watching everyone work as a team. At one point two people came to help our server with the plates. I hate that I forgot her name but she was such a sweet girl who was so attentive that she noticed how much we loved the chimichurri sauce and brought us some more! LOVE THIS PLACE. Will try to come back on the next San Fran visit!
I had La Fusion bookmarked for a while and with such amazing ratings its a must try. Came here with a group of girlfriends. It was a group of 7 girls. I felt like the server were impatient with us. Might be that we only had 6 people there and not complete?. But we did order sangria and appetizers to start before the whole party arrived. I didn't think we held up the process for them. I just didn't like the feeling of being rushed but he was trying to be nice not trying to sound pushy. Other than that, services was very good and the hostess was very nice.We started with the Argentinian Style Baked **Empanada (Beef), **sweet potato and **regular fries. The empandaa was very flavorful, pretty tasty to me but the fries was a bit bland. I guess that is why they give you dipping sauces on the side and it was not crispy. We had the large **Sangria as well. Pretty good but I think it was lots sweeter than ones I had before. Don't get me wrong, I love it sweet but some might disgree. Since we are a group of 7, we did order quite a few items.I got the *SEAFOOD POT PIE because it had such good reviews on yelp. Well, that was a disappointment. I was so excited too. The Pastry Puff was not very crispy, shouldn't it be? The taste of the dish was not bad but I just didn't like my dish so much. It's lacking in something, flavors. Maybe it was the chef that night. I had more fish than anything else from the seafood pot pie. I didn't think it was that good. **Truffle Mac and Cheese sides to share. (2 orders) You can smell and taste the truffles. YUM! **WHOLE CHICKEN  $34. I had a piece of that and I really like that. I should have order the Arroz con Pollo instead of my pie. The chicken was cooked perfect. Juicy and tasty. **Pork Chop served with Bacon and that was very tasty. Was not dry at all and lots of flavor. I would recommend that. **Strips of Beef Tenderloin (stir fry) was not really good. The beef was on the dryer side. **Short ribs - My friend said it was just okay. The meat didn't just fall off. Overall experience was not bad but don't think I will come back for anything other than their chicken.
Gosh I can't love this place more! Me and my roommate found this little restaurant by accident, and it became my new favorite since then~ I went there a many times so far and tried different dishes: Rotisserie Chicken is what we will have for sure every time. It never goes wrong! The meat is tender and moistBread salad is to die for!!! I can literally have this one dish for the rest of my life I swear...... Truffle Mac and cheese is awesome as well, super creamy and delicious, totally worth the calories!
I almost died.It's true.I fell 180 ft down the "Snake Dance" route on Half Dome (that's in Yosemite for you cityfolk), thinking I was on the much easier, and much more traveled "Snake Dike" route.Because of the runout nature of this route, I had no gear or bolts for 90 ft and fell down 90ft and then another 90 ft past my belayer.  Scraping against the high-angle granite, trying to keep my feet in front of me, and hoping the rope was going to catch before I smashed into a ledge.And catch it did.  I'll never forget that tug of life.  My climbing partner literally saved my life. (her hands were pretty badly mangled from absorbing all that energy during the fall :( )This happened two days before my birthday.Two days later I was in San Francisco for job training.My climbing partner and I went here, on my birthday, after we almost died.I guess what I'm saying is: my review is probably a little biased.I was very impressed with the ambiance.  I love the classy, laid-back little hole-in-the-walls that are so common in San Francisco, and so rare almost everywhere else.The staff was great, the hardest part was choosing what to order.I ended up going with lamb.  I never had lamb growing up,and now I can't get enough of it!  It was incredible.Great service, great ambiance, great food, and reasonable prices...I love big cities.I'll never forget this place.
My friends and I came here to celebrate the end of the semester in December and it was so good!!! One of the people in our group came here before and suggested coming here again. We didn't make reservation, and upon arriving, they told us it would be a 45min-1hour wait for a group of 5. I put down my name, and we decided to wander around and see if there were any other restaurants we would want to eat at instead. There's an alleyway around the corner with plenty of restaurants, but none of them seemed to beat La Fusion. We decided to stick to La Fusion and the wait turned out to only be a little less than an hour. We ordered the truffle mac & cheese, empanadas, championeses envueltos, ceviche mixto, and lomo saltado. I'm not a big fan of mac & cheese, but I saw that it was one of their most popular dishes, so I decided to give it a try. I am SO SO SO happy I ordered it! The truffle flavor blended very nicely with the sharpness of the cheese. I'm usually not a fan of mac & cheese because of how heavy it is, but this one was on the lighter side and wasn't overwhelming. The empanadas were also really good and were very crispy. My favorite was the championese envueltos, which is a mushroom strudel that also came with mashed potatoes. My two greatest loves are mushrooms and potatoes, so this was my favorite dish. The sauce inside the strudel was like gravy, and complemented the natural flavors of the mushrooms really well. The mashed potatoes was heavenly...It was so creamy and buttery and fluffy. I felt like I was in a mashed potato cloud as I engulfed a bite. I'm a big lomo saltado fan, and I was very pleased with theirs. The meat was done extremely well; not too rare and not too well done. It was probably the most tender lomo saltado I've ever had. We were still a big hungry, but wasn't sure if we wanted to order another entree, so our server suggested us to try a ceviche. I was skeptical at first because I wasn't sure how fresh their raw seafood was, but I'm glad we went with it! We got the ceviche mixto, which had salsa, shrimp, fish, onions, oyster, garlic, and others. The seafood was really fresh and it came with bread crisps. The food was beyond amazing, and the service was great! 10/10 would recommend coming here if you're in the area! But I would suggest making a reservation.
The short: delicious (and tiny)empanadas I was intimidated by some of the diners who were wearing some suits, but they still take plebeians like me ;) The place is long, extending towards the back, though I'm not sure about the exact size and the capacity because we chose a table at the window next to the entrance.My friend and I decided on the fried empanadas. They are tiny, delicious things and alone are not good for a full meal. My friend wanted something to drink, so the waiter suggested the purple corn drink. I had a taste of it, and despite its strange name, it tastes wonderful! Since the main empanadas were not enough, we shared a dessert banana empanada, which also tasted wonderful.We liked our server, who was very nice. Haha! He was very flirty and my friend and I were giggling the entire time. That purple corn drink my friend ordered? On the house! Thanks good sir!I'm not used to paying so much for such small portions. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind coming back if somebody else was paying or I was earning more heheh.
Chicken with rice, arugula salad and truffle mac and cheese. I didn't love any of the dishes. The chicken was done nicely.Candied walnuts were delicious combined with the dressing in the salad. If you don't mind bitterness from the arugula (it was only remedied by looking for bits of candied walnuts to combine it with) it's a safe bet.I thought the beets could have been flavored in a way that was more complimentary to the salad, they seemed out of place, kind of bland. The truffle oil or overall flavor of the mac and cheese reminded me of when you boil hot dogs - what that hot-dog boiling water would taste like. Guess it wasn't for me. The rice served with the chicken wasn't my thing, there was a weird flavor that wasn't quite tangy.. but was in that realm of flavor. I don't like cilantro, so it makes sense that I wouldn't like the rice, though. My dining partner sometimes doesn't either, but I think my she didn't hate it, as she ate about 1/3 of it. We both enjoyed the chicken, which was flavorful and done nicely.It wasn't horrible, also not a place I'd pick again. I'd go if someone else really wanted to.
Food:Ceviche Mixto...$16....Yummy!!! And a good size portion for an appetizerLa Fusion Seafood Pot Pie...$24....AMAZING!!!! A must try.  Sauce is so good and can also be a dipping sauce for the rotisserie chicken.Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas....$8....Good!!Service:Arrived at the right time, 11:40a.m-ish, right before the lunch time rush.  The server was very attentive, helpful and suggested some favorites.  Overall Experience:Definitely a good one. I'll be back to try other ceviches and other apps IF i'm not going there mainly for the pot pie.
Food is amazing!! Had the half pound chicken with salad and their infamous Mac n Cheese (it's to die for!) and everything tasted amazing! Only downside is no beer on draft and the space is extremely small and it's hard to find! Ended up walking around it twice (full blocks) bc it's so hard to find. Definitely worth coming to for the food though!
Simple decor & lovely food.Would be back soon
I came here with my best friends for a quick snack before we headed to the bars. We had their Empanadas (corn & fish), Yucca Fries, and Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas. I loved the sauces that came with the empanadas, it compliment together very well, my fave sauce was the piquillo pepper aioli. The Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas is a MUST TRY, our waiter recommended it to us and it was delicious!  What can go wrong with bananas and ice cream?I definitely want to come here again and try their truffle mac and cheese and chicken!
This place is like a large hallway plus a kitchen. I sat at the bar and had the lomo saltado and half carate of sangria. They use Panzu sauce for the steak which tasted like a thick soy sauce. It was good, but there was way too much. It overpowered everything else on the plate and the steak alone didn't have much flavor. I've had better lomo saltados before (for example: Fresca). The sangria was good, but for a half pitcher I wasn't even tipsy. The staff here is very friendly though. They make sure to greet everyone upon entrance and they constantly checked in on me and asked how my food was.
Casual lively spot with very reasonably priced food.Seafood pot pie (5/5) - It was highly recommended by the waiter and I can see why. It packed an incredible amount of flavor with lots of seafood.

(her hands were pretty badly mangled from absorbing all that energy during the fall :( )This happened two days before my birthday.Two days later I was in San Francisco for job training.My climbing partner and I went here, on my birthday, after we almost died.I guess what I'm saying is: my review is probably a little biased.I was very impressed with the ambiance.  I love the classy, laid-back little hole-in-the-walls that are so common in San Francisco, and so rare almost everywhere else.The staff was great, the hardest part was choosing what to order.I ended up going with lamb.  I never had lamb growing up,and now I can't get enough of it!  It was incredible.Great service, great ambiance, great food, and reasonable prices...I love big cities.I'll never forget this place.
My friends and I came here to celebrate the end of the semester in December and it was so good!!! One of the people in our group came here before and suggested coming here again. We didn't make reservation, and upon arriving, they told us it would be a 45min-1hour wait for a group of 5. I put down my name, and we decided to wander around and see if there were any other restaurants we would want to eat at instead. There's an alleyway around the corner with plenty of restaurants, but none of them seemed to beat La Fusion. We decided to stick to La Fusion and the wait turned out to only be a little less than an hour. We ordered the truffle mac & cheese, empanadas, championeses envueltos, ceviche mixto, and lomo saltado. I'm not a big fan of mac & cheese, but I saw that it was one of their most popular dishes, so I decided to give it a try. I am SO SO SO happy I ordered it! The truffle flavor blended very nicely with the sharpness of the cheese. I'm usually not a fan of mac & cheese because of how heavy it is, but this one was on the lighter side and wasn't overwhelming. The empanadas were also really good and were very crispy. My favorite was the championese envueltos, which is a mushroom strudel that also came with mashed potatoes. My two greatest loves are mushrooms and potatoes, so this was my favorite dish. The sauce inside the strudel was like gravy, and complemented the natural flavors of the mushrooms really well. The mashed potatoes was heavenly...It was so creamy and buttery and fluffy. I felt like I was in a mashed potato cloud as I engulfed a bite. I'm a big lomo saltado fan, and I was very pleased with theirs. The meat was done extremely well; not too rare and not too well done. It was probably the most tender lomo saltado I've ever had. We were still a big hungry, but wasn't sure if we wanted to order another entree, so our server suggested us to try a ceviche. I was skeptical at first because I wasn't sure how fresh their raw seafood was, but I'm glad we went with it! We got the ceviche mixto, which had salsa, shrimp, fish, onions, oyster, garlic, and others. The seafood was really fresh and it came with bread crisps. The food was beyond amazing, and the service was great! 10/10 would recommend coming here if you're in the area! But I would suggest making a reservation.
The short: delicious (and tiny)empanadas I was intimidated by some of the diners who were wearing some suits, but they still take plebeians like me ;) The place is long, extending towards the back, though I'm not sure about the exact size and the capacity because we chose a table at the window next to the entrance.My friend and I decided on the fried empanadas. They are tiny, delicious things and alone are not good for a full meal. My friend wanted something to drink, so the waiter suggested the purple corn drink. I had a taste of it, and despite its strange name, it tastes wonderful! Since the main empanadas were not enough, we shared a dessert banana empanada, which also tasted wonderful.We liked our server, who was very nice. Haha! He was very flirty and my friend and I were giggling the entire time. That purple corn drink my friend ordered? On the house! Thanks good sir!I'm not used to paying so much for such small portions. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind coming back if somebody else was paying or I was earning more heheh.
Chicken with rice, arugula salad and truffle mac and cheese. I didn't love any of the dishes. The chicken was done nicely.Candied walnuts were delicious combined with the dressing in the salad. If you don't mind bitterness from the arugula (it was only remedied by looking for bits of candied walnuts to combine it with) it's a safe bet.I thought the beets could have been flavored in a way that was more complimentary to the salad, they seemed out of place, kind of bland. The truffle oil or overall flavor of the mac and cheese reminded me of when you boil hot dogs - what that hot-dog boiling water would taste like. Guess it wasn't for me. The rice served with the chicken wasn't my thing, there was a weird flavor that wasn't quite tangy.. but was in that realm of flavor. I don't like cilantro, so it makes sense that I wouldn't like the rice, though. My dining partner sometimes doesn't either, but I think my she didn't hate it, as she ate about 1/3 of it. We both enjoyed the chicken, which was flavorful and done nicely.It wasn't horrible, also not a place I'd pick again. I'd go if someone else really wanted to.
Food:Ceviche Mixto...$16....Yummy!!! And a good size portion for an appetizerLa Fusion Seafood Pot Pie...$24....AMAZING!!!! A must try.  Sauce is so good and can also be a dipping sauce for the rotisserie chicken.Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas....$8....Good!!Service:Arrived at the right time, 11:40a.m-ish, right before the lunch time rush.  The server was very attentive, helpful and suggested some favorites.  Overall Experience:Definitely a good one. I'll be back to try other ceviches and other apps IF i'm not going there mainly for the pot pie.
Food is amazing!! Had the half pound chicken with salad and their infamous Mac n Cheese (it's to die for!) and everything tasted amazing! Only downside is no beer on draft and the space is extremely small and it's hard to find! Ended up walking around it twice (full blocks) bc it's so hard to find. Definitely worth coming to for the food though!
Simple decor & lovely food.Would be back soon
I came here with my best friends for a quick snack before we headed to the bars. We had their Empanadas (corn & fish), Yucca Fries, and Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas. I loved the sauces that came with the empanadas, it compliment together very well, my fave sauce was the piquillo pepper aioli. The Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas is a MUST TRY, our waiter recommended it to us and it was delicious!  What can go wrong with bananas and ice cream?I definitely want to come here again and try their truffle mac and cheese and chicken!
This place is like a large hallway plus a kitchen. I sat at the bar and had the lomo saltado and half carate of sangria. They use Panzu sauce for the steak which tasted like a thick soy sauce. It was good, but there was way too much. It overpowered everything else on the plate and the steak alone didn't have much flavor. I've had better lomo saltados before (for example: Fresca). The sangria was good, but for a half pitcher I wasn't even tipsy. The staff here is very friendly though. They make sure to greet everyone upon entrance and they constantly checked in on me and asked how my food was.
Casual lively spot with very reasonably priced food.Seafood pot pie (5/5) - It was highly recommended by the waiter and I can see why. It packed an incredible amount of flavor with lots of seafood. It wasn't at all like a chicken pot pie like the name might conjure. It's probably better thought of as a spicy thick stew of seafood with a flakey dough accompaniment. Very different than anything I was used toService was friendly and fast but not overbearing.
I've come here twice now for birthdays with a large group and think it's okay. Both times I ordered the rotisserie chicken with a side. The chicken is pretty tasty, but I think it's actually pretty pricey for what you get. Truffle mac & cheese is also avg and you have to pay extra if you want it as a side. I just remember walking away both times feeling like my meal wasn't very worth it.The first time we came my bf and I also ordered the ceviche. It was really disappointing - tasted mediocre, tiny amount, and was pretty expensive...I think $20-$30 or something.Overall I think 4.5 stars is overrated and I would lower expectations a bit. Service is really friendly and if it's your birthday they give you free dessert.
Not really the best experience I've had dining in SF.  The decor is okay, not really impressed when I walked in though.  I didn't feel extremely welcomed or excited as I sat at the bar to order a drink and some food.  The bartender was friendly, but kind of occupied with other things most of the time.The general vibe was okay, but not really what you'd expect for the area it is in on a weekend evening.  I ordered the truffle mac and cheese, and wasn't really blow away by it.  It had a slightly off taste, and I didn't even finish it all.Also got the Ceviche mixto, and there really wasn't much to like about it.  The flavors didn't seem to mix well, and it had an almost sour taste to it.  Also did not finish this dish.The desert I had was okay, but once again nothing to write home about.
Came here recently on a date last saturday night. The restaurant is small and seating is limited. Although they can accommodate a few small parties, I wouldn't necessarily recommend la fusion for big groups. If you have a smaller party, do make a reservation. Just note that tables are on the smaller side and may be a bit cramp.Like a majority of the review, La fusion is known for their ceviche and their famous roast chicken. My date and I ended up ordering their ceviche mixto fresh fish, Shrimp, Octopus, Mussels, Pickled Red Onions,  Corn & Lime Juice.It was a great mix, but personally I would have enjoyed a tad bit more citrus in the mix. Nonetheless, good seafood and very fresh. (smaller serving)I would, however, highly recommend the chicken. It was very moist and tender, flavor was perfect. With the entree, you can order between a full, a half, or quarter. It also comes with a side. (get the white bean side, it's delicious). The chicken is also served with a variety of three different sauces. We also tried the lomo saltado, which was tangy and savory at the same time. Both my date and I agreed that the combination of the beef and veggies didn't go quite well with the french fries. I felt like it wouldn't been better with house potatoes or red bell peppers? Though the sous-vied beef was very tender.Overall, i would come back for the chicken. Pretty good meal, perhaps we ordered the wrong items. I believe the 3 items came out to around $70-80
Tiny restaurant tucked away in FiDi with flavors and dishes the pack a PUNCH. I've been here twice now, and was able to try quite a bit of dishes each time. Everything is totally on point! The warm bread salad with all the chicken juices mixed into is under the half chicken (SO FREAKING FLAVORFUL AND JUICEY) we ordered, the mixed ceviche with fish and yummy chewy octopus, the truffle mac was rich and delicious, the sauces the chicken came with, the empanadas, and the cilantro rice. God, I am drooling again just thinking about it. I also heard the ribs were da bomb dot com so I definitely need to try that next time. Its overall a bit pricey for chicken, but honestly the quality of food, service, and ambience maybe might be worth? (kinda mixed feelings about this.) Anyhoo, come try this place especially if you love chicken. it is YUMMMMM.
Came here for another friend's birthday. We were in a group of 12 and just like the previous time, we end up being arranged around a pole. The pole essentially divides the table as this awkward divider. The seafood pot pie and truffle mac & cheese are just as good as I remember. mac & cheese has a strong truffle taste, but it doesn't overpower the entire dish. The pot pie is super flaky with plenty of seafood. Food is more expensive than I remember and there is a 20% mandatory gratuity for larger groups.
Fusion works when intertwining varying foods, drink and cultures, but definitely NOT a fusion of cigar smoke and food.  After scouring Yelp and the web for a great place to dine when in SF for a business and pleasure trip I found La Fusion.  All looked awesome and promising for a casual Saturday night dinner.  We were promptly seated at a very small table at the front of the restaurant, only to find an overpowering smell of cigar smoke coming from the cigar store/bar immediately next door.  Asked to be moved to the back of the restaurant away from the frequently opening front door and open windows on the street, but no other tables were available.  We're outa here.  Also very surprised not to find any cerviche on the menu, a showcase on the menu found on their awful website, leaving a gaping hole in what first excited me about La Fusion.This said, credit goes to the lovely hostess who provided a recommendation to a very nice Italian restaurant nearby.
Full chicken - 3.5/5 - so so, i like limon way more because it was more juicy and had a much crispier skinceviche mixto - 3/5 - ok flavors, was quite small for the price, it came with toast bites, wished it were chipsfried empanadas beef - 3.5/5 - crispy, strong flavor, but not as good as the ones in Perutruffle mac & cheese - 4/5 - pretty good, not bad, small portions though, but one of the tastier mac and cheese i hadsweet potato fries - 4/5 - pretty good actually, kept dipping into the orange sauce, nice and crispytres leches - 2.5/5 - was hard, and had a strong banana taste, what gives? odd, didn't taste freshbanana dulce de leche empanadas - 3.5/5 - didn't taste like bananas surprisingly, crispy, a bit too sweet, but not too bad. it does have mushy bananas inside, but bc it's fried, you can't taste itred sangria - 4/5 - on the sweeter side, can't even taste the alcohol, had 2 full bottle because it's quite small for 4 people..service was ok, bathroom was clean (uni sex), small place, walked passed it, not a bad place, but it's more of OK place.
My cousin who moved from NYC to San Fran, raved about how much she loved the Latin Fusion cuisine in La Fusion. She has stated it is difficult to find authentic Latino cuisine that isn't Mexican and misses the flavors that she adored so much in the fusion places NYC has to offer. We were lucky to get a last minute reservation due to a previous cancellation and I must say that I am so thankful for the ability to have been able to try it! We just made it to our reservation after a long ride back to San Francisco from Napa and were delighted to be seated and served immediately. We started off with Sangria because of course more wine after wine is always great:) The sangria was delicious and had hints of citrus fruits and honey which made it feel quite classy:) Definitely one of the best I have tasted!We were so ready to order food, and had been talking about our choices on our ride from Napa. My friend and I ordered and shared the Yucca Fries at $10 a plate, which came with a choice of three sauces but honestly our favorite was the chimmichurri sauce, with chopped cilantro, lime, and garlic who could go wrong! Then we had the arroz con pollo at $16 a plate, which had the most delicious green cilantro sauce in the rice that put the chimichurri sauce to shame... unless it was the same? The chicken had the rotisserie taste I adore and just such a great blend of Latin flavors! We devoured each bite. We also had Mixed Green Salad which included Cucumbers, Onion, Tomato, Choclo with a Champagne Vinaigrette. The choclo are Peruvian corn nuts which taste just like the corn nuts they sell in a bag and were such a wonderful addition to the salad that gave it a unique twist unlike any salad I have ever tasted. My cousin Is OBSESSED with the Fish Ceviche (Ceviche de Pescado) and wanted me to make sure I RAVED about how INCREDIBLE and unlike anything else she has ever tasted it is! She enjoys the Fresh Fish, Corn Nuts, Pickled Red Onions & Aji Amarillo that are detailed with the fish but most of all the lime and garlic that are included in the seasoning. I had a taste and must say that the flavors are indeed phenomenal but I wasn't a fan of the raw chewy fish. Nonetheless, still great!The only thing I would say is a drawback is that there isn't great ventilation so you will leave smelling like the food, however I think this is kind of charming because it makes you feel like you are at somebody's home who is cooking you a personally catered meal. I must add that my favorite part was seeing the owner doing some serving and watching everyone work as a team. At one point two people came to help our server with the plates. I hate that I forgot her name but she was such a sweet girl who was so attentive that she noticed how much we loved the chimichurri sauce and brought us some more! LOVE THIS PLACE. Will try to come back on the next San Fran visit!
I had La Fusion bookmarked for a while and with such amazing ratings its a must try. Came here with a group of girlfriends. It was a group of 7 girls. I felt like the server were impatient with us. Might be that we only had 6 people there and not complete?. But we did order sangria and appetizers to start before the whole party arrived. I didn't think we held up the process for them. I just didn't like the feeling of being rushed but he was trying to be nice not trying to sound pushy. Other than that, services was very good and the hostess was very nice.We started with the Argentinian Style Baked **Empanada (Beef), **sweet potato and **regular fries. The empandaa was very flavorful, pretty tasty to me but the fries was a bit bland. I guess that is why they give you dipping sauces on the side and it was not crispy. We had the large **Sangria as well. Pretty good but I think it was lots sweeter than ones I had before. Don't get me wrong, I love it sweet but some might disgree. Since we are a group of 7, we did order quite a few items.I got the *SEAFOOD POT PIE because it had such good reviews on yelp. Well, that was a disappointment. I was so excited too. The Pastry Puff was not very crispy, shouldn't it be? The taste of the dish was not bad but I just didn't like my dish so much. It's lacking in something, flavors. Maybe it was the chef that night. I had more fish than anything else from the seafood pot pie. I didn't think it was that good. **Truffle Mac and Cheese sides to share. (2 orders) You can smell and taste the truffles. YUM! **WHOLE CHICKEN  $34. I had a piece of that and I really like that. I should have order the Arroz con Pollo instead of my pie. The chicken was cooked perfect. Juicy and tasty. **Pork Chop served with Bacon and that was very tasty. Was not dry at all and lots of flavor. I would recommend that. **Strips of Beef Tenderloin (stir fry) was not really good. The beef was on the dryer side. **Short ribs - My friend said it was just okay. The meat didn't just fall off. Overall experience was not bad but don't think I will come back for anything other than their chicken.
Gosh I can't love this place more! Me and my roommate found this little restaurant by accident, and it became my new favorite since then~ I went there a many times so far and tried different dishes: Rotisserie Chicken is what we will have for sure every time. It never goes wrong! The meat is tender and moistBread salad is to die for!!! I can literally have this one dish for the rest of my life I swear...... Truffle Mac and cheese is awesome as well, super creamy and delicious, totally worth the calories!
I almost died.It's true.I fell 180 ft down the "Snake Dance" route on Half Dome (that's in Yosemite for you cityfolk), thinking I was on the much easier, and much more traveled "Snake Dike" route.Because of the runout nature of this route, I had no gear or bolts for 90 ft and fell down 90ft and then another 90 ft past my belayer.  Scraping against the high-angle granite, trying to keep my feet in front of me, and hoping the rope was going to catch before I smashed into a ledge.And catch it did.  I'll never forget that tug of life.  My climbing partner literally saved my life.

Fusion works when intertwining varying foods, drink and cultures, but definitely NOT a fusion of cigar smoke and food.  After scouring Yelp and the web for a great place to dine when in SF for a business and pleasure trip I found La Fusion.  All looked awesome and promising for a casual Saturday night dinner.  We were promptly seated at a very small table at the front of the restaurant, only to find an overpowering smell of cigar smoke coming from the cigar store/bar immediately next door.  Asked to be moved to the back of the restaurant away from the frequently opening front door and open windows on the street, but no other tables were available.  We're outa here.  Also very surprised not to find any cerviche on the menu, a showcase on the menu found on their awful website, leaving a gaping hole in what first excited me about La Fusion.This said, credit goes to the lovely hostess who provided a recommendation to a very nice Italian restaurant nearby.
Full chicken - 3.5/5 - so so, i like limon way more because it was more juicy and had a much crispier skinceviche mixto - 3/5 - ok flavors, was quite small for the price, it came with toast bites, wished it were chipsfried empanadas beef - 3.5/5 - crispy, strong flavor, but not as good as the ones in Perutruffle mac & cheese - 4/5 - pretty good, not bad, small portions though, but one of the tastier mac and cheese i hadsweet potato fries - 4/5 - pretty good actually, kept dipping into the orange sauce, nice and crispytres leches - 2.5/5 - was hard, and had a strong banana taste, what gives? odd, didn't taste freshbanana dulce de leche empanadas - 3.5/5 - didn't taste like bananas surprisingly, crispy, a bit too sweet, but not too bad. it does have mushy bananas inside, but bc it's fried, you can't taste itred sangria - 4/5 - on the sweeter side, can't even taste the alcohol, had 2 full bottle because it's quite small for 4 people..service was ok, bathroom was clean (uni sex), small place, walked passed it, not a bad place, but it's more of OK place.
My cousin who moved from NYC to San Fran, raved about how much she loved the Latin Fusion cuisine in La Fusion. She has stated it is difficult to find authentic Latino cuisine that isn't Mexican and misses the flavors that she adored so much in the fusion places NYC has to offer. We were lucky to get a last minute reservation due to a previous cancellation and I must say that I am so thankful for the ability to have been able to try it! We just made it to our reservation after a long ride back to San Francisco from Napa and were delighted to be seated and served immediately. We started off with Sangria because of course more wine after wine is always great:) The sangria was delicious and had hints of citrus fruits and honey which made it feel quite classy:) Definitely one of the best I have tasted!We were so ready to order food, and had been talking about our choices on our ride from Napa. My friend and I ordered and shared the Yucca Fries at $10 a plate, which came with a choice of three sauces but honestly our favorite was the chimmichurri sauce, with chopped cilantro, lime, and garlic who could go wrong! Then we had the arroz con pollo at $16 a plate, which had the most delicious green cilantro sauce in the rice that put the chimichurri sauce to shame... unless it was the same? The chicken had the rotisserie taste I adore and just such a great blend of Latin flavors! We devoured each bite. We also had Mixed Green Salad which included Cucumbers, Onion, Tomato, Choclo with a Champagne Vinaigrette. The choclo are Peruvian corn nuts which taste just like the corn nuts they sell in a bag and were such a wonderful addition to the salad that gave it a unique twist unlike any salad I have ever tasted. My cousin Is OBSESSED with the Fish Ceviche (Ceviche de Pescado) and wanted me to make sure I RAVED about how INCREDIBLE and unlike anything else she has ever tasted it is! She enjoys the Fresh Fish, Corn Nuts, Pickled Red Onions & Aji Amarillo that are detailed with the fish but most of all the lime and garlic that are included in the seasoning. I had a taste and must say that the flavors are indeed phenomenal but I wasn't a fan of the raw chewy fish. Nonetheless, still great!The only thing I would say is a drawback is that there isn't great ventilation so you will leave smelling like the food, however I think this is kind of charming because it makes you feel like you are at somebody's home who is cooking you a personally catered meal. I must add that my favorite part was seeing the owner doing some serving and watching everyone work as a team. At one point two people came to help our server with the plates. I hate that I forgot her name but she was such a sweet girl who was so attentive that she noticed how much we loved the chimichurri sauce and brought us some more! LOVE THIS PLACE. Will try to come back on the next San Fran visit!
I had La Fusion bookmarked for a while and with such amazing ratings its a must try. Came here with a group of girlfriends. It was a group of 7 girls. I felt like the server were impatient with us. Might be that we only had 6 people there and not complete?. But we did order sangria and appetizers to start before the whole party arrived. I didn't think we held up the process for them. I just didn't like the feeling of being rushed but he was trying to be nice not trying to sound pushy. Other than that, services was very good and the hostess was very nice.We started with the Argentinian Style Baked **Empanada (Beef), **sweet potato and **regular fries. The empandaa was very flavorful, pretty tasty to me but the fries was a bit bland. I guess that is why they give you dipping sauces on the side and it was not crispy. We had the large **Sangria as well. Pretty good but I think it was lots sweeter than ones I had before. Don't get me wrong, I love it sweet but some might disgree. Since we are a group of 7, we did order quite a few items.I got the *SEAFOOD POT PIE because it had such good reviews on yelp. Well, that was a disappointment. I was so excited too. The Pastry Puff was not very crispy, shouldn't it be? The taste of the dish was not bad but I just didn't like my dish so much. It's lacking in something, flavors. Maybe it was the chef that night. I had more fish than anything else from the seafood pot pie. I didn't think it was that good. **Truffle Mac and Cheese sides to share. (2 orders) You can smell and taste the truffles. YUM! **WHOLE CHICKEN  $34. I had a piece of that and I really like that. I should have order the Arroz con Pollo instead of my pie. The chicken was cooked perfect. Juicy and tasty. **Pork Chop served with Bacon and that was very tasty. Was not dry at all and lots of flavor. I would recommend that. **Strips of Beef Tenderloin (stir fry) was not really good. The beef was on the dryer side. **Short ribs - My friend said it was just okay. The meat didn't just fall off. Overall experience was not bad but don't think I will come back for anything other than their chicken.
Gosh I can't love this place more! Me and my roommate found this little restaurant by accident, and it became my new favorite since then~ I went there a many times so far and tried different dishes: Rotisserie Chicken is what we will have for sure every time. It never goes wrong! The meat is tender and moistBread salad is to die for!!! I can literally have this one dish for the rest of my life I swear...... Truffle Mac and cheese is awesome as well, super creamy and delicious, totally worth the calories!
I almost died.It's true.I fell 180 ft down the "Snake Dance" route on Half Dome (that's in Yosemite for you cityfolk), thinking I was on the much easier, and much more traveled "Snake Dike" route.Because of the runout nature of this route, I had no gear or bolts for 90 ft and fell down 90ft and then another 90 ft past my belayer.  Scraping against the high-angle granite, trying to keep my feet in front of me, and hoping the rope was going to catch before I smashed into a ledge.And catch it did.  I'll never forget that tug of life.  My climbing partner literally saved my life. (her hands were pretty badly mangled from absorbing all that energy during the fall :( )This happened two days before my birthday.Two days later I was in San Francisco for job training.My climbing partner and I went here, on my birthday, after we almost died.I guess what I'm saying is: my review is probably a little biased.I was very impressed with the ambiance.  I love the classy, laid-back little hole-in-the-walls that are so common in San Francisco, and so rare almost everywhere else.The staff was great, the hardest part was choosing what to order.I ended up going with lamb.  I never had lamb growing up,and now I can't get enough of it!  It was incredible.Great service, great ambiance, great food, and reasonable prices...I love big cities.I'll never forget this place.
My friends and I came here to celebrate the end of the semester in December and it was so good!!! One of the people in our group came here before and suggested coming here again. We didn't make reservation, and upon arriving, they told us it would be a 45min-1hour wait for a group of 5. I put down my name, and we decided to wander around and see if there were any other restaurants we would want to eat at instead. There's an alleyway around the corner with plenty of restaurants, but none of them seemed to beat La Fusion. We decided to stick to La Fusion and the wait turned out to only be a little less than an hour. We ordered the truffle mac & cheese, empanadas, championeses envueltos, ceviche mixto, and lomo saltado. I'm not a big fan of mac & cheese, but I saw that it was one of their most popular dishes, so I decided to give it a try. I am SO SO SO happy I ordered it! The truffle flavor blended very nicely with the sharpness of the cheese. I'm usually not a fan of mac & cheese because of how heavy it is, but this one was on the lighter side and wasn't overwhelming. The empanadas were also really good and were very crispy. My favorite was the championese envueltos, which is a mushroom strudel that also came with mashed potatoes. My two greatest loves are mushrooms and potatoes, so this was my favorite dish. The sauce inside the strudel was like gravy, and complemented the natural flavors of the mushrooms really well. The mashed potatoes was heavenly...It was so creamy and buttery and fluffy. I felt like I was in a mashed potato cloud as I engulfed a bite. I'm a big lomo saltado fan, and I was very pleased with theirs. The meat was done extremely well; not too rare and not too well done. It was probably the most tender lomo saltado I've ever had. We were still a big hungry, but wasn't sure if we wanted to order another entree, so our server suggested us to try a ceviche. I was skeptical at first because I wasn't sure how fresh their raw seafood was, but I'm glad we went with it! We got the ceviche mixto, which had salsa, shrimp, fish, onions, oyster, garlic, and others. The seafood was really fresh and it came with bread crisps. The food was beyond amazing, and the service was great! 10/10 would recommend coming here if you're in the area! But I would suggest making a reservation.
The short: delicious (and tiny)empanadas I was intimidated by some of the diners who were wearing some suits, but they still take plebeians like me ;) The place is long, extending towards the back, though I'm not sure about the exact size and the capacity because we chose a table at the window next to the entrance.My friend and I decided on the fried empanadas. They are tiny, delicious things and alone are not good for a full meal. My friend wanted something to drink, so the waiter suggested the purple corn drink. I had a taste of it, and despite its strange name, it tastes wonderful! Since the main empanadas were not enough, we shared a dessert banana empanada, which also tasted wonderful.We liked our server, who was very nice. Haha! He was very flirty and my friend and I were giggling the entire time. That purple corn drink my friend ordered? On the house! Thanks good sir!I'm not used to paying so much for such small portions. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind coming back if somebody else was paying or I was earning more heheh.
Chicken with rice, arugula salad and truffle mac and cheese. I didn't love any of the dishes. The chicken was done nicely.Candied walnuts were delicious combined with the dressing in the salad. If you don't mind bitterness from the arugula (it was only remedied by looking for bits of candied walnuts to combine it with) it's a safe bet.I thought the beets could have been flavored in a way that was more complimentary to the salad, they seemed out of place, kind of bland. The truffle oil or overall flavor of the mac and cheese reminded me of when you boil hot dogs - what that hot-dog boiling water would taste like. Guess it wasn't for me. The rice served with the chicken wasn't my thing, there was a weird flavor that wasn't quite tangy.. but was in that realm of flavor. I don't like cilantro, so it makes sense that I wouldn't like the rice, though. My dining partner sometimes doesn't either, but I think my she didn't hate it, as she ate about 1/3 of it. We both enjoyed the chicken, which was flavorful and done nicely.It wasn't horrible, also not a place I'd pick again. I'd go if someone else really wanted to.
Food:Ceviche Mixto...$16....Yummy!!! And a good size portion for an appetizerLa Fusion Seafood Pot Pie...$24....AMAZING!!!! A must try.  Sauce is so good and can also be a dipping sauce for the rotisserie chicken.Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas....$8....Good!!Service:Arrived at the right time, 11:40a.m-ish, right before the lunch time rush.  The server was very attentive, helpful and suggested some favorites.  Overall Experience:Definitely a good one. I'll be back to try other ceviches and other apps IF i'm not going there mainly for the pot pie.
Food is amazing!! Had the half pound chicken with salad and their infamous Mac n Cheese (it's to die for!) and everything tasted amazing! Only downside is no beer on draft and the space is extremely small and it's hard to find! Ended up walking around it twice (full blocks) bc it's so hard to find. Definitely worth coming to for the food though!
Simple decor & lovely food.Would be back soon
I came here with my best friends for a quick snack before we headed to the bars. We had their Empanadas (corn & fish), Yucca Fries, and Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas. I loved the sauces that came with the empanadas, it compliment together very well, my fave sauce was the piquillo pepper aioli. The Banana and Dulce de Leche Empanadas is a MUST TRY, our waiter recommended it to us and it was delicious!  What can go wrong with bananas and ice cream?I definitely want to come here again and try their truffle mac and cheese and chicken!
This place is like a large hallway plus a kitchen. I sat at the bar and had the lomo saltado and half carate of sangria. They use Panzu sauce for the steak which tasted like a thick soy sauce. It was good, but there was way too much. It overpowered everything else on the plate and the steak alone didn't have much flavor. I've had better lomo saltados before (for example: Fresca). The sangria was good, but for a half pitcher I wasn't even tipsy. The staff here is very friendly though. They make sure to greet everyone upon entrance and they constantly checked in on me and asked how my food was.
