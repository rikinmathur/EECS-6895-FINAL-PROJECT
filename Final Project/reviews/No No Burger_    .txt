BURGER!!!!This is the best vegan burger ever I've tried so far.I had the classic with cheese, which tasted like an In-N-Out burger (!!!)The patty is definitely tastes like meat, the thousand island tastes like thousand island, and the cheese definitely melts and tastes like cheese. Everything is fresh. You can trust this review because I used to love and eat (inhale) beef burgers. No No Burger has translated some of the best features of hamburgers over to the vegan side.I need to try all the other types and toppings.Delicious!
I blame my mother for my hesitation at eating mushrooms, but I thank places like No No Burger for showing me the light. Mushrooms cooked the wrong way are terrible, but mushroom cooked the right away are incredible! And that's what No No Burger's Melted Mushroom burger taught me! You'll get a house-made patty, lettuce, pickles, grilled and raw onions, No No sauce, sautéed mushrooms & melted cheddar for the reasonable price of $11. Expect your tastebuds to be blown away and your burger standard to be raised ten fold. Why go to a burger restaurant when the real deal can be purchased straight from a truck?! Thanks No No for showing me the light!
Okay seriously? What have we done to deserve such good vegan food?! This place is literally the most amazing place in SF. I always leave completely satisfied and totally  stuffed.I take EVERYONE here, even my non Vegan friends, the staff is friendly, the food impeccable and it's walking distance from my house. I highly recommend the volcano....
What makes a great vegetarian or vegan burger?I get the meat sweats so I'm no vegetarian or vegan (much respect for those who are) but a solid vegetarian or vegan burger should make you NOT miss beef, yah?  Source knew this as they made THE best beet burger ever! RIP, you're truly missed. The No No Burger @SoMa StrEat Food Park was poor quality, poorly executed, and expensive. My friend and I shared the Classic No No Burger w/ avocado, "bacon" & crinkle cut fries for $17: bit.ly/1UHg1Yq. Seeing that I can get a burger and fries at Spruce, Nopa, and just about any upscale New American Restaurant in SF for around the same price, I expected something better than Foods Co-ish ingredients thrown together. Looks-wise, the burger looked like a cafeteria burger but what's important is the taste. It was mushy and wet in the center - really unappetizing. While waiting for our order, I saw one of the workers use his fingers (with gloves) to scoop out the avocado and smear it onto the burger. Not a big deal since he was wearing gloves but for such a pricey vegan burger, sliced avocados would be nice. What little avocado we received for $2 was brown and grey. The addition of the $2 faux bacon was missing but I didn't want to stand in line again and wait another 15 minutes so that's on me. Crinkle cut fries were crunchy but that's hard to mess up. With all the stellar reviews, I was hoping to fool my carniwhore friend like I did with Source's burger:Friend *takes first bite*: "Ummm, why does it taste like that?"Me: "It's a vegan burger."Friend: "WTF, I ain't giving up anything for lent so you trying to imply something...like I need to diet?"Me: "In-N-Out later?"Friend: "Now, that's WHY we're friends!"P.S. - The lady cashier was really upbeat and friendly!
I do appreciate a good vegetarian burger, especially a creative one.There are quite a few options in life.So, I came to No No Burger in search of an actual burger. It wasn't until after I ordered the Ring of Fire (with ghost pepper sauce on the side) that I realized that the burger may not be made of beef, whoops! Honestly, it's not my jam. The burger patty itself lacked flavor, texture, and was super thin. I've had many vegetarian burgers in my day (even made them myself) and it just was aiight, quite monotone. I would expect more from a housemade patty. The amount of No No sauce that's smeared all over is overwhelming and a turn off. The ratio of burger, to condiments, to fried onions, to chilis, to sauce is way off and unbalanced. Just. Too. Much. (especially not being a huge fan of mayo). I did know what I was ordering, just thought it would be a better ratio.I did appreciate that when I asked for no bun, they wrapped it in lettuce.
After several months of being on hiatus, No No Burger is back!  They have their trailer set up permanently at SOMA StrEAT Food Park in SF and are open every day except Monday, I believe.  I'm a bit sad that they are no longer popping up in my neighborhood in the far East Bay (Concord) but on the other hand, I'm happy and glad that they are back in business!  I missed them and craved their burgers so much while they were away.It's pretty cool to see that they've expanded their menu and now offer waffle fries with sriracha and mayo and more add on's for the burger like vegan bacon and avocado.  They even offer a vegan version of "animal style" fries.  One thing I noticed is that the bun has changed.  I really miss the previous fresh baked bun and hope they bring it back.  Congrats to No No Burger for being back in business and that they are off to a successful start!  I was there last Sunday for the monthly Very Vegan Sunday's at SOMA StEAT Food Park and they were the most popular truck in the park.
A no frills vegan burger food truck that WOWS you from first bite to end.I had my first No No at the Eat Real Festival in 2014 in Oakland. I did not even realize it was a vegan stand until it was pointed out to me by a friend. I'm so glad he did, because when I bit into it, my entire understanding of vegan burger changed.Veggie burgers are one of those "standards" when it comes to being a vegetarian or vegan. We've all eaten way too many of them in our lives, willingly or not, and there are simply so many. And they range from amazing to downright disgusting. I stopped eating veggie burgers because there is simply more vegan food to be had in this world.That being said, after I ate No No, I knew that this is the only Veggie Burger that I would WANT to come back and eat more again and again.After over a 1 year No No Dry Spell, I received Christmas early this year, No No burger was going to be part of the rotating selection of food trucks at Soma Streat Park!!I got my butt over there on Thursday, said hi to Brandi W. (Hi Brandi!), and ordered myself a No No with Sauteed Mushrooms & Cheese.When I bit into it, it was like No No at first sight all over again. The tasty patty, full of flavor, soft, and comforting, mixed with the oozing 'cheese' just made my taste buds do a happy dance. Every now and then, I got a huge bite of mushroom which was exciting. The only thing that would make this better is probably some fresh California avocados or guacamole. Can we make that happen?I even had my omnivore friend order one and was happily surprised at the quality and taste of the burger. I'm already thinking about my next No No Burger, and I'm happy it will be sometime sooner than later!
I'll be honest- even when I ate meat I didn't really care that much about burgers unless it was on the way home at 3AM, but I'd heard enough emphatic recommendations of No No Burger to give it a go. And yeah, okay, I get it. I was on the move so I got a Ring of Fire and fries to go. The burger was served up quickly by very friendly staff. Once I finally got around to eating it was delighted to find the slightly chewy, moist texture of the patty, the creamy spiciness of the sauce and the soft bun. The small fries was anything but. I'll confess that I checked whether they were open for dinner once I finished.
Addicted to the Ring of Fire burger but can't go wrong with any of the burgers listed on the menu. I've tried a lot of veggie burgers and this one hands down is my favorite. Ghost sauce on the side for a nice kick. Plus the waffle fries drenched in crema and sirarcha are a fatty bonus. The regular fries are blah but everything else so good. Don't mistake this for healthy eating. It's a nice indulgence and you won't miss animal meat. Trust.Location is at the Soma Street Food park by the SF Costco.
Good but for $9 I was hoping for better since I saw such good reviews....Honestly, it just tasted like a more premium McDonald's burger. The bun was average and tasted like you could buy it from a normal grocery store. I wish it was at least toasted. The lettuce was also your typical lettuce from Subway. I was decently full afterwards but it wasn't a huge burger.Pretty disappointing. That said, the workers here are super friendly.
I love their burgers! I don't know why someone would say their burgers are small... I completely disagree! Burgers are filling and full of flavor! I can always count on Nono burgers for a nice filling vegan meal!My husband loves it, my mother in law (non vegan) loves it as well.
For a veggie burger it's pretty good BUT starting at $9 for the basic burger and maxing out at a whopping $12 for the Ring of Fire it damn well better be! Add some fries for $3, $5 or with some Sriracha and mayo $7!! Thats right, $2 for a squirt of Sriracha and mayo which is usually free at almost every single place on Earth. I went there the other day not thinking and just ordered without looking at the menu, I ended up dropping $21.00 for a Ring of Fire burger and Sriracha fries! No drink! Did I mention Ring of Fire? A drink would have put me at $25 so I suffered through the burn.. I mean come on No No, you're a friggin food truck, you're suppose to be cheap! As good as the burger is it's not worth the money. Sorry No No, you just lost a loyal customer, I'll go back to $2 veggie tacos and save the $25 for a good bottle of wine, or and entree at Range.
So thrilled to know that this truck will be at the StrEat Park. The Ring of Fire burger is incredible.  If you're wondering if you should eat at No No, i'll keep the answer simple for you: YES YES!!!!
Awesome! I'm not much of one for vegan burgers, but these were delicious! And the fries are amazing too - I wouldn't have thought to put Sriracha and vegan mayo together, but these guys really know what they're doing. The people who work here and friendly and very willing to give suggestions, as well. I really enjoyed this lunch! Was surprisingly filling, too!
Do you want to try the best burger of your life? Then go track down No No Burger and have a taste. I can't believe these burgers are vegan. I have no fucking clue how they make them but they are perfect, with the tastiest bacon (unfathomably delicious) and buns toasted to perfection. Get bacon and avocado, you won't regret it. The Ring of Fire is fantastic. Skip the fries, they're not worth the extra few bucks.
The melted mushroom burger is my favorite vegan burger so far! It's absolutely delicious and contains no nuts! I could come here every day and eat this burger with the waffle fries! Love love love this! A new fave!
Glad I finally tried this place out.  I love the name I keep visualizing a teacher in a classroom shaking her fingers saying "NO NO" to the student eating a real meat burger.  I guess I have a little strange sense of humor but that's a whole another story. Getting back to NO NO, this is in a park of food trucks where you have a choice of burgers from classic to Chile Cheese, mushroom, and BBQ.  Some have fried Jalapenos as in the volcano or ring of fire.   It's pretty straight forward menu or burgers and fries with a couple add-ons if you prefer.  The standard burger is around $11-12 bucks and that only gets you a side of potato chips.  Add fries, bacon, or avo and it ads another $2 for each. Spending close to $15 for a veggie burger was a little hard to swallow but hey I guess this is San Francisco.  They all come with NO NO sauce which mimics the secret sauce  from MD but a vegan version and with Chipoltle.  Because I never have been a fan of mayonnaise  I got mine with the sauce on the side.  First bite in I thought this is so close to an in and out burger, especially the texture of the bun.  It's messy and things move around when attempting to eat so be prepared.  I had the Chile one and it was very good.  I put on a tiny amount of the secret sauce and it was ok but glad I had that on the side.  I also didn't realize that you can ask for ghost sauce for free.  Wish I knew that because I would have thrown some of that as well.  Overall it was a good place to try and I only came down a star because of price.  The service also is a little dry but then that's kind of SF so I guess not atypical.
This is without question the best fucking burger I have ever had. I now crave the "ring of fire" burger with added avocado (or course) and a side of hot crispy fries and a pickle. Perfection.
Finally! So delicious... so easy to be vegan :)
Not your typical veggie burger. In my 25+ years of being a vegetarian I have eaten hundreds of veggie burgers and I can say that this is, by far, the best I have ever had. And it is so nice to know your burger isn't getting contaminated by gross meat juice!Today I had the Hawaiian Burger on special and it was delish. I cannot wait to try them all.

And yeah, okay, I get it. I was on the move so I got a Ring of Fire and fries to go. The burger was served up quickly by very friendly staff. Once I finally got around to eating it was delighted to find the slightly chewy, moist texture of the patty, the creamy spiciness of the sauce and the soft bun. The small fries was anything but. I'll confess that I checked whether they were open for dinner once I finished.
Addicted to the Ring of Fire burger but can't go wrong with any of the burgers listed on the menu. I've tried a lot of veggie burgers and this one hands down is my favorite. Ghost sauce on the side for a nice kick. Plus the waffle fries drenched in crema and sirarcha are a fatty bonus. The regular fries are blah but everything else so good. Don't mistake this for healthy eating. It's a nice indulgence and you won't miss animal meat. Trust.Location is at the Soma Street Food park by the SF Costco.
Good but for $9 I was hoping for better since I saw such good reviews....Honestly, it just tasted like a more premium McDonald's burger. The bun was average and tasted like you could buy it from a normal grocery store. I wish it was at least toasted. The lettuce was also your typical lettuce from Subway. I was decently full afterwards but it wasn't a huge burger.Pretty disappointing. That said, the workers here are super friendly.
I love their burgers! I don't know why someone would say their burgers are small... I completely disagree! Burgers are filling and full of flavor! I can always count on Nono burgers for a nice filling vegan meal!My husband loves it, my mother in law (non vegan) loves it as well.
For a veggie burger it's pretty good BUT starting at $9 for the basic burger and maxing out at a whopping $12 for the Ring of Fire it damn well better be! Add some fries for $3, $5 or with some Sriracha and mayo $7!! Thats right, $2 for a squirt of Sriracha and mayo which is usually free at almost every single place on Earth. I went there the other day not thinking and just ordered without looking at the menu, I ended up dropping $21.00 for a Ring of Fire burger and Sriracha fries! No drink! Did I mention Ring of Fire? A drink would have put me at $25 so I suffered through the burn.. I mean come on No No, you're a friggin food truck, you're suppose to be cheap! As good as the burger is it's not worth the money. Sorry No No, you just lost a loyal customer, I'll go back to $2 veggie tacos and save the $25 for a good bottle of wine, or and entree at Range.
So thrilled to know that this truck will be at the StrEat Park. The Ring of Fire burger is incredible.  If you're wondering if you should eat at No No, i'll keep the answer simple for you: YES YES!!!!
Awesome! I'm not much of one for vegan burgers, but these were delicious! And the fries are amazing too - I wouldn't have thought to put Sriracha and vegan mayo together, but these guys really know what they're doing. The people who work here and friendly and very willing to give suggestions, as well. I really enjoyed this lunch! Was surprisingly filling, too!
Do you want to try the best burger of your life? Then go track down No No Burger and have a taste. I can't believe these burgers are vegan. I have no fucking clue how they make them but they are perfect, with the tastiest bacon (unfathomably delicious) and buns toasted to perfection. Get bacon and avocado, you won't regret it. The Ring of Fire is fantastic. Skip the fries, they're not worth the extra few bucks.
The melted mushroom burger is my favorite vegan burger so far! It's absolutely delicious and contains no nuts! I could come here every day and eat this burger with the waffle fries! Love love love this! A new fave!
Glad I finally tried this place out.  I love the name I keep visualizing a teacher in a classroom shaking her fingers saying "NO NO" to the student eating a real meat burger.  I guess I have a little strange sense of humor but that's a whole another story. Getting back to NO NO, this is in a park of food trucks where you have a choice of burgers from classic to Chile Cheese, mushroom, and BBQ.  Some have fried Jalapenos as in the volcano or ring of fire.   It's pretty straight forward menu or burgers and fries with a couple add-ons if you prefer.  The standard burger is around $11-12 bucks and that only gets you a side of potato chips.  Add fries, bacon, or avo and it ads another $2 for each. Spending close to $15 for a veggie burger was a little hard to swallow but hey I guess this is San Francisco.  They all come with NO NO sauce which mimics the secret sauce  from MD but a vegan version and with Chipoltle.  Because I never have been a fan of mayonnaise  I got mine with the sauce on the side.  First bite in I thought this is so close to an in and out burger, especially the texture of the bun.  It's messy and things move around when attempting to eat so be prepared.  I had the Chile one and it was very good.  I put on a tiny amount of the secret sauce and it was ok but glad I had that on the side.  I also didn't realize that you can ask for ghost sauce for free.  Wish I knew that because I would have thrown some of that as well.  Overall it was a good place to try and I only came down a star because of price.  The service also is a little dry but then that's kind of SF so I guess not atypical.
This is without question the best fucking burger I have ever had. I now crave the "ring of fire" burger with added avocado (or course) and a side of hot crispy fries and a pickle. Perfection.
Finally! So delicious... so easy to be vegan :)
Not your typical veggie burger. In my 25+ years of being a vegetarian I have eaten hundreds of veggie burgers and I can say that this is, by far, the best I have ever had. And it is so nice to know your burger isn't getting contaminated by gross meat juice!Today I had the Hawaiian Burger on special and it was delish. I cannot wait to try them all.
BURGER!!!!This is the best vegan burger ever I've tried so far.I had the classic with cheese, which tasted like an In-N-Out burger (!!!)The patty is definitely tastes like meat, the thousand island tastes like thousand island, and the cheese definitely melts and tastes like cheese. Everything is fresh. You can trust this review because I used to love and eat (inhale) beef burgers. No No Burger has translated some of the best features of hamburgers over to the vegan side.I need to try all the other types and toppings.Delicious!
I blame my mother for my hesitation at eating mushrooms, but I thank places like No No Burger for showing me the light. Mushrooms cooked the wrong way are terrible, but mushroom cooked the right away are incredible! And that's what No No Burger's Melted Mushroom burger taught me! You'll get a house-made patty, lettuce, pickles, grilled and raw onions, No No sauce, sautéed mushrooms & melted cheddar for the reasonable price of $11. Expect your tastebuds to be blown away and your burger standard to be raised ten fold. Why go to a burger restaurant when the real deal can be purchased straight from a truck?! Thanks No No for showing me the light!
Okay seriously? What have we done to deserve such good vegan food?! This place is literally the most amazing place in SF. I always leave completely satisfied and totally  stuffed.I take EVERYONE here, even my non Vegan friends, the staff is friendly, the food impeccable and it's walking distance from my house. I highly recommend the volcano....
What makes a great vegetarian or vegan burger?I get the meat sweats so I'm no vegetarian or vegan (much respect for those who are) but a solid vegetarian or vegan burger should make you NOT miss beef, yah?  Source knew this as they made THE best beet burger ever! RIP, you're truly missed. The No No Burger @SoMa StrEat Food Park was poor quality, poorly executed, and expensive. My friend and I shared the Classic No No Burger w/ avocado, "bacon" & crinkle cut fries for $17: bit.ly/1UHg1Yq. Seeing that I can get a burger and fries at Spruce, Nopa, and just about any upscale New American Restaurant in SF for around the same price, I expected something better than Foods Co-ish ingredients thrown together. Looks-wise, the burger looked like a cafeteria burger but what's important is the taste. It was mushy and wet in the center - really unappetizing. While waiting for our order, I saw one of the workers use his fingers (with gloves) to scoop out the avocado and smear it onto the burger. Not a big deal since he was wearing gloves but for such a pricey vegan burger, sliced avocados would be nice. What little avocado we received for $2 was brown and grey. The addition of the $2 faux bacon was missing but I didn't want to stand in line again and wait another 15 minutes so that's on me. Crinkle cut fries were crunchy but that's hard to mess up. With all the stellar reviews, I was hoping to fool my carniwhore friend like I did with Source's burger:Friend *takes first bite*: "Ummm, why does it taste like that?"Me: "It's a vegan burger."Friend: "WTF, I ain't giving up anything for lent so you trying to imply something...like I need to diet?"Me: "In-N-Out later?"Friend: "Now, that's WHY we're friends!"P.S. - The lady cashier was really upbeat and friendly!
I do appreciate a good vegetarian burger, especially a creative one.There are quite a few options in life.So, I came to No No Burger in search of an actual burger. It wasn't until after I ordered the Ring of Fire (with ghost pepper sauce on the side) that I realized that the burger may not be made of beef, whoops! Honestly, it's not my jam. The burger patty itself lacked flavor, texture, and was super thin. I've had many vegetarian burgers in my day (even made them myself) and it just was aiight, quite monotone. I would expect more from a housemade patty. The amount of No No sauce that's smeared all over is overwhelming and a turn off. The ratio of burger, to condiments, to fried onions, to chilis, to sauce is way off and unbalanced. Just. Too. Much. (especially not being a huge fan of mayo). I did know what I was ordering, just thought it would be a better ratio.I did appreciate that when I asked for no bun, they wrapped it in lettuce.
After several months of being on hiatus, No No Burger is back!  They have their trailer set up permanently at SOMA StrEAT Food Park in SF and are open every day except Monday, I believe.  I'm a bit sad that they are no longer popping up in my neighborhood in the far East Bay (Concord) but on the other hand, I'm happy and glad that they are back in business!  I missed them and craved their burgers so much while they were away.It's pretty cool to see that they've expanded their menu and now offer waffle fries with sriracha and mayo and more add on's for the burger like vegan bacon and avocado.  They even offer a vegan version of "animal style" fries.  One thing I noticed is that the bun has changed.  I really miss the previous fresh baked bun and hope they bring it back.  Congrats to No No Burger for being back in business and that they are off to a successful start!  I was there last Sunday for the monthly Very Vegan Sunday's at SOMA StEAT Food Park and they were the most popular truck in the park.
A no frills vegan burger food truck that WOWS you from first bite to end.I had my first No No at the Eat Real Festival in 2014 in Oakland. I did not even realize it was a vegan stand until it was pointed out to me by a friend. I'm so glad he did, because when I bit into it, my entire understanding of vegan burger changed.Veggie burgers are one of those "standards" when it comes to being a vegetarian or vegan. We've all eaten way too many of them in our lives, willingly or not, and there are simply so many. And they range from amazing to downright disgusting. I stopped eating veggie burgers because there is simply more vegan food to be had in this world.That being said, after I ate No No, I knew that this is the only Veggie Burger that I would WANT to come back and eat more again and again.After over a 1 year No No Dry Spell, I received Christmas early this year, No No burger was going to be part of the rotating selection of food trucks at Soma Streat Park!!I got my butt over there on Thursday, said hi to Brandi W. (Hi Brandi!), and ordered myself a No No with Sauteed Mushrooms & Cheese.When I bit into it, it was like No No at first sight all over again. The tasty patty, full of flavor, soft, and comforting, mixed with the oozing 'cheese' just made my taste buds do a happy dance. Every now and then, I got a huge bite of mushroom which was exciting. The only thing that would make this better is probably some fresh California avocados or guacamole. Can we make that happen?I even had my omnivore friend order one and was happily surprised at the quality and taste of the burger. I'm already thinking about my next No No Burger, and I'm happy it will be sometime sooner than later!
