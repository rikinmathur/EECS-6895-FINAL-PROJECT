Best sandwiches in the area for sure!The bread is fresh, the meat (I love the chicken but the pork is great too) is amazing, and the people are friendly even though they don't understand English very well. That's kind of an understatement, you often need to repeat your order even if it is just one simple sandwich. For only $3.75 though, it's totally amazing.Most of the time you have to wait in line, but they work really fast so you rarely need to wait more than five minutes. Which is totally worth it!Oh, and the area is kinda sketchy but that's not this place's fault.
Many years ago, I visited San Francisco and ate the most delicious banh mi of my life. For a city choke full of amazing food, I could only remember this buttery morsel of deliciousness. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, or perhaps I have just dined at too many fine establishments and raised my standards too high since then. Either way, the combination sandwich this time was short of spectacular. The meat fillings, definitely the pate, were delicious, but the bread could use some work. The bread was borderline tough/stale, leaving much room to desire some flakey crisp bread during each bite.
Perfect banh mi for a perfect price! Just... Be careful. Area can be tricky!I go here for lunches. The roasted pork banh mi is an incredible steal at under $5. The service is quick, but this is basically a grab-and-go shop. Little to no seating, and you have to be careful, given the homeless population around the Tenderloin (oftentimes, they can be aggressive... It's sad, but just be careful and vigilant about your belongings, and find a nice charity to give to.)The food, though, is excellent. They also have a small range of Asian pastries and snacks. Highly, highly recommended*!*With the above caveats...
We all know that a place with this many reviews and this many stars might be worth trying out.  It's the coveted banh mi after all.  For less than $5, you can get one that will cool down your banh mi blood cells.To avoid the lunchtime line, I stopped by around 7:30am and was a solo customer.  Will it still be good by 12pm though?  I'm sure my combo banh mi tasted even better while at its freshest, but I cannot deny the cheerful forest animals that pranced around me while I took each bite.Once unwrapped, my sandwich was bursting with filling, a nimiety of bright green and orange.  A very happy banh mi I'd say.A happy banh mi with patê so rich, meat so soft and bits of fat that were hardly the chewy type I loathe.  The sliced peppers stung my lips, yet the pain urged me to take another bite of pickled flavors and the myriad of prepared pork.  They each tasted unique, but together, they were a group hug from longtime friends that were just meant for each other.  Even the bear of a bread appeared tough on the browned exterior.  Through the crispy shell there is an inviting bed of dough, a perfect resting place for the other pieces that make this banh mi dac biet one of the best I have ever experienced.Maybe I'm just deprived of good banh mi in Dallas.  Even so, I have this memory to fall back on whenever I try to enjoy one back home.
Came here yesterday to get a banh mi after visiting the Asian Art Museum. It was raining cats and dogs, so thankfully there wasn't a long wait at all. The banh mi are mostly $3.75 each, although there are a few other banh mi that are a bit more. Cash only, and tax is included in the price of the sandwich. It's a bit pricier than what I am used to paying for a banh mi (usually I pay around 2.50-3$), but the banh mi here are pretty gosh darn good. I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (also known as a bánh mì thi.t nu*ó*ng), which was loaded with meat and pickled veggies, and laden with a rich, thick meaty 'dark sauce'. Usually banh mi is accompanied with Maggi sauce, but their 'dark sauce' was definitely something... something out of this world! The flavor, quality and dense packed nature of the banh mi is definitely worth the $3.75.  As described by previous reviewers, Saigon Sandwich is a take-out kind of place.  First of all, you're likely going to not be able to sit down and eat as there is limited seating (two seats only!) and table space. There are also no bathrooms either.  Secondly, homeless tend to stand outside of Saigon's doorway.  They don't bother me, but it was a little sad/uncomfortable eating my sandwich inside Saigon Sandwich knowing they were probably hungry as they saw me and others eating away.Lastly, there happened to be a few sparrows that were seeking refuge inside Saigon, probably to keep dry from the pouring rain and to try to find some food scraps to eat. These sparrows were definitely NOT shy -- one of the sparrows actually crawled and flew on my hair and then later climbed and crawled onto my leg. I always thought sparrows looked cute, but this one was pretty bold. It was definitely SPARROW VS. MAN.  Who would be able to win for the last bite of banh mi...sparrow or man?  While I do love mother nature and the great outdoors, it was kind of annoying having to guard/shield my food so it wouldn't be eaten by the sparrow.Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.  If you don't want your food to be eaten up my bold and daring sparrows, I recommend you to take your sandwich to go!
Delicious banh mi, without the frills.I came here, not terribly hungry, having eaten at Brenda's nearby not more than a few hours before. Nonetheless, I had been meaning to try Saigon Sandwich for a while now, and being so close to where I was staying, I felt I had to pay a visit.The special combination (roast pork, pork loaf, and pate) banh mi is absolutely delicious. A freshly toasted baguette, stuffed with tender roast pork, with a generous spread of pate, and finally stuffed with thinly-sliced carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro. The crustiness of the baguette, the softness and chewiness of the meat, and the crunch of the vegetables all come together for a great and filling meal. You know it's good when the juices are running down your arm and you just don't care. You have to think about how quality the ingredients might be, but since the sandwiches are so tasty, it's easy to forget that you might not be getting the absolute best pork/bread/vegetables available in SF.Vegetarians can also come for the tofu banh mi, which I was told was delicious as well. The couple ahead of me told me that they swore by the tofu banh mi for years, so that's gotta stand for something.As for service, the ladies behind the counter aren't the friendliest in the world, but they do work incredibly efficiently, churn out sandwiches like clockwork, and are surprisingly patient with special requests, so that's really all you can hope for. Also, there is no questioning that the value is outstanding. For a fully loaded banh mi, I'd expect to pay about $6-8, but almost all banh mis are about $4, which is absolutely unheard of in this day and age. I'm not complaining at all, but it's crazy! I have a hard time finding no-frills banh mi in New York, and even the less expensive places are at least $8-10 for a sandwich. Note that it is cash only. A must-visit for both banh mi aficionados and value hounds alike. Given that I typically stay around Hayes Valley/Van Ness, I'll definitely be back if I want a great cheap meal.
Wow!! Talk about the perfect home-comfort hearty delicious sandwich. Much respect and love to the Vietnamese and French fusion that brought about the Banh Mi. Everything is delicious here -- as in all 4 menu items. I definitely recommend the Combo Banh Mi that has chicken, pork, and pate. Or just the Chicken Banh Mi. Or both! For $4.75/ sandwich -- you should just get two or three or more! Chicken is sweet and juicy, almost like teriyaki. Baguettes are toasted beautifully. Pickled carrots and garnished are refreshing, sweet, and tangy. The ladies here definitely mastered their Banh Mi craft!! It's amazing!
This place is good for quick Vietnamese sandwiches.  Saigon style authentic  sandwiches.  All $3.75.  Don't try the tofu if your  vegetarian. It's delicious but it's basted in meat sauce.   Always a long line for lunch but it moves quickly.
OMG best bahn mi ever. $3.75. It was Sunday and there was a short line out the door but it went fast. There were some other first-timers there too. A regular said roast pork and chicken were best. The french roll at been toasted to crunchy goodness and was super tasty. I got the roast pork which was very thinly sliced and yummy. Very nice sauce, lots of veggies and cilantro. I could have used extra jalepenos but I didn't think this wasy not the place for custom orders. That said, I heard someone order tofu, which wasn't on the menu, so I'm going to try that next time.I also got the goo in the cup (purple) and some sliced coconut goo as well. It was super fresh and was sitting on the counter, not refrigerated, so it was especially yummy.
Finallllllly got here in time to try the banh mi spot that everyone and their mama swears by. Verdict? MMMMMM!The combination special includes a generous portion of chicken, pork loaf, pate, and the usual pickled veggie culprits. Proteins were spot on... juicy, flavorful, and overall good eats. But beyond that, a few other things stood out as well. I liked that it wasn't too bready. Whereas some banh mi joints tend to leave a lot of the bread crumb intact, Saigon Sandwich does right by the customer in taking it out. Also, the picked veggies are julienned much thinner than your standard banh mi joint. It was a welcomed change in texture providing just enough fresh crunch, but not too much. For four bucks and some change? I'll take three more sandwiches to go, please *clap emoji.*
So good, no line at 11:30 am, no need for details, even the bread was hot!Fast and friendly service.I can't wait to go again. I'm stuffed for $4.25
How can sandwiches get better than this? As everyone can see - $3.75. Made in literal seconds. The ladies ask you if you want pate or not and then a perfectly wrapped, beautifully seasoned banh mi is handed to you. You pay (cash only) and devour. Okay, sure, it's in the middle of the Tenderloin. Just watch where you step and you'll be fine. We braved SF traffic multiple times to stop at this specific spot during our trip and did not regret a single minute (or bite). Didn't get the chance to try too many of the fillings, but the roast pork is great despite being nontraditional. And that bread crackle... the perfectly pickled carrots+daikon... the meat/bread ratio... UGHHH. Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place. It is truly amazing.
Special combo for $4.25. The banh mi is packed to the brim with meat and topped with slightly pickled veggies. The bun is toasted and the sauces really help bring it all together. This small mom and pops Viet sub place is really da bomb. I couldn't find a good bowl of pho while here in San Fran, but if you're craving banh mi or just a bomb ass sandwich this place is forizzles.
I went to Saigon Sandwiches on a Friday around lunchtime as I saw it had the highest rating out of all the Vietnamese bánh mì sandwiches in the area.  When I walked by, I saw it had quite a crowd of people lined up to order, as well as a scatter of people waiting for their food.  I was a bit shocked to see the interior with 4 Vietnamese women quickly working in a bánh mì sandwich assembly line.  It didn't look like very sanitary conditions, but I still ordered a roast chicken sandwich for $3.75.  I was worried it would take a long time to get my order, but it was pretty fast (5-10 minutes).  I could see this getting out of hand with a lot more people because when I placed my order, the lady just wrote down my food without my name or without me even paying.  Then, she just called out "one roast chicken."  I had to look around to make sure it was my actual order and then paid.There is a small area at the front beside the cooler with two chairs you could sit and eat at, but with all of the people crowding inside, I wouldn't recommend this.  There is no seating outside, as well, so it's more of a "take-away" sandwich shop sort of thing.  When opening the wrapping to the sandwich, I saw how messy it was put together.  I wouldn't have minded waiting a bit longer if they made it less messy.  The bread was a bit too hard for me, and I can see it hurting the top of people's mouths when biting down.  Overall, the sandwich was ok, but you can't really complain about that price.  I think that's the only reason why this place has such a high rating.  I eat a lot of bánh mì sandwiches personally, and this place definitely was not matching what Yelp had me believe it should be.  Maybe I came on an off day?  I'm highly disappointed to read on Yelp that this is the best bánh mì sandwich in San Francisco; that's unacceptable.What I ordered:-Roast Chicken Bánh Mì Sandwich ($3.75)Pros:-Very inexpensiveCons:-Sketchy neighborhood with many homeless people-Looks unsanitary in the interior-Messy sandwich-Bread is too hard-No comfortable seating area (take-away only)-Confusing ordering setup
Great. Great! I'm gonna humble brag or just plain brag about spending time and falling in love with Vietnam. I've had Bahn Mis from the likes of Anthony Bourdain's favorite joint in the beautiful city of Hoi An - OH MY GOD.Saigon sandwich - Damn. For 3.75 this place is really awesome. You will walk in and there will be literally nothing but hardworking folks serving up some great sandwiches. There will be people lining out the door because there's no room inside and also because we all want a Bahn Mi. A nice menu to choose from. I got the roasted pork. It had some fat on it that I had to strip away, but it was really delicious and really authentic. Would I come here again? No doubt.
Roast pork bahn mi for $3.75 is all you need to know. This place is fast, cheap, and good. I'm going to start coming here every single day for lunch.
Crunchy and delicious. What more could I ask for in a sandwich!?$3.75 for all the sandwiches. There's roast chicken, roast pork, siu mai, pate, and fanci pork. Now.. fanci pork sounds "fancy" but really... it's just a white slab of meat.I got lucky. When I got there, no line; when I left, the line appeared. Sandwich was prepped quickly. They give a really generous portion. Even eating 1/3 of a sandwich, I was full!!! I think my favorite was the roast chicken and siu mai. The roast pork tasted a little plain in my opinion but nevertheless, they were all delicious. SOOOOO coming back for more.BTW, the 31 stops half a block away. So if you are taking the bus, take that and be careful! So many homeless and crazies around.
BOMB. AS. EFF.There are a few banh mi places near Saigon and after trying them I can say it is the best without a doubt. I stopped by for lunch and picked up a roast pork sandwich for just $3.75. The pork, bread, and cilantro were all fresh and the meal has to be the best bang-for-buck I've seen since moving to San Francisco. Heads up: There was a line at lunch but it moved quickly. They are cash only but the shop next door has an ATM.
Not sure what happened, but my banh mi (combo version) wasn't quite as I'd remembered it to be.  Yes, the bread was wonderfully crusty, and yes, there was a thin layer of pate...But it just didn't taste as good as I remembered.  They were pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon...perhaps that was the reason it wasn't so awesome.  Hopefully it'll be better next time?
Miraculously, it seemed, we arrived at 1pm on a Saturday to nary another human being. Within minutes of our arrival, an unceasing line had formed out the door. What was everyone ordering? Oh the special combo, the roast pork, or the chicken. Good signs, I'd say, as we also got the special combo and roast pork.I'd say they were both good choices. However, an in between sandwich would be best for me. One with that delicious pate and roast pork only. Also, is it just me or is this sandwich missing that dikon that is so ubiquitous? And thank goodness there's not a lot of mayo. Yuck.Anyway, a contender for the sandwich bracket for sure.

Either way, the combination sandwich this time was short of spectacular. The meat fillings, definitely the pate, were delicious, but the bread could use some work. The bread was borderline tough/stale, leaving much room to desire some flakey crisp bread during each bite.
Perfect banh mi for a perfect price! Just... Be careful. Area can be tricky!I go here for lunches. The roasted pork banh mi is an incredible steal at under $5. The service is quick, but this is basically a grab-and-go shop. Little to no seating, and you have to be careful, given the homeless population around the Tenderloin (oftentimes, they can be aggressive... It's sad, but just be careful and vigilant about your belongings, and find a nice charity to give to.)The food, though, is excellent. They also have a small range of Asian pastries and snacks. Highly, highly recommended*!*With the above caveats...
We all know that a place with this many reviews and this many stars might be worth trying out.  It's the coveted banh mi after all.  For less than $5, you can get one that will cool down your banh mi blood cells.To avoid the lunchtime line, I stopped by around 7:30am and was a solo customer.  Will it still be good by 12pm though?  I'm sure my combo banh mi tasted even better while at its freshest, but I cannot deny the cheerful forest animals that pranced around me while I took each bite.Once unwrapped, my sandwich was bursting with filling, a nimiety of bright green and orange.  A very happy banh mi I'd say.A happy banh mi with patê so rich, meat so soft and bits of fat that were hardly the chewy type I loathe.  The sliced peppers stung my lips, yet the pain urged me to take another bite of pickled flavors and the myriad of prepared pork.  They each tasted unique, but together, they were a group hug from longtime friends that were just meant for each other.  Even the bear of a bread appeared tough on the browned exterior.  Through the crispy shell there is an inviting bed of dough, a perfect resting place for the other pieces that make this banh mi dac biet one of the best I have ever experienced.Maybe I'm just deprived of good banh mi in Dallas.  Even so, I have this memory to fall back on whenever I try to enjoy one back home.
Came here yesterday to get a banh mi after visiting the Asian Art Museum. It was raining cats and dogs, so thankfully there wasn't a long wait at all. The banh mi are mostly $3.75 each, although there are a few other banh mi that are a bit more. Cash only, and tax is included in the price of the sandwich. It's a bit pricier than what I am used to paying for a banh mi (usually I pay around 2.50-3$), but the banh mi here are pretty gosh darn good. I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (also known as a bánh mì thi.t nu*ó*ng), which was loaded with meat and pickled veggies, and laden with a rich, thick meaty 'dark sauce'. Usually banh mi is accompanied with Maggi sauce, but their 'dark sauce' was definitely something... something out of this world! The flavor, quality and dense packed nature of the banh mi is definitely worth the $3.75.  As described by previous reviewers, Saigon Sandwich is a take-out kind of place.  First of all, you're likely going to not be able to sit down and eat as there is limited seating (two seats only!) and table space. There are also no bathrooms either.  Secondly, homeless tend to stand outside of Saigon's doorway.  They don't bother me, but it was a little sad/uncomfortable eating my sandwich inside Saigon Sandwich knowing they were probably hungry as they saw me and others eating away.Lastly, there happened to be a few sparrows that were seeking refuge inside Saigon, probably to keep dry from the pouring rain and to try to find some food scraps to eat. These sparrows were definitely NOT shy -- one of the sparrows actually crawled and flew on my hair and then later climbed and crawled onto my leg. I always thought sparrows looked cute, but this one was pretty bold. It was definitely SPARROW VS. MAN.  Who would be able to win for the last bite of banh mi...sparrow or man?  While I do love mother nature and the great outdoors, it was kind of annoying having to guard/shield my food so it wouldn't be eaten by the sparrow.Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.  If you don't want your food to be eaten up my bold and daring sparrows, I recommend you to take your sandwich to go!
Delicious banh mi, without the frills.I came here, not terribly hungry, having eaten at Brenda's nearby not more than a few hours before. Nonetheless, I had been meaning to try Saigon Sandwich for a while now, and being so close to where I was staying, I felt I had to pay a visit.The special combination (roast pork, pork loaf, and pate) banh mi is absolutely delicious. A freshly toasted baguette, stuffed with tender roast pork, with a generous spread of pate, and finally stuffed with thinly-sliced carrots, jalapenos, and cilantro. The crustiness of the baguette, the softness and chewiness of the meat, and the crunch of the vegetables all come together for a great and filling meal. You know it's good when the juices are running down your arm and you just don't care. You have to think about how quality the ingredients might be, but since the sandwiches are so tasty, it's easy to forget that you might not be getting the absolute best pork/bread/vegetables available in SF.Vegetarians can also come for the tofu banh mi, which I was told was delicious as well. The couple ahead of me told me that they swore by the tofu banh mi for years, so that's gotta stand for something.As for service, the ladies behind the counter aren't the friendliest in the world, but they do work incredibly efficiently, churn out sandwiches like clockwork, and are surprisingly patient with special requests, so that's really all you can hope for. Also, there is no questioning that the value is outstanding. For a fully loaded banh mi, I'd expect to pay about $6-8, but almost all banh mis are about $4, which is absolutely unheard of in this day and age. I'm not complaining at all, but it's crazy! I have a hard time finding no-frills banh mi in New York, and even the less expensive places are at least $8-10 for a sandwich. Note that it is cash only. A must-visit for both banh mi aficionados and value hounds alike. Given that I typically stay around Hayes Valley/Van Ness, I'll definitely be back if I want a great cheap meal.
Wow!! Talk about the perfect home-comfort hearty delicious sandwich. Much respect and love to the Vietnamese and French fusion that brought about the Banh Mi. Everything is delicious here -- as in all 4 menu items. I definitely recommend the Combo Banh Mi that has chicken, pork, and pate. Or just the Chicken Banh Mi. Or both! For $4.75/ sandwich -- you should just get two or three or more! Chicken is sweet and juicy, almost like teriyaki. Baguettes are toasted beautifully. Pickled carrots and garnished are refreshing, sweet, and tangy. The ladies here definitely mastered their Banh Mi craft!! It's amazing!
This place is good for quick Vietnamese sandwiches.  Saigon style authentic  sandwiches.  All $3.75.  Don't try the tofu if your  vegetarian. It's delicious but it's basted in meat sauce.   Always a long line for lunch but it moves quickly.
OMG best bahn mi ever. $3.75. It was Sunday and there was a short line out the door but it went fast. There were some other first-timers there too. A regular said roast pork and chicken were best. The french roll at been toasted to crunchy goodness and was super tasty. I got the roast pork which was very thinly sliced and yummy. Very nice sauce, lots of veggies and cilantro. I could have used extra jalepenos but I didn't think this wasy not the place for custom orders. That said, I heard someone order tofu, which wasn't on the menu, so I'm going to try that next time.I also got the goo in the cup (purple) and some sliced coconut goo as well. It was super fresh and was sitting on the counter, not refrigerated, so it was especially yummy.
Finallllllly got here in time to try the banh mi spot that everyone and their mama swears by. Verdict? MMMMMM!The combination special includes a generous portion of chicken, pork loaf, pate, and the usual pickled veggie culprits. Proteins were spot on... juicy, flavorful, and overall good eats. But beyond that, a few other things stood out as well. I liked that it wasn't too bready. Whereas some banh mi joints tend to leave a lot of the bread crumb intact, Saigon Sandwich does right by the customer in taking it out. Also, the picked veggies are julienned much thinner than your standard banh mi joint. It was a welcomed change in texture providing just enough fresh crunch, but not too much. For four bucks and some change? I'll take three more sandwiches to go, please *clap emoji.*
So good, no line at 11:30 am, no need for details, even the bread was hot!Fast and friendly service.I can't wait to go again. I'm stuffed for $4.25
How can sandwiches get better than this? As everyone can see - $3.75. Made in literal seconds. The ladies ask you if you want pate or not and then a perfectly wrapped, beautifully seasoned banh mi is handed to you. You pay (cash only) and devour. Okay, sure, it's in the middle of the Tenderloin. Just watch where you step and you'll be fine. We braved SF traffic multiple times to stop at this specific spot during our trip and did not regret a single minute (or bite). Didn't get the chance to try too many of the fillings, but the roast pork is great despite being nontraditional. And that bread crackle... the perfectly pickled carrots+daikon... the meat/bread ratio... UGHHH. Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place. It is truly amazing.
Special combo for $4.25. The banh mi is packed to the brim with meat and topped with slightly pickled veggies. The bun is toasted and the sauces really help bring it all together. This small mom and pops Viet sub place is really da bomb. I couldn't find a good bowl of pho while here in San Fran, but if you're craving banh mi or just a bomb ass sandwich this place is forizzles.
I went to Saigon Sandwiches on a Friday around lunchtime as I saw it had the highest rating out of all the Vietnamese bánh mì sandwiches in the area.  When I walked by, I saw it had quite a crowd of people lined up to order, as well as a scatter of people waiting for their food.  I was a bit shocked to see the interior with 4 Vietnamese women quickly working in a bánh mì sandwich assembly line.  It didn't look like very sanitary conditions, but I still ordered a roast chicken sandwich for $3.75.  I was worried it would take a long time to get my order, but it was pretty fast (5-10 minutes).  I could see this getting out of hand with a lot more people because when I placed my order, the lady just wrote down my food without my name or without me even paying.  Then, she just called out "one roast chicken."  I had to look around to make sure it was my actual order and then paid.There is a small area at the front beside the cooler with two chairs you could sit and eat at, but with all of the people crowding inside, I wouldn't recommend this.  There is no seating outside, as well, so it's more of a "take-away" sandwich shop sort of thing.  When opening the wrapping to the sandwich, I saw how messy it was put together.  I wouldn't have minded waiting a bit longer if they made it less messy.  The bread was a bit too hard for me, and I can see it hurting the top of people's mouths when biting down.  Overall, the sandwich was ok, but you can't really complain about that price.  I think that's the only reason why this place has such a high rating.  I eat a lot of bánh mì sandwiches personally, and this place definitely was not matching what Yelp had me believe it should be.  Maybe I came on an off day?  I'm highly disappointed to read on Yelp that this is the best bánh mì sandwich in San Francisco; that's unacceptable.What I ordered:-Roast Chicken Bánh Mì Sandwich ($3.75)Pros:-Very inexpensiveCons:-Sketchy neighborhood with many homeless people-Looks unsanitary in the interior-Messy sandwich-Bread is too hard-No comfortable seating area (take-away only)-Confusing ordering setup
Great. Great! I'm gonna humble brag or just plain brag about spending time and falling in love with Vietnam. I've had Bahn Mis from the likes of Anthony Bourdain's favorite joint in the beautiful city of Hoi An - OH MY GOD.Saigon sandwich - Damn. For 3.75 this place is really awesome. You will walk in and there will be literally nothing but hardworking folks serving up some great sandwiches. There will be people lining out the door because there's no room inside and also because we all want a Bahn Mi. A nice menu to choose from. I got the roasted pork. It had some fat on it that I had to strip away, but it was really delicious and really authentic. Would I come here again? No doubt.
Roast pork bahn mi for $3.75 is all you need to know. This place is fast, cheap, and good. I'm going to start coming here every single day for lunch.
Crunchy and delicious. What more could I ask for in a sandwich!?$3.75 for all the sandwiches. There's roast chicken, roast pork, siu mai, pate, and fanci pork. Now.. fanci pork sounds "fancy" but really... it's just a white slab of meat.I got lucky. When I got there, no line; when I left, the line appeared. Sandwich was prepped quickly. They give a really generous portion. Even eating 1/3 of a sandwich, I was full!!! I think my favorite was the roast chicken and siu mai. The roast pork tasted a little plain in my opinion but nevertheless, they were all delicious. SOOOOO coming back for more.BTW, the 31 stops half a block away. So if you are taking the bus, take that and be careful! So many homeless and crazies around.
BOMB. AS. EFF.There are a few banh mi places near Saigon and after trying them I can say it is the best without a doubt. I stopped by for lunch and picked up a roast pork sandwich for just $3.75. The pork, bread, and cilantro were all fresh and the meal has to be the best bang-for-buck I've seen since moving to San Francisco. Heads up: There was a line at lunch but it moved quickly. They are cash only but the shop next door has an ATM.
Not sure what happened, but my banh mi (combo version) wasn't quite as I'd remembered it to be.  Yes, the bread was wonderfully crusty, and yes, there was a thin layer of pate...But it just didn't taste as good as I remembered.  They were pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon...perhaps that was the reason it wasn't so awesome.  Hopefully it'll be better next time?
Miraculously, it seemed, we arrived at 1pm on a Saturday to nary another human being. Within minutes of our arrival, an unceasing line had formed out the door. What was everyone ordering? Oh the special combo, the roast pork, or the chicken. Good signs, I'd say, as we also got the special combo and roast pork.I'd say they were both good choices. However, an in between sandwich would be best for me. One with that delicious pate and roast pork only. Also, is it just me or is this sandwich missing that dikon that is so ubiquitous? And thank goodness there's not a lot of mayo. Yuck.Anyway, a contender for the sandwich bracket for sure.
Best sandwiches in the area for sure!The bread is fresh, the meat (I love the chicken but the pork is great too) is amazing, and the people are friendly even though they don't understand English very well. That's kind of an understatement, you often need to repeat your order even if it is just one simple sandwich. For only $3.75 though, it's totally amazing.Most of the time you have to wait in line, but they work really fast so you rarely need to wait more than five minutes. Which is totally worth it!Oh, and the area is kinda sketchy but that's not this place's fault.
