If you are in San Francisco, be sure to fit in this half hour bookbinding tour. Far more interesting than it sounds, your extremely friendly, passionate, knowledgable tour guide will break down the history of how knowledge disseminated  through the centuries and across continents. I left there feeling as if I had just finished a great book on the rise of technology, culture, and literacy on a global level. I had no idea how much the practice of binding books would tell me about human behavior. Despite its small size, this museum is possibly one of my favorites of all time because of the quality of the tour. Cannot recommend highly enough.
After seeing hints of their lovely collection at several Antiquarian Book Fairs, I finally took the plunge and visited. Admittedly, as an avid lover of books and all things associated with their history, I may be biased but this place is BREATHTAKING. Through their unmatched collection of machines and ephemera, they offer an unforgettable glimpse into the history of the book. Whether experienced from the eyes of a child or an adult, there is something you will discover that will ruminate within you leaving you with this urge to come back for a bit more. Much respect to the founder, Tim James, for putting his passion to the best possible use.
This is a wonderful museum! Make time to visit. We wandered in while visiting San Francisco and took up an unreasonable amount of time with questions for the knowledgable and gracious proprietor. Everyone we met seemed genuinely happy to take the time to help us understand more about a craft that they know and appreciate. You'll learn things you never knew you didn't know about books. The most informative, personal, and interactive tour I've been on in recent memory.
Now located at 355 Clementina!This place is truly wonderful.Docent led tours take you through the history of a surprising number of book binding and printing equipment (much of which is still functional and happily demonstrated). The people working here are clearly not only knowledgable, but passionate about the art of book binding. This is a great museum for both adults and *in my opinion as an elementary art educator* small groups of young students (probably over the age of 10, depending on behavior and supervision -- due to the very large/heavy/valuable freestanding equipment).They even have an exhibit of hand-bound book arts, which is fantastic.
As stated previously, the entrance is on Clementina St. Great little museum and Tim was a wonderful docent. Very interesting history of bookbinding through the Industrial Age. I learned quite a bit!  Did you know that page edge marbling was actually done in ledgers for security purposes? Learn all about that and other interesting information.  Docent tours are at 10:00 and 2:00 and take about an hour.  Check it out!
Several centuries from now, we may have iPad-Kindle-Nook museums. Till then, contemporary humankind reflects on the journey of the bound paper format known as the book.Currently in a partial layout till November for which full-blown book display and machine demos are in the works, the docent-led tour is fairly linear from the front to the back of the space. A technological timeline as well as the bookmaking process are somewhat ingrained into the narration. My tour was an hour and a half; yours will depend on your level of interest and asking questions.If you're an AAU student in the Book Arts classes, if you like SF Center for the Book, if you're a librarian, if you memorized the phone book and / or tore it apart with your bare hands... I highly suggest calling to set up a visit. For other appreciators of art, this place is worth a look.
