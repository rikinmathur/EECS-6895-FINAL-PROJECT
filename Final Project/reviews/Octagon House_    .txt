It's not 5 stars because nothing was during the Civil War however this is a cool little house and I think one of only 8 in the country..It's a must see and it cost only $3 to get in.
I went here ages ago... Thought it was kind of cool though I can't recall much about its contents - which makes me feel like this is a relatively useless review... Haha. I just remember seeing the interior design and some historical artifacts. Definitely interesting if you're into that kind of thing...
I've lived down the street from this place for 6 years. I finally made a point to visit since I'm moving away. I arrived about 45 minutes before they closed which wasn't nearly enough time. If you're into history, allow an hour minimum to explore. The docents were wonderful! They explained the history of every item in the house and had additional info on genealogy and SF history. The decor is from the federalist period which doesn't quite align with the house's era but it all makes sense once you learn about the organization that runs the museum. They are items you normally only see on the east coast so I was interested to learn about something different. Upstairs, they have signatures of 54 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence on various correspondence and letters. If you're an American History buff, you could spend an hour in that room alone. I saw so many books lining the shelves, including full family histories. No time to even open one of them.So much history and information for a modest $4 requested donation. Be warned, they close promptly and will usher you out. Arrive when they open to give yourself plenty of time!PS No photography allowed inside unfortunately.
I have mixed feelings about the Octagon House and here's why: architecturally it's really unique but much of the internal layout / artifacts are not actually representative of the time period. Meh. On the positive side, the women that volunteer in the house are SUPER knowledgeable and after getting into a conversation with one of them I was really able to appreciate the history of the house and the different artifacts the women have collected. One neat thing about the house - The original owner of the house built a time capsule  and you can read the letter he included in it. The letter is really interesting in itself (as it was written during Licoln's presidency) although it's a bit disappointing that the original owner was a huge racist (as noted in his letter).Bottom line - if you happen to be in the neighborhood and the house happens to be open (it's only open several hours / month) then stop in and make sure to get a tour from one of the volunteers.
I just happened to stop by here today, and noticed it was only open 3 days a month for 3 hours on each of those days, so I figured I had to go in.  It was free and everybody inside was really knowledgeable and explained everything in the house.  You could ask anything and they would either know the answer or find someone that did.  Lots of interesting artifacts and pictures in here.  I don't think I would stop by if I was vacationing in SF, but as a local I think it is well worth the stop, if you manage to catch them while they are open.  They have a great volunteer staff.
If you're like me, you've probably been passing this place for years and never given it much thought -- aside from its curious shape. Actually, it is a museum, housing some slightly intriguing artifacts and documents ... and some real snoozers. I found myself far more interested in the building itself, of which they provide a lot of good information. Architecturally-speaking, this was a five-star stop, so if you're a structural nut (like me), it might be worth a look. But the collections are rather underwhelming and its hours of operation are flat-out bizarre, thus ultimately landing somewhere right in the middle. All in all, though, I am really glad it exists.
my buddy lives across the street from this place.  it's only open on something like the second Tuesday of every third month between 1-2pm. That's why i was shocked when, on my last visit, it was open! of course we venture out in the cold to check it out....walked in, found out cost was $3, looked EXCITING inside, not,( more like my grandmas house) and walked out. not the funnest thing to do in SF. My buddy did once see a homeless guy hop the fence and steel all the flowers to sell on the street.
One of five such houses in early San Francisco, this was built by William C. McElroy in 1861. Its design was based on a popular theory that people living in a space of this shape would live healthier, happier lives . . . sort of a forerunner to feng sui. In 1951, when The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in California (imagine that letterhead on their stationery!) acquired the building, it was on the opposite side of Gough. Vacant for many years, it was in a state of disrepair, and its owner was happy to accept the Society's offer to move and restore it, and the cornerstone was laid at the new location in 1953. In 1968, it was designated an Historical Landmark by the city, and in 1972 it was placed in the National Register of Historic Places. Now a museum, its collection represents decorative arts of the Colonial and Federal periods, and includes furniture, portraits, samplers,  silver and pewter, Chinese ceramics, and Oriental carpets. Also on display is a collection of documents pertaining to Colonial and Early American history. It's open to the public only on the second Sunday and the second and fourth Thursdays of each month except January from noon to 3:00pm, so a visit requires careful planning. Free admission, although a contribution toward maintenance is appreciated. History buffs and architecture fans will find it fascinating.
