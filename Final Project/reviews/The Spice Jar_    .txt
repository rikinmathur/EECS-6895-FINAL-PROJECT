4.5 stars. Fantastic place for lunch. This restaurant is tucked away in an area where tourists are rare and only local people frequent. The space is open and sunny with a board with a quote by Julia child:" the people who love food are the best people." That essence is carried all throughout the restaurant, from the details of the decor to the items to the menu. A sense of energy and buzz immediately hits you when you enter. (vs the overbearing noise associated with popular restaurants)There is a definitive California flair to the Asian fusion interpretation here. Japanese, Chinese, and Thai influence set the foundation for the menu items. However, instead of the greasy spoon alternatives and bastardization that often make FOB Asians cringe,  the chef has combined different elements to reinterpret and make it downright comfort food for many. I would probably stick with the noodle dishes (tonkotsu and spicy miso pork ramen) and salad dishes. Given my Chinese background, I am probably harsher on the dishes like the Mongolian beef that has a bit too much sauce.
3.5Very cute asian restaurant at the corner of 23rd and Bryant. When we arrived for lunch on a Fri afternoon, the restaurant (albeit very limited seating and space) was completely packed. We opted to sit outside and brave the wind. Unfortunately, they do not serve hot sake but have plenty of cold sake to choose from. Started with a mint tea, shumai and garlic green beans. Tea and green beans were delicious! Shumai was a bit flavorless and I had to drench mine in a bit of soy sauce.Next came the entree - TONKOTSU-SHOYU RAMEN!!Ramen and broth were delicious!! The egg was average. The pork sparerib was a huge portion and very tender, but not too much flavor. Service was very good and prompt (except for forgetting to bring us some chili paste for the ramen when we first asked). Would love to come back and try some other dishes. I was pretty thirsty after the meal which usually indicates a lot of sodium and/or MSG in the meal :(Love that they store utensils and napkins at the table in empty tins of Cafe Du Monde coffee!!
We came on a weeknight and it was packed.  The restaurant was small, and I recall seeing 2 large tables with small parties sitting together, and a few smaller tables for parties of 2.  We didn't want to wait so we ordered our items to go and we may have waited for 20 minutes for our food.  The restaurant was small and cute.  There were lots of bigger parties, but it seemed like it would make a good, loud, date spot.  Yelp says it was kid friendly, but I wouldn't want to squeeze my toddler in there.  At the same time, I did see another toddler inside with a high chair so it does seem like they can accomodate smaller children.We ordered ramen, pork buns, and fried rice.  The ramen was neatly placed in the to go boxes with soup separated.  The pork buns looked a bit of a disaster in our to go box.  Our buns were soggy from the sauce and meat, the box seemed oversized which caused the food to juggle.  Perhaps, it's not meant for it to be taken out.  I don't have any complaints about my fried rice, but it wasn't special and it wasn't spicy as I thought it would be.They were quick to assist me with the pick up order even though they were extremely busy.  When I placed the order, the server had to step out to escape the noise.  This place may be a bit too trendy for me to visit, and too messy for me to take out.
YUM!We came for lunch today (Saturday). We were there early, so we were the first customers when they opened. We were the only customers while we were there.The woman who helped us was so very kind. We started with plum wine and what?!?! Jalapeño Plum Wine? Yep! I didn't get it, but Mark did. I took a sip. It was good! Oh... my plum wine was SUPER sweet. Plum wine is supposed to be sweet, but this was almost shockingly sweet. I did enjoy it, but asked for a Chardonnay as a follow up.We started with Albacore Carpaccio. What a stunning dish! The presentation was gorgeous and the taste was fantastic. The jalapeño was not too hot, the ponzu sauce complimented the fish so well. And I don't know what was served on top... something that looked fried... very small slivers of fried something? I should have asked; it didn't say on the menu. Anyway.. FANTASTIC. Get it!Mark got the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen. He really enjoyed it.I got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with the braised spare rib. It was really quite good. People have commented on the egg and while I agree I'd expect the yellow to be runny, the description on the menu says boiled egg... and it is boiled. So that's the way they serve it. Works for me. I thought the noodles were delicious. The beef was tender. The broth had a wonderful, beef flavor. I thought it was very good.I'd like to try The Spice Jar for dinner because the dinner menu has more options. Plus it might be fun to check out the evening vibe. From the reviews it seems this place is hopping in the evening. For Saturday lunch... it was super slow. Go visit them... they deserve the business.
My girlfriend and I had seen photos of this place in Instagram and were intrigued to try it out. With two kiddos in tow we hoped for a quick but delicious lunch.They were extremely kid friendly. Although limited with space and rather packed for lunch, they accommodated us and allowed us space for a stroller. Service was very prompt.We shared the nori French fries (3/5) and each got a noodle dish- the laksa (3/5) and tonkatsu Shoyu ramen (2/5)The French fries were decent. Freshly fried but lacked garlic flavor.The laksa was creamy and seafood portions were sufficient. The tonkatsu ramen was flavorful and rich. The braised spare rib was a bit tough to eat and a bit chewy. The soft boiled egg was NOT a soft boiled egg. It was a boiled egg. Decent spot for a bite. Not sure if it was good enough for me to go back.
The Spice Jar was an accidental discovery trying to find dinner in San Francisco, and accidents don't have to be a bad thing.Tagged as "Asian Comfort Food," you would ordinarily expect the most kitsch-y thing ever, something like a cross of P.F. Chang's and Roscoe's. The Spice Jar is not that at all. Rather, it's more of a nice family owned restaurant, and it has a really nice vibe. It's both trendy yet somehow rather comforting.Most of the items on the menu are pretty solid - I will note that beef anything is really good. I will note that with all trendy restaurants, portion sizes leave a bit to be desired. You won't be stuffed here, that's for sure, but you could be amply full if you choose the right items.Probably the most interesting thing here is the 1L Asahi (actually something like 0.946 liters). That thing is massive and is good to share or even have alone.What I found really nice about the restaurant is the size of the kitchen and the service. You see their vast menu, you see their tiny kitchen, you see the workers running around everywhere, and you really feel the effort and care in what they're doing. It's amazing what they can accomplish with a kitchen that small.I'd definitely come here again.TIP: Get the Asahi.
I'm not one for Asian food in hipster areas but this place was surprisingly good!Located in an up and coming area on the less busy Bryant Street in the Mission District is this cute and intimate spot. It's a bit cramped in here so not the best place for a big group. Can look like it's filling up quickly but the turnaround seems fast. Also a lot of take-out orders too so the kitchen is a bit slow.. a good 6 workers or so for this restaurant which can only fit probably like 25-30 people.... but the wait for your food will be worth it, I promise.The workers are all extremely friendly but service may be a bit absent as they ARE busy - responsive when called though.Me and my friend tried quite a few items between the two of us and the only dish I would NOT recommend is the calamari salad.Spare rib bao - as many have stated, it comes as just one meaty rib still on the bone. I was scared it was going to be a bit messy but it was literally fall off the bone tender. Definitely one of the most tender ribs I've had. It was flavored thoroughly! The pickled cucumbers were thickly and roughly chopped, I wish it was cut more thinly, slightly more acidic, and less sweet. Still a very good appetizer - I just wish it came with 2 ribs :(Chicken kara age (not on the online menu) - YASSSSSSS. Crispy (and stayed crispy) and perfectly seasoned. Lightly battered and came with 8-10 decent sized pieces. Would be perfect with beer.Crispy calamari salad - judging from how crispy and delicious the chicken was, I thought it would be the same for the calamari.. The calamari was soggy and didn't taste seasoned :/ The calamari ratio was about 3:1 with the greens, which would normally be a good thing, but it just wasn't GOOD. The red curry honey dressing was pretty nonexistent - kind of like a really watery honey with some spice - I don't think it complimented the salad.Zen noodle soup - I don't usually like noodle soups with seafood because I don't like sea-foody tasting broths - but this was delicious! Very light tasting broth, delicate coconut flavor and just very, very slightly sour and hot. So good! I could eat a million bowls of these. Came with a good portion of shrimp, mussels and calamari. I wish it came with more noodles!Overall, very solid Asian fusion place. Would love to return to try their ramens and would DEFINITELY get the bao and kara age again :)
Some of the best ramen I've had in a long long time! We absolutely loved this place. Came here on a Saturday night at 6:45pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes. By the time we left there was quite a line. It's a small little place with excellent service and fanatic ramen. I ordered the mint tea which was light and refreshing. My husband ordered the spicy sesame miso ramen which was very simple - just broth and ramen noodles. The broth was great with the right amount of spiciness and the noodles were oh so good and extremely fresh. I had the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Again the broth was fantastic and I loved how it wasn't super oily like other places. The service was great. They were very nice and quick with everything. The cost was great as well. Overall this place has everything - great food, great service all at a great cost.
Yummy! Came here on a Sunday and the wait was not too bad. For our party of 4, we waited about 15 min. The location is very tiny so think ahead if you are planning on coming with a big party. The decor was very nice and cute. The staff was great. They were very attentive and friendly.My party and I ordered a bunch of small bites and couple main dishes and everything was tasty! I especially liked the garlic fried rice and Mongolian lamb. Overall I will definitely recommend!
3.5 STARS for a cute and above average Asian Fusion (I think?) spot owned by super friendly Asian folks. I came for brunch, and they have several small shareable plates and entrees, and a very extensive drink list.* SHU MAI - 3.5 stars:Homemade and meaty, but the wrappers were soggy and oversteamed. I liked that they tasted healthy and was well seasoned, but I have to admit I prefer the type at dingy dim sum restaurants because they have more flavor (I know they are chock full of MSG and preservatives....)* TONKATSU RAMEN - 3.5 stars:Decent broth and noodles, AHH-mazingly tender pork rib. Not the best ramen but a really good option for SF standards! * SEAWEED SALAD - 3.5 stars:Enormous portion of spring greens topped with seaweed salad and a soy-apply dressing. A little salty for my liking - ask for dressing on the side.
This weekend, we ventured out to another unfamiliar neighborhood to try out some new food. Through yelp, we found "The Spice Jar." Normally, I try to stay away from places that have too many cuisines going on at the same time. This restaurant serves Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Italian(?). However, this place has raving reviews and yelpers suggested to try everything on the menu. Sure enough, this restaurant lives up to all the great reviews. The food didn't disappoint, especially the Albacore carpaccio and tonkatsu ramen. In fact, I think this is one of the best ramen I've had in the city. The chef came and asked us about the food. I later found out the chef is the owner of the restaurant. He traveled all over Asia and picked out the best represented dish from each country.  What amazing talent to replicate the different cuisines and make it his own.We all had a great experience here. Great food, friendly service, and cozy atmosphere. We'd definitely come back to try out their other dishes.
Came here for lunch with some friends. The lunch menu is a tad different than the dinner one. Food: I got the Mongolian Beef with bread. Very tasty and flavorful. Not as big as I thought (I'm a big eater) but it was filling enough. Wife got the Tonkasu Ramen. Freaking Bomb! Broth was perfect and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Also got the pork dumplings. These were so so. Garlic fries were also good. Service: on point.  Small trendy little place in a neighborhood. Friendly staff. Will definitely come back to try the dinner menu. Prices are reasonable.
Cute little pan-Asian restaurant on the corner of 23rd and Bryant that is a perfect place for a reasonably priced lunch. The place is little that can get pretty packed. Seating may also be communal.The Zen Noodle soup was delicious. It was a coconut/samal based broth with an assortment of seafood that was sweet and tangy. The tonkatsu ramen was also amazing with the meat falling right off the bone. Definitely a must try!
The Mongolian Beef is what you'd expect and tasty, but I think overpriced compared to what you could get at other asian restaurants. The Spicy Sesame Ramen was decent. My favorite was the Crispy Calamari Salad, but I don't know if I loved it enough to go back just for that item. I'd maybe return when I have more money to spare! :P
The Spice Jar is a relatively new Asian spot in the Mission, bringing homey comfort food from all different Asian cuisines. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion because they somehow bring in distinct flavors from each culture in an authentic way. My boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday, and ended up waiting almost half an hour for a table, which goes to show just how popular it is. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps, a simple dish but full of flavor. I loved the addition of the mushroom with the minced chicken, helping to cut the natural saltiness of the dish. We also tried the har gao, which was definitely on the doughier side but great in terms of portion size. For entrees, we had the tonkatsu ramen and the Spice Jar fried rice. The flavor of the ramen broth was amazing as it tasted like the pork had been stewing for hours. The fried rice was generous in shrimp and chicken portions, but definitely a little too salty for me. Overall, it tasted as close to home-cooked as you can get from a restaurant in the city!
Some people say, "variety is the spice of life". To me, that just means quantity over quality--like buffets. They usually suck and give you bubble guts.Then, you have Pan Asian restaurants that serve popular dishes from various Asian countries. Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. After seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. We ordered the following:*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): bit.ly/1NaltR6*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): bit.ly/1LUlGaS*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, sautéed veggies ($18): bit.ly/1NNmzCD*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): bit.ly/1KI2tb0Based on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. The Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. The Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. The Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. The Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.Service was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. The Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. Parking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.The Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.
I'm usually quite wary of Asian "fusion" restaurants, as it seems to cater towards a crowd unused to specific cuisines. The interior design is very cosy, country home; while adorable, it almost reinforced my expectation of an underwhelming experience, due to cognitive dissonance. That being said, The Spice Jar pleasantly surprised me. I sampled an assortment of dishes and enjoyed all of them.I started with the Crispy Calamari Salad--a generous portion of fresh greens, topped with delicious, lightly breaded calamari and red honey curry dressing. The little critters were crisped perfectly and didn't overpower or wilt the salad leaves.I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen next, and also loved it. I'm used to eating delicious ramen at food trucks, but this was truly a treat. The rib was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the broth was flavorful and substantial without being too salty. The noodles were cooked just right, with a bit of bite to them. The hard boiled egg was done just right too. The couple who owns the restaurant are truly charming and wonderful. I've eaten here a few different times, and in recognizing me, they brought some Aonori Garlic Fries on the house. Yum! I was happy to see, upon my more recent visit, that they'd hired some wait staff. I can't imagine how insane opening weeks must have been with just the two of them doing all of the work--from cooking, to waiting on tables, busing, etc. The interior design is worth mentioning again, because it is so unexpectedly adorable. The bottom of tables are adorned with material that feels like mattress topper--it prevents you from bruising yourself while shifting your legs. I almost want all the restaurants I go to to adopt this methodology. I'm so clumsy, it definitely saved me on multiple occasions.Definitely eat here.
We had a fantastic meal here on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9PM and still waited about 20 minutes to get a table. Parking nearby was really tough to find. The ambiance on the inside is really small, warm, and cozy! The service was also very friendly. The food was fantastic and everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal. I had the red curry which was so decadent and I'd recommend if you're in the mood for Thai Curry. We will definitely be back! Only wish they took reservations, I hate waiting!
My husband ate at this establishment on Saturday night with his buddy. The next morning he had food poisoning. Please stay away from their salmon dish.Usually I like to give new hip places a chance, but after seeing my husband suffering the last couple of days, no thank you.
Found this spot by just walking around the neighborhood. The design/style caught my eye, especially the beautiful art/lighting piece in the center of the room. The menu has so many things that all sounded appealing. We went for a few things and split them. Portions are BIG! The Garlic Edamame was delicious but would only order if you want to share them between 3/4 people because it's a lot of edamame. The Tonkatsu Ramen tasted really fresh. Love the rib that comes in it. The meat practically falls off the bone and adds to the broth.The Mongolian Beef was tasty and nice to try it with bread - although I would have preferred it with rice. It's a great find though. Go before a line of Mission Techies find it.

This weekend, we ventured out to another unfamiliar neighborhood to try out some new food. Through yelp, we found "The Spice Jar." Normally, I try to stay away from places that have too many cuisines going on at the same time. This restaurant serves Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Italian(?). However, this place has raving reviews and yelpers suggested to try everything on the menu. Sure enough, this restaurant lives up to all the great reviews. The food didn't disappoint, especially the Albacore carpaccio and tonkatsu ramen. In fact, I think this is one of the best ramen I've had in the city. The chef came and asked us about the food. I later found out the chef is the owner of the restaurant. He traveled all over Asia and picked out the best represented dish from each country.  What amazing talent to replicate the different cuisines and make it his own.We all had a great experience here. Great food, friendly service, and cozy atmosphere. We'd definitely come back to try out their other dishes.
Came here for lunch with some friends. The lunch menu is a tad different than the dinner one. Food: I got the Mongolian Beef with bread. Very tasty and flavorful. Not as big as I thought (I'm a big eater) but it was filling enough. Wife got the Tonkasu Ramen. Freaking Bomb! Broth was perfect and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Also got the pork dumplings. These were so so. Garlic fries were also good. Service: on point.  Small trendy little place in a neighborhood. Friendly staff. Will definitely come back to try the dinner menu. Prices are reasonable.
Cute little pan-Asian restaurant on the corner of 23rd and Bryant that is a perfect place for a reasonably priced lunch. The place is little that can get pretty packed. Seating may also be communal.The Zen Noodle soup was delicious. It was a coconut/samal based broth with an assortment of seafood that was sweet and tangy. The tonkatsu ramen was also amazing with the meat falling right off the bone. Definitely a must try!
The Mongolian Beef is what you'd expect and tasty, but I think overpriced compared to what you could get at other asian restaurants. The Spicy Sesame Ramen was decent. My favorite was the Crispy Calamari Salad, but I don't know if I loved it enough to go back just for that item. I'd maybe return when I have more money to spare! :P
The Spice Jar is a relatively new Asian spot in the Mission, bringing homey comfort food from all different Asian cuisines. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion because they somehow bring in distinct flavors from each culture in an authentic way. My boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday, and ended up waiting almost half an hour for a table, which goes to show just how popular it is. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps, a simple dish but full of flavor. I loved the addition of the mushroom with the minced chicken, helping to cut the natural saltiness of the dish. We also tried the har gao, which was definitely on the doughier side but great in terms of portion size. For entrees, we had the tonkatsu ramen and the Spice Jar fried rice. The flavor of the ramen broth was amazing as it tasted like the pork had been stewing for hours. The fried rice was generous in shrimp and chicken portions, but definitely a little too salty for me. Overall, it tasted as close to home-cooked as you can get from a restaurant in the city!
Some people say, "variety is the spice of life". To me, that just means quantity over quality--like buffets. They usually suck and give you bubble guts.Then, you have Pan Asian restaurants that serve popular dishes from various Asian countries. Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. After seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. We ordered the following:*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): bit.ly/1NaltR6*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): bit.ly/1LUlGaS*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, sautéed veggies ($18): bit.ly/1NNmzCD*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): bit.ly/1KI2tb0Based on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. The Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. The Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. The Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. The Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.Service was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. The Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. Parking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.The Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.
I'm usually quite wary of Asian "fusion" restaurants, as it seems to cater towards a crowd unused to specific cuisines. The interior design is very cosy, country home; while adorable, it almost reinforced my expectation of an underwhelming experience, due to cognitive dissonance. That being said, The Spice Jar pleasantly surprised me. I sampled an assortment of dishes and enjoyed all of them.I started with the Crispy Calamari Salad--a generous portion of fresh greens, topped with delicious, lightly breaded calamari and red honey curry dressing. The little critters were crisped perfectly and didn't overpower or wilt the salad leaves.I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen next, and also loved it. I'm used to eating delicious ramen at food trucks, but this was truly a treat. The rib was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the broth was flavorful and substantial without being too salty. The noodles were cooked just right, with a bit of bite to them. The hard boiled egg was done just right too. The couple who owns the restaurant are truly charming and wonderful. I've eaten here a few different times, and in recognizing me, they brought some Aonori Garlic Fries on the house. Yum! I was happy to see, upon my more recent visit, that they'd hired some wait staff. I can't imagine how insane opening weeks must have been with just the two of them doing all of the work--from cooking, to waiting on tables, busing, etc. The interior design is worth mentioning again, because it is so unexpectedly adorable. The bottom of tables are adorned with material that feels like mattress topper--it prevents you from bruising yourself while shifting your legs. I almost want all the restaurants I go to to adopt this methodology. I'm so clumsy, it definitely saved me on multiple occasions.Definitely eat here.
We had a fantastic meal here on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9PM and still waited about 20 minutes to get a table. Parking nearby was really tough to find. The ambiance on the inside is really small, warm, and cozy! The service was also very friendly. The food was fantastic and everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal. I had the red curry which was so decadent and I'd recommend if you're in the mood for Thai Curry. We will definitely be back! Only wish they took reservations, I hate waiting!
My husband ate at this establishment on Saturday night with his buddy. The next morning he had food poisoning. Please stay away from their salmon dish.Usually I like to give new hip places a chance, but after seeing my husband suffering the last couple of days, no thank you.
Found this spot by just walking around the neighborhood. The design/style caught my eye, especially the beautiful art/lighting piece in the center of the room. The menu has so many things that all sounded appealing. We went for a few things and split them. Portions are BIG! The Garlic Edamame was delicious but would only order if you want to share them between 3/4 people because it's a lot of edamame. The Tonkatsu Ramen tasted really fresh. Love the rib that comes in it. The meat practically falls off the bone and adds to the broth.The Mongolian Beef was tasty and nice to try it with bread - although I would have preferred it with rice. It's a great find though. Go before a line of Mission Techies find it.
4.5 stars. Fantastic place for lunch. This restaurant is tucked away in an area where tourists are rare and only local people frequent. The space is open and sunny with a board with a quote by Julia child:" the people who love food are the best people." That essence is carried all throughout the restaurant, from the details of the decor to the items to the menu. A sense of energy and buzz immediately hits you when you enter. (vs the overbearing noise associated with popular restaurants)There is a definitive California flair to the Asian fusion interpretation here. Japanese, Chinese, and Thai influence set the foundation for the menu items. However, instead of the greasy spoon alternatives and bastardization that often make FOB Asians cringe,  the chef has combined different elements to reinterpret and make it downright comfort food for many. I would probably stick with the noodle dishes (tonkotsu and spicy miso pork ramen) and salad dishes. Given my Chinese background, I am probably harsher on the dishes like the Mongolian beef that has a bit too much sauce.
3.5Very cute asian restaurant at the corner of 23rd and Bryant. When we arrived for lunch on a Fri afternoon, the restaurant (albeit very limited seating and space) was completely packed. We opted to sit outside and brave the wind. Unfortunately, they do not serve hot sake but have plenty of cold sake to choose from. Started with a mint tea, shumai and garlic green beans. Tea and green beans were delicious! Shumai was a bit flavorless and I had to drench mine in a bit of soy sauce.Next came the entree - TONKOTSU-SHOYU RAMEN!!Ramen and broth were delicious!! The egg was average. The pork sparerib was a huge portion and very tender, but not too much flavor. Service was very good and prompt (except for forgetting to bring us some chili paste for the ramen when we first asked). Would love to come back and try some other dishes. I was pretty thirsty after the meal which usually indicates a lot of sodium and/or MSG in the meal :(Love that they store utensils and napkins at the table in empty tins of Cafe Du Monde coffee!!
We came on a weeknight and it was packed.  The restaurant was small, and I recall seeing 2 large tables with small parties sitting together, and a few smaller tables for parties of 2.  We didn't want to wait so we ordered our items to go and we may have waited for 20 minutes for our food.  The restaurant was small and cute.  There were lots of bigger parties, but it seemed like it would make a good, loud, date spot.  Yelp says it was kid friendly, but I wouldn't want to squeeze my toddler in there.  At the same time, I did see another toddler inside with a high chair so it does seem like they can accomodate smaller children.We ordered ramen, pork buns, and fried rice.  The ramen was neatly placed in the to go boxes with soup separated.  The pork buns looked a bit of a disaster in our to go box.  Our buns were soggy from the sauce and meat, the box seemed oversized which caused the food to juggle.  Perhaps, it's not meant for it to be taken out.  I don't have any complaints about my fried rice, but it wasn't special and it wasn't spicy as I thought it would be.They were quick to assist me with the pick up order even though they were extremely busy.  When I placed the order, the server had to step out to escape the noise.  This place may be a bit too trendy for me to visit, and too messy for me to take out.
YUM!We came for lunch today (Saturday). We were there early, so we were the first customers when they opened. We were the only customers while we were there.The woman who helped us was so very kind. We started with plum wine and what?!?! Jalapeño Plum Wine? Yep! I didn't get it, but Mark did. I took a sip. It was good! Oh... my plum wine was SUPER sweet. Plum wine is supposed to be sweet, but this was almost shockingly sweet. I did enjoy it, but asked for a Chardonnay as a follow up.We started with Albacore Carpaccio. What a stunning dish! The presentation was gorgeous and the taste was fantastic. The jalapeño was not too hot, the ponzu sauce complimented the fish so well. And I don't know what was served on top... something that looked fried... very small slivers of fried something? I should have asked; it didn't say on the menu. Anyway.. FANTASTIC. Get it!Mark got the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen. He really enjoyed it.I got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with the braised spare rib. It was really quite good. People have commented on the egg and while I agree I'd expect the yellow to be runny, the description on the menu says boiled egg... and it is boiled. So that's the way they serve it. Works for me. I thought the noodles were delicious. The beef was tender. The broth had a wonderful, beef flavor. I thought it was very good.I'd like to try The Spice Jar for dinner because the dinner menu has more options. Plus it might be fun to check out the evening vibe. From the reviews it seems this place is hopping in the evening. For Saturday lunch... it was super slow. Go visit them... they deserve the business.
My girlfriend and I had seen photos of this place in Instagram and were intrigued to try it out. With two kiddos in tow we hoped for a quick but delicious lunch.They were extremely kid friendly. Although limited with space and rather packed for lunch, they accommodated us and allowed us space for a stroller. Service was very prompt.We shared the nori French fries (3/5) and each got a noodle dish- the laksa (3/5) and tonkatsu Shoyu ramen (2/5)The French fries were decent. Freshly fried but lacked garlic flavor.The laksa was creamy and seafood portions were sufficient. The tonkatsu ramen was flavorful and rich. The braised spare rib was a bit tough to eat and a bit chewy. The soft boiled egg was NOT a soft boiled egg. It was a boiled egg. Decent spot for a bite. Not sure if it was good enough for me to go back.
The Spice Jar was an accidental discovery trying to find dinner in San Francisco, and accidents don't have to be a bad thing.Tagged as "Asian Comfort Food," you would ordinarily expect the most kitsch-y thing ever, something like a cross of P.F. Chang's and Roscoe's. The Spice Jar is not that at all. Rather, it's more of a nice family owned restaurant, and it has a really nice vibe. It's both trendy yet somehow rather comforting.Most of the items on the menu are pretty solid - I will note that beef anything is really good. I will note that with all trendy restaurants, portion sizes leave a bit to be desired. You won't be stuffed here, that's for sure, but you could be amply full if you choose the right items.Probably the most interesting thing here is the 1L Asahi (actually something like 0.946 liters). That thing is massive and is good to share or even have alone.What I found really nice about the restaurant is the size of the kitchen and the service. You see their vast menu, you see their tiny kitchen, you see the workers running around everywhere, and you really feel the effort and care in what they're doing. It's amazing what they can accomplish with a kitchen that small.I'd definitely come here again.TIP: Get the Asahi.
I'm not one for Asian food in hipster areas but this place was surprisingly good!Located in an up and coming area on the less busy Bryant Street in the Mission District is this cute and intimate spot. It's a bit cramped in here so not the best place for a big group. Can look like it's filling up quickly but the turnaround seems fast. Also a lot of take-out orders too so the kitchen is a bit slow.. a good 6 workers or so for this restaurant which can only fit probably like 25-30 people.... but the wait for your food will be worth it, I promise.The workers are all extremely friendly but service may be a bit absent as they ARE busy - responsive when called though.Me and my friend tried quite a few items between the two of us and the only dish I would NOT recommend is the calamari salad.Spare rib bao - as many have stated, it comes as just one meaty rib still on the bone. I was scared it was going to be a bit messy but it was literally fall off the bone tender. Definitely one of the most tender ribs I've had. It was flavored thoroughly! The pickled cucumbers were thickly and roughly chopped, I wish it was cut more thinly, slightly more acidic, and less sweet. Still a very good appetizer - I just wish it came with 2 ribs :(Chicken kara age (not on the online menu) - YASSSSSSS. Crispy (and stayed crispy) and perfectly seasoned. Lightly battered and came with 8-10 decent sized pieces. Would be perfect with beer.Crispy calamari salad - judging from how crispy and delicious the chicken was, I thought it would be the same for the calamari.. The calamari was soggy and didn't taste seasoned :/ The calamari ratio was about 3:1 with the greens, which would normally be a good thing, but it just wasn't GOOD. The red curry honey dressing was pretty nonexistent - kind of like a really watery honey with some spice - I don't think it complimented the salad.Zen noodle soup - I don't usually like noodle soups with seafood because I don't like sea-foody tasting broths - but this was delicious! Very light tasting broth, delicate coconut flavor and just very, very slightly sour and hot. So good! I could eat a million bowls of these. Came with a good portion of shrimp, mussels and calamari. I wish it came with more noodles!Overall, very solid Asian fusion place. Would love to return to try their ramens and would DEFINITELY get the bao and kara age again :)
Some of the best ramen I've had in a long long time! We absolutely loved this place. Came here on a Saturday night at 6:45pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes. By the time we left there was quite a line. It's a small little place with excellent service and fanatic ramen. I ordered the mint tea which was light and refreshing. My husband ordered the spicy sesame miso ramen which was very simple - just broth and ramen noodles. The broth was great with the right amount of spiciness and the noodles were oh so good and extremely fresh. I had the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Again the broth was fantastic and I loved how it wasn't super oily like other places. The service was great. They were very nice and quick with everything. The cost was great as well. Overall this place has everything - great food, great service all at a great cost.
Yummy! Came here on a Sunday and the wait was not too bad. For our party of 4, we waited about 15 min. The location is very tiny so think ahead if you are planning on coming with a big party. The decor was very nice and cute. The staff was great. They were very attentive and friendly.My party and I ordered a bunch of small bites and couple main dishes and everything was tasty! I especially liked the garlic fried rice and Mongolian lamb. Overall I will definitely recommend!
3.5 STARS for a cute and above average Asian Fusion (I think?) spot owned by super friendly Asian folks. I came for brunch, and they have several small shareable plates and entrees, and a very extensive drink list.* SHU MAI - 3.5 stars:Homemade and meaty, but the wrappers were soggy and oversteamed. I liked that they tasted healthy and was well seasoned, but I have to admit I prefer the type at dingy dim sum restaurants because they have more flavor (I know they are chock full of MSG and preservatives....)* TONKATSU RAMEN - 3.5 stars:Decent broth and noodles, AHH-mazingly tender pork rib. Not the best ramen but a really good option for SF standards! * SEAWEED SALAD - 3.5 stars:Enormous portion of spring greens topped with seaweed salad and a soy-apply dressing. A little salty for my liking - ask for dressing on the side.

Given my Chinese background, I am probably harsher on the dishes like the Mongolian beef that has a bit too much sauce.
3.5Very cute asian restaurant at the corner of 23rd and Bryant. When we arrived for lunch on a Fri afternoon, the restaurant (albeit very limited seating and space) was completely packed. We opted to sit outside and brave the wind. Unfortunately, they do not serve hot sake but have plenty of cold sake to choose from. Started with a mint tea, shumai and garlic green beans. Tea and green beans were delicious! Shumai was a bit flavorless and I had to drench mine in a bit of soy sauce.Next came the entree - TONKOTSU-SHOYU RAMEN!!Ramen and broth were delicious!! The egg was average. The pork sparerib was a huge portion and very tender, but not too much flavor. Service was very good and prompt (except for forgetting to bring us some chili paste for the ramen when we first asked). Would love to come back and try some other dishes. I was pretty thirsty after the meal which usually indicates a lot of sodium and/or MSG in the meal :(Love that they store utensils and napkins at the table in empty tins of Cafe Du Monde coffee!!
We came on a weeknight and it was packed.  The restaurant was small, and I recall seeing 2 large tables with small parties sitting together, and a few smaller tables for parties of 2.  We didn't want to wait so we ordered our items to go and we may have waited for 20 minutes for our food.  The restaurant was small and cute.  There were lots of bigger parties, but it seemed like it would make a good, loud, date spot.  Yelp says it was kid friendly, but I wouldn't want to squeeze my toddler in there.  At the same time, I did see another toddler inside with a high chair so it does seem like they can accomodate smaller children.We ordered ramen, pork buns, and fried rice.  The ramen was neatly placed in the to go boxes with soup separated.  The pork buns looked a bit of a disaster in our to go box.  Our buns were soggy from the sauce and meat, the box seemed oversized which caused the food to juggle.  Perhaps, it's not meant for it to be taken out.  I don't have any complaints about my fried rice, but it wasn't special and it wasn't spicy as I thought it would be.They were quick to assist me with the pick up order even though they were extremely busy.  When I placed the order, the server had to step out to escape the noise.  This place may be a bit too trendy for me to visit, and too messy for me to take out.
YUM!We came for lunch today (Saturday). We were there early, so we were the first customers when they opened. We were the only customers while we were there.The woman who helped us was so very kind. We started with plum wine and what?!?! Jalapeño Plum Wine? Yep! I didn't get it, but Mark did. I took a sip. It was good! Oh... my plum wine was SUPER sweet. Plum wine is supposed to be sweet, but this was almost shockingly sweet. I did enjoy it, but asked for a Chardonnay as a follow up.We started with Albacore Carpaccio. What a stunning dish! The presentation was gorgeous and the taste was fantastic. The jalapeño was not too hot, the ponzu sauce complimented the fish so well. And I don't know what was served on top... something that looked fried... very small slivers of fried something? I should have asked; it didn't say on the menu. Anyway.. FANTASTIC. Get it!Mark got the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen. He really enjoyed it.I got the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with the braised spare rib. It was really quite good. People have commented on the egg and while I agree I'd expect the yellow to be runny, the description on the menu says boiled egg... and it is boiled. So that's the way they serve it. Works for me. I thought the noodles were delicious. The beef was tender. The broth had a wonderful, beef flavor. I thought it was very good.I'd like to try The Spice Jar for dinner because the dinner menu has more options. Plus it might be fun to check out the evening vibe. From the reviews it seems this place is hopping in the evening. For Saturday lunch... it was super slow. Go visit them... they deserve the business.
My girlfriend and I had seen photos of this place in Instagram and were intrigued to try it out. With two kiddos in tow we hoped for a quick but delicious lunch.They were extremely kid friendly. Although limited with space and rather packed for lunch, they accommodated us and allowed us space for a stroller. Service was very prompt.We shared the nori French fries (3/5) and each got a noodle dish- the laksa (3/5) and tonkatsu Shoyu ramen (2/5)The French fries were decent. Freshly fried but lacked garlic flavor.The laksa was creamy and seafood portions were sufficient. The tonkatsu ramen was flavorful and rich. The braised spare rib was a bit tough to eat and a bit chewy. The soft boiled egg was NOT a soft boiled egg. It was a boiled egg. Decent spot for a bite. Not sure if it was good enough for me to go back.
The Spice Jar was an accidental discovery trying to find dinner in San Francisco, and accidents don't have to be a bad thing.Tagged as "Asian Comfort Food," you would ordinarily expect the most kitsch-y thing ever, something like a cross of P.F. Chang's and Roscoe's. The Spice Jar is not that at all. Rather, it's more of a nice family owned restaurant, and it has a really nice vibe. It's both trendy yet somehow rather comforting.Most of the items on the menu are pretty solid - I will note that beef anything is really good. I will note that with all trendy restaurants, portion sizes leave a bit to be desired. You won't be stuffed here, that's for sure, but you could be amply full if you choose the right items.Probably the most interesting thing here is the 1L Asahi (actually something like 0.946 liters). That thing is massive and is good to share or even have alone.What I found really nice about the restaurant is the size of the kitchen and the service. You see their vast menu, you see their tiny kitchen, you see the workers running around everywhere, and you really feel the effort and care in what they're doing. It's amazing what they can accomplish with a kitchen that small.I'd definitely come here again.TIP: Get the Asahi.
I'm not one for Asian food in hipster areas but this place was surprisingly good!Located in an up and coming area on the less busy Bryant Street in the Mission District is this cute and intimate spot. It's a bit cramped in here so not the best place for a big group. Can look like it's filling up quickly but the turnaround seems fast. Also a lot of take-out orders too so the kitchen is a bit slow.. a good 6 workers or so for this restaurant which can only fit probably like 25-30 people.... but the wait for your food will be worth it, I promise.The workers are all extremely friendly but service may be a bit absent as they ARE busy - responsive when called though.Me and my friend tried quite a few items between the two of us and the only dish I would NOT recommend is the calamari salad.Spare rib bao - as many have stated, it comes as just one meaty rib still on the bone. I was scared it was going to be a bit messy but it was literally fall off the bone tender. Definitely one of the most tender ribs I've had. It was flavored thoroughly! The pickled cucumbers were thickly and roughly chopped, I wish it was cut more thinly, slightly more acidic, and less sweet. Still a very good appetizer - I just wish it came with 2 ribs :(Chicken kara age (not on the online menu) - YASSSSSSS. Crispy (and stayed crispy) and perfectly seasoned. Lightly battered and came with 8-10 decent sized pieces. Would be perfect with beer.Crispy calamari salad - judging from how crispy and delicious the chicken was, I thought it would be the same for the calamari.. The calamari was soggy and didn't taste seasoned :/ The calamari ratio was about 3:1 with the greens, which would normally be a good thing, but it just wasn't GOOD. The red curry honey dressing was pretty nonexistent - kind of like a really watery honey with some spice - I don't think it complimented the salad.Zen noodle soup - I don't usually like noodle soups with seafood because I don't like sea-foody tasting broths - but this was delicious! Very light tasting broth, delicate coconut flavor and just very, very slightly sour and hot. So good! I could eat a million bowls of these. Came with a good portion of shrimp, mussels and calamari. I wish it came with more noodles!Overall, very solid Asian fusion place. Would love to return to try their ramens and would DEFINITELY get the bao and kara age again :)
Some of the best ramen I've had in a long long time! We absolutely loved this place. Came here on a Saturday night at 6:45pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes. By the time we left there was quite a line. It's a small little place with excellent service and fanatic ramen. I ordered the mint tea which was light and refreshing. My husband ordered the spicy sesame miso ramen which was very simple - just broth and ramen noodles. The broth was great with the right amount of spiciness and the noodles were oh so good and extremely fresh. I had the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Again the broth was fantastic and I loved how it wasn't super oily like other places. The service was great. They were very nice and quick with everything. The cost was great as well. Overall this place has everything - great food, great service all at a great cost.
Yummy! Came here on a Sunday and the wait was not too bad. For our party of 4, we waited about 15 min. The location is very tiny so think ahead if you are planning on coming with a big party. The decor was very nice and cute. The staff was great. They were very attentive and friendly.My party and I ordered a bunch of small bites and couple main dishes and everything was tasty! I especially liked the garlic fried rice and Mongolian lamb. Overall I will definitely recommend!
3.5 STARS for a cute and above average Asian Fusion (I think?) spot owned by super friendly Asian folks. I came for brunch, and they have several small shareable plates and entrees, and a very extensive drink list.* SHU MAI - 3.5 stars:Homemade and meaty, but the wrappers were soggy and oversteamed. I liked that they tasted healthy and was well seasoned, but I have to admit I prefer the type at dingy dim sum restaurants because they have more flavor (I know they are chock full of MSG and preservatives....)* TONKATSU RAMEN - 3.5 stars:Decent broth and noodles, AHH-mazingly tender pork rib. Not the best ramen but a really good option for SF standards! * SEAWEED SALAD - 3.5 stars:Enormous portion of spring greens topped with seaweed salad and a soy-apply dressing. A little salty for my liking - ask for dressing on the side.
This weekend, we ventured out to another unfamiliar neighborhood to try out some new food. Through yelp, we found "The Spice Jar." Normally, I try to stay away from places that have too many cuisines going on at the same time. This restaurant serves Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Italian(?). However, this place has raving reviews and yelpers suggested to try everything on the menu. Sure enough, this restaurant lives up to all the great reviews. The food didn't disappoint, especially the Albacore carpaccio and tonkatsu ramen. In fact, I think this is one of the best ramen I've had in the city. The chef came and asked us about the food. I later found out the chef is the owner of the restaurant. He traveled all over Asia and picked out the best represented dish from each country.  What amazing talent to replicate the different cuisines and make it his own.We all had a great experience here. Great food, friendly service, and cozy atmosphere. We'd definitely come back to try out their other dishes.
Came here for lunch with some friends. The lunch menu is a tad different than the dinner one. Food: I got the Mongolian Beef with bread. Very tasty and flavorful. Not as big as I thought (I'm a big eater) but it was filling enough. Wife got the Tonkasu Ramen. Freaking Bomb! Broth was perfect and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Also got the pork dumplings. These were so so. Garlic fries were also good. Service: on point.  Small trendy little place in a neighborhood. Friendly staff. Will definitely come back to try the dinner menu. Prices are reasonable.
Cute little pan-Asian restaurant on the corner of 23rd and Bryant that is a perfect place for a reasonably priced lunch. The place is little that can get pretty packed. Seating may also be communal.The Zen Noodle soup was delicious. It was a coconut/samal based broth with an assortment of seafood that was sweet and tangy. The tonkatsu ramen was also amazing with the meat falling right off the bone. Definitely a must try!
The Mongolian Beef is what you'd expect and tasty, but I think overpriced compared to what you could get at other asian restaurants. The Spicy Sesame Ramen was decent. My favorite was the Crispy Calamari Salad, but I don't know if I loved it enough to go back just for that item. I'd maybe return when I have more money to spare! :P
The Spice Jar is a relatively new Asian spot in the Mission, bringing homey comfort food from all different Asian cuisines. I wouldn't exactly call it fusion because they somehow bring in distinct flavors from each culture in an authentic way. My boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday, and ended up waiting almost half an hour for a table, which goes to show just how popular it is. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps, a simple dish but full of flavor. I loved the addition of the mushroom with the minced chicken, helping to cut the natural saltiness of the dish. We also tried the har gao, which was definitely on the doughier side but great in terms of portion size. For entrees, we had the tonkatsu ramen and the Spice Jar fried rice. The flavor of the ramen broth was amazing as it tasted like the pork had been stewing for hours. The fried rice was generous in shrimp and chicken portions, but definitely a little too salty for me. Overall, it tasted as close to home-cooked as you can get from a restaurant in the city!
Some people say, "variety is the spice of life". To me, that just means quantity over quality--like buffets. They usually suck and give you bubble guts.Then, you have Pan Asian restaurants that serve popular dishes from various Asian countries. Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. After seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. We ordered the following:*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): bit.ly/1NaltR6*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): bit.ly/1LUlGaS*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, sautéed veggies ($18): bit.ly/1NNmzCD*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): bit.ly/1KI2tb0Based on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. The Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. The Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. The Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. The Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.Service was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. The Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. Parking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.The Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.
I'm usually quite wary of Asian "fusion" restaurants, as it seems to cater towards a crowd unused to specific cuisines. The interior design is very cosy, country home; while adorable, it almost reinforced my expectation of an underwhelming experience, due to cognitive dissonance. That being said, The Spice Jar pleasantly surprised me. I sampled an assortment of dishes and enjoyed all of them.I started with the Crispy Calamari Salad--a generous portion of fresh greens, topped with delicious, lightly breaded calamari and red honey curry dressing. The little critters were crisped perfectly and didn't overpower or wilt the salad leaves.I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen next, and also loved it. I'm used to eating delicious ramen at food trucks, but this was truly a treat. The rib was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the broth was flavorful and substantial without being too salty. The noodles were cooked just right, with a bit of bite to them. The hard boiled egg was done just right too. The couple who owns the restaurant are truly charming and wonderful. I've eaten here a few different times, and in recognizing me, they brought some Aonori Garlic Fries on the house. Yum! I was happy to see, upon my more recent visit, that they'd hired some wait staff. I can't imagine how insane opening weeks must have been with just the two of them doing all of the work--from cooking, to waiting on tables, busing, etc. The interior design is worth mentioning again, because it is so unexpectedly adorable. The bottom of tables are adorned with material that feels like mattress topper--it prevents you from bruising yourself while shifting your legs. I almost want all the restaurants I go to to adopt this methodology. I'm so clumsy, it definitely saved me on multiple occasions.Definitely eat here.
We had a fantastic meal here on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9PM and still waited about 20 minutes to get a table. Parking nearby was really tough to find. The ambiance on the inside is really small, warm, and cozy! The service was also very friendly. The food was fantastic and everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal. I had the red curry which was so decadent and I'd recommend if you're in the mood for Thai Curry. We will definitely be back! Only wish they took reservations, I hate waiting!
My husband ate at this establishment on Saturday night with his buddy. The next morning he had food poisoning. Please stay away from their salmon dish.Usually I like to give new hip places a chance, but after seeing my husband suffering the last couple of days, no thank you.
Found this spot by just walking around the neighborhood. The design/style caught my eye, especially the beautiful art/lighting piece in the center of the room. The menu has so many things that all sounded appealing. We went for a few things and split them. Portions are BIG! The Garlic Edamame was delicious but would only order if you want to share them between 3/4 people because it's a lot of edamame. The Tonkatsu Ramen tasted really fresh. Love the rib that comes in it. The meat practically falls off the bone and adds to the broth.The Mongolian Beef was tasty and nice to try it with bread - although I would have preferred it with rice. It's a great find though. Go before a line of Mission Techies find it.
