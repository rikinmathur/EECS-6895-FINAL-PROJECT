Hello Vitamin D!  I've missed you so much!  FiDi gave me shadows, chills and stinky pee pee.  And so, when I found this park near my new work location, I did a little happy dance!En-caved around historical warehouse brick buildings lies a land of lush greens, tranquility and peacefulness.  It's welcoming every day of the week!  It's such a nice retreat to have on days your brain is fried from staring long hours at a messed up data set that you've been analyzing all week that just doesn't make sense!  What makes sense are the neat landscaping of nature to calm the soul and rejuvenate what little brain power you have left.  Now that I get to enjoy this park 5-days out of the week, I wish I lived close-by, like Gateway Apartments.  But do I dare know what the prices are?  Not affordable.  For now, I'll enjoy this secret garden to myself (and all the other people that works here). But I'm glad to have access to this park near by.  NOTES: no free parking.  it's all metered or paid parking lots.
Little outdoor spaces like this make me want to work in a large city like S.F. Well maintained park with seating.A little oasis in a busy city.
A beautiful, well cared for place. Perfect for laying in the sun, eating lunch. However breathing fresh air is problematic as this place is the smokers lounge for all the offices. Just as you get comfortable and open up your sandwich, somebody will sit next to you and light up.
If I left my heart in San Francisco, this little gem of a park would be the place. Is your sad little heart broken? Yeah, haul it over here. Is your pale-ass heart needin' some sun? Bring it and a blanket. Crazy little kid hearts need a minute to run? Done!  (Then please get out so it doesn't get too crazy.)* tucked away just enough that it's not crowded* a little water falling * a little bird preening* a little branch swinging* views of, one of my faves, the Transamerica Tower * nice green open space in the sun* flat stones for sitting in the shade* yes, named for Levi Strauss HQ All-around, a nice little spot to catch your breath, have a snack, tap a nap. I was the only one here save for a couple of sunbathers on my first visit. The weekend finds me enjoying the presence of what I'd guess were two locals having an intimate chat on a bench. One family with young kids arrives for a few minutes to run in the grass as another family leaves. Butterflies flicker in the bushes and dragonflies dip in the water. I sit under the tree. I'm not a local but I'm not in tourist mode. It's probably not on any tourist's "must see" list, so I really like it and you can feel that the energy here is more serene and calming. Sometimes, a heart needs just that.Oh!! And a happy dog heart busts over a verdant knoll. You knoll it. Even doggies leave their hearts here.
I can do without the corporate branding and the ads on what looks like a neighborhood-information kiosk, but the park is too much of a gem to be dinging for pre-afterthoughts.It's beautiful and well maintained and inviting and hidden and welcoming and meandering and shady and sunny and inspiring and quieting.  I'm really glad the tourists haven't taken it over, and I'd like to see what it's like during lunch hour on a weekday.  There are views in all directions, but the one of Coit Tower is perfect.There is still so much of our city to love.  I guess that's why I hate it so much these days.  Too many people with too much money are finally picking up on what all of us working-class folks have known for a long time:  San Francisco is a beautiful place.  Unfortunately, the place will be all that's left of San Francisco very soon unless someone does something about the housing situation.  We don't need more housing or more below-market-rate housing; we need AFFORDABLE HOUSING.  We also need to stop doing rich people favors.  See, here's the funny thing about the rich:  They only return the favors of other rich people.
I feel super lucky to have this Park right by my work. It's such a lovely, peaceful place to eat lunch. The grass is always green, the fountains mask the city noise, everything is always clean, security strolls around regularly, and there are plenty of places to sit: benches, huge stones, grass. It's a make your own adventure lunch spot with plenty of sun (when the fog lets it through..) and shade. Pro tip - Wednesdays in September and the first half of October have a live music program run by SFJazz that is great!
Very lovely green and flowery area! Great views of downtown as the backdrop.  I enjoy walking my dog through this park and resting on the benches.  A word to the wise:  keep your dog on a leash.  I learned this the hard way when I thought it would be fun to play fetch with him on one of the grassy knolls.  A security guard came out of nowhere and politely told me that dogs must be on leashes.  Fair enough.
Levi's Plaza Park is right next to my work and I try to come out and relax here whenever I have the chance to. I love how clean this park is and how many different patches of grass there are to sit and sleep on. Great place to have lunch or just hang out. Dolores Park is one of the most disgusting parks in the city due to how crowded it is on a regular basis and Levi's Plaza Park is the exact opposite of that.
There are quite a few reviews of this park so I'll just add a few things. My kids didn't want to leave this park even though we were going to the Exploratorium. Parking is free on Sunday at the meters on Battery Street right at the park. There were plenty of spaces up and down the street. Don't waste $10-20 on parking at the recommended Exploratorium garages and lots. Let the kids play at the park before or after running around the piers and Exploratorium. We could even see a cruise ship in the bay right across the street from the park. The only downside is Embarcadero is busy all the time so keep an eye on the kids. And bring a change of clothes for the kids; they love to get wet in the little streams crossing this park!
This was a great little stop suggested by my daughter.  My trick to making it through a full day in the city w/ kids is to stop, rest, and let them loose for a bit before resuming our journey.  I do that every 2 hours just so they don't get exhausted, even the one in the stroller.  I also used this stop to feed him lunch and to enjoy the scenery, not just "rest" because being a single parent means being on duty 24/7.  Though a very small park but it's super clean and the waters made it very serene.  I love that you can't really see this local gem from the street especially if you are driving.  If you are walking and too oblivious to your surroundings then you too will surely bypass this.  A great little picnic spot by yourself, w/ the kids, or w/ a special someone!
It's a pretty park....But they kicked us all out today!! Granted, "us" consisted of a couple hundred people not wearing pants due to the annual SF No Pants Subway Ride event....but still! I'm cross. Heheh.Security guard: "What are you guys protesting, anyway?"Me: "Pants."
Like a favorite pair of blue jeans, our visit to Levi's Plaza and the Levi Strauss & Company world headquarters was comfortable and relaxed.  With some aged cheese and a loaf of sourdough, we crossed the Embarcadero from Pier 23 to have a picnic, admire the landscape architecture, and browse through the headquarters building, mini museum, and company store.We were drawn into Levi's Plaza Park by the rolling green grass hills and meandering mountain streams, representative of the company's origins outfitting the Sierra Nevada gold rush miners.  The plaza was created by the celebrated modernist landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, who is famous for his alluring designs.  The focal point of the plaza is a geometric, multi-tiered fountain of cascading waters, with stepping stones encircling a 72-ton centerpiece of carnelian granite.Across the plaza, the Levi's logo directed us into the low-profile, red brick corporate headquarters building.  Inside we shopped for Levi's newest products in the company store, observed fashion designers at work in the airy atrium, and perused a mini Levi's history museum.We learned that Levi Strauss came to San Francisco in 1853, and made his fortune selling riveted denim blue jeans, the most popular garment ever worn.  Levi was adored as a faithful employer and munificent philanthropist.  His generous spirit endures in the comfort of his clothes and openness of his corporate headquarters campus.For the relaxed vibe, captivating landscapes, welcoming headquarters building and company store, and interesting mini museum and atrium, I give Levi's Plaza and Levi Strauss & Company world headquarters four stars, riveted to the pockets of your favorite blue jeans.
Neat little public square.  I'm a fan anytime I see grass in the city.  Go here if you need a quick break and enjoy the coit tower in the background.
Excellent piazza w easy access to Coit Tower steps and the Embarcadero.A favorite stop during a walk or run in the City.
Love this plaza. It's right under my favorite running spot, and it's right next to the Ferry Building. Sure parking is a hassle, but they just built a bunch of stuff by the area. Plus, there are so many benches here to just sit on and watch the day fly by. Really like this park.
What a chill spot to read or hang out at. Well thought out design and use of hills to give you a  sense of privacy. Nice kid friendly location. I'll definitely stop back next time I'm over in the embarcadero area. Beautiful.
Great little park, definitely hidden. I was going to the filbert steps when i came upon this place. It is nice and relaxing and has a nice Water sculpture that you can walk around and in between. some nice grass to lay on and tons of space for kids! As someone mentioned, hidden gem!!!
It's a park. It's a park that blue jeans built. Ill-fitting and ugly blue jeans at that. But it is still a park in the middle of the city. I think to do the park appropriately you are supposed to listen to Tiny Dancer on your iPod/iPhone.
This is the cutest little park, so beautiful. It's a hidden gem. Very clean and peaceful. Great place to have a picnic, walk your dog, hang out with your family, or go on a date :)
I accidentally found this park while strolling north through San Francisco. I hadn't realised that Levi's had started here in the city.It was nice to have this little haven and shade for a little rest. The water features are a nice touch.Perfect place for a short pick me up on the way to the touristy parts on the northern peninsula

Sometimes, a heart needs just that.Oh!! And a happy dog heart busts over a verdant knoll. You knoll it. Even doggies leave their hearts here.
I can do without the corporate branding and the ads on what looks like a neighborhood-information kiosk, but the park is too much of a gem to be dinging for pre-afterthoughts.It's beautiful and well maintained and inviting and hidden and welcoming and meandering and shady and sunny and inspiring and quieting.  I'm really glad the tourists haven't taken it over, and I'd like to see what it's like during lunch hour on a weekday.  There are views in all directions, but the one of Coit Tower is perfect.There is still so much of our city to love.  I guess that's why I hate it so much these days.  Too many people with too much money are finally picking up on what all of us working-class folks have known for a long time:  San Francisco is a beautiful place.  Unfortunately, the place will be all that's left of San Francisco very soon unless someone does something about the housing situation.  We don't need more housing or more below-market-rate housing; we need AFFORDABLE HOUSING.  We also need to stop doing rich people favors.  See, here's the funny thing about the rich:  They only return the favors of other rich people.
I feel super lucky to have this Park right by my work. It's such a lovely, peaceful place to eat lunch. The grass is always green, the fountains mask the city noise, everything is always clean, security strolls around regularly, and there are plenty of places to sit: benches, huge stones, grass. It's a make your own adventure lunch spot with plenty of sun (when the fog lets it through..) and shade. Pro tip - Wednesdays in September and the first half of October have a live music program run by SFJazz that is great!
Very lovely green and flowery area! Great views of downtown as the backdrop.  I enjoy walking my dog through this park and resting on the benches.  A word to the wise:  keep your dog on a leash.  I learned this the hard way when I thought it would be fun to play fetch with him on one of the grassy knolls.  A security guard came out of nowhere and politely told me that dogs must be on leashes.  Fair enough.
Levi's Plaza Park is right next to my work and I try to come out and relax here whenever I have the chance to. I love how clean this park is and how many different patches of grass there are to sit and sleep on. Great place to have lunch or just hang out. Dolores Park is one of the most disgusting parks in the city due to how crowded it is on a regular basis and Levi's Plaza Park is the exact opposite of that.
There are quite a few reviews of this park so I'll just add a few things. My kids didn't want to leave this park even though we were going to the Exploratorium. Parking is free on Sunday at the meters on Battery Street right at the park. There were plenty of spaces up and down the street. Don't waste $10-20 on parking at the recommended Exploratorium garages and lots. Let the kids play at the park before or after running around the piers and Exploratorium. We could even see a cruise ship in the bay right across the street from the park. The only downside is Embarcadero is busy all the time so keep an eye on the kids. And bring a change of clothes for the kids; they love to get wet in the little streams crossing this park!
This was a great little stop suggested by my daughter.  My trick to making it through a full day in the city w/ kids is to stop, rest, and let them loose for a bit before resuming our journey.  I do that every 2 hours just so they don't get exhausted, even the one in the stroller.  I also used this stop to feed him lunch and to enjoy the scenery, not just "rest" because being a single parent means being on duty 24/7.  Though a very small park but it's super clean and the waters made it very serene.  I love that you can't really see this local gem from the street especially if you are driving.  If you are walking and too oblivious to your surroundings then you too will surely bypass this.  A great little picnic spot by yourself, w/ the kids, or w/ a special someone!
It's a pretty park....But they kicked us all out today!! Granted, "us" consisted of a couple hundred people not wearing pants due to the annual SF No Pants Subway Ride event....but still! I'm cross. Heheh.Security guard: "What are you guys protesting, anyway?"Me: "Pants."
Like a favorite pair of blue jeans, our visit to Levi's Plaza and the Levi Strauss & Company world headquarters was comfortable and relaxed.  With some aged cheese and a loaf of sourdough, we crossed the Embarcadero from Pier 23 to have a picnic, admire the landscape architecture, and browse through the headquarters building, mini museum, and company store.We were drawn into Levi's Plaza Park by the rolling green grass hills and meandering mountain streams, representative of the company's origins outfitting the Sierra Nevada gold rush miners.  The plaza was created by the celebrated modernist landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, who is famous for his alluring designs.  The focal point of the plaza is a geometric, multi-tiered fountain of cascading waters, with stepping stones encircling a 72-ton centerpiece of carnelian granite.Across the plaza, the Levi's logo directed us into the low-profile, red brick corporate headquarters building.  Inside we shopped for Levi's newest products in the company store, observed fashion designers at work in the airy atrium, and perused a mini Levi's history museum.We learned that Levi Strauss came to San Francisco in 1853, and made his fortune selling riveted denim blue jeans, the most popular garment ever worn.  Levi was adored as a faithful employer and munificent philanthropist.  His generous spirit endures in the comfort of his clothes and openness of his corporate headquarters campus.For the relaxed vibe, captivating landscapes, welcoming headquarters building and company store, and interesting mini museum and atrium, I give Levi's Plaza and Levi Strauss & Company world headquarters four stars, riveted to the pockets of your favorite blue jeans.
Neat little public square.  I'm a fan anytime I see grass in the city.  Go here if you need a quick break and enjoy the coit tower in the background.
Excellent piazza w easy access to Coit Tower steps and the Embarcadero.A favorite stop during a walk or run in the City.
Love this plaza. It's right under my favorite running spot, and it's right next to the Ferry Building. Sure parking is a hassle, but they just built a bunch of stuff by the area. Plus, there are so many benches here to just sit on and watch the day fly by. Really like this park.
What a chill spot to read or hang out at. Well thought out design and use of hills to give you a  sense of privacy. Nice kid friendly location. I'll definitely stop back next time I'm over in the embarcadero area. Beautiful.
Great little park, definitely hidden. I was going to the filbert steps when i came upon this place. It is nice and relaxing and has a nice Water sculpture that you can walk around and in between. some nice grass to lay on and tons of space for kids! As someone mentioned, hidden gem!!!
It's a park. It's a park that blue jeans built. Ill-fitting and ugly blue jeans at that. But it is still a park in the middle of the city. I think to do the park appropriately you are supposed to listen to Tiny Dancer on your iPod/iPhone.
This is the cutest little park, so beautiful. It's a hidden gem. Very clean and peaceful. Great place to have a picnic, walk your dog, hang out with your family, or go on a date :)
I accidentally found this park while strolling north through San Francisco. I hadn't realised that Levi's had started here in the city.It was nice to have this little haven and shade for a little rest. The water features are a nice touch.Perfect place for a short pick me up on the way to the touristy parts on the northern peninsula
