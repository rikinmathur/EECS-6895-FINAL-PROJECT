You had me at shrimp garlic burrito.Okay, so maybe this filling dinner wasn't ideal before a show at The Independent, but it happened and I regret nothing.The small, dark burrito/taco spot on Divis lived up to all the hype. The menu is filled with clean, colorful options ranging from veg to full carnivore. And if you're crazing an ice cold tecate or marg to wet your whistle, you're in the right spot.Perf spot for a quick dinner with friends or quick burrito pick up to take home and binge like last season of Girls.
I have been on the fence about TLC since I moved to the Lower Haight. I guess I was turned off by the prices, portion sizes and the fact that its always crowded even with 5 people in line to order/waiting for food which I think gets to me the most.When I do go, I get the super burrito which is pretty good but not "super" whatsoever. This would be a kids burrito at any other Mexican place. On the flip side, their ingredients are solid so I don't feel like curling up in a ball and hiding from the world after I eat it. But for $11+ I would expect more food.All in all, this place is growing on me.. especially since I found out I could call in my order!
I was only ok on the spicy shrimp burrito. It was surprisingly spicy, so be warned if you're wimpy when it comes to heat. Also, if you're looking for a fattt burrito, this isn't it. Don't get me wrong, it's still plenty filling, but I know people sometimes scoff at burritos that aren't the size a newborn baby. The salsa bar is great. Very fresh an flavorful choices. You have to pay for chips (boo)I definitely want to go back to try something else. I think I got confused by the menu or panicked or something because I didn't realize they had regular burritos too (steak, chicken, etc) that you could customize the type of fillings and got distracted by the pre-determined burrito menu items (i.g. shrimp burrito)It gets a crowded fo sho.
In a search for San Francisco's best salad?  Meet The Little Chihuahua.  Let's be clear:  I'm not suggesting that The Little Chihuahua has authentic Mexican cuisine nor am I asserting that their offerings are "the best of" across the board.  I wouldn't know, having had only one item.But when you leave a place imagining how soon you can come back for the same thing you just ate that counts for something.  As you drive home across the bridge thinking how you can't wait to come back here with your friend, that counts for something else.  When I ordered The Little Chihuahua's Tostada Salad ($10.95; with carne asada $1.50 extra) the friendly guy at the counter asked "have you had our salads before?"  then told me that I was "in for a treat; they're really good".  That man speaks the truth.  I ate at the Noe Valley outpost of TLC 5 years ago and - because I assume my yelp review was accurate - ordered the exact same thing as I did on my visit to this location.  Even though I thought this menu offering was quite good in 2011  it's clear that some things do improve with age.  TLC has had 5 years to achieve perfection and, with their Tostada Salad, they've done so.   The Divisadero location isn't much to look at so it came as a complete surprise to find something so satisfying inside.  Looks don't count for everything though and when you see, then taste, this salad all other views will dim in comparison.  Looking for a best in class salad?  The search is over.
Tried to go to Nopalito for dinner one Thursday night and realized we didn't feel like waiting (the wait was an hour) so we strolled a bit and found TLC. I had never been here before and was a bit skeptical but was actually very happy and satisfied with my meal. I ordered the Carne Asada Plate, chips and guac and a glass of cab. LOVED the carne asada plate - was able to make my own tacos!Definitely ordering the burrito next time, it looked amazing!
I really wanted to like this place way more than I actually did. After picking my copy of Rupi Kaur's Milk & Honey from The Booksmith, we were hungry and looking for a Mexican restaurant in the area that would satisfy our cravings. I had The Little Chihuahua bookmarked and had heard great things about it. I had heard that it was not only a little hipster but also healthy, organic, with a focus on offering sustainable and wholesome Mexican food without sacrificing taste. That was something I could get behind!Walking in, the ambiance and concept of the restaurant was lovely! I loved the dimly lit lights and the whole atmosphere of the place. The place can get crowded on weekends and nights, but make sure to order before you take a seat! We ordered the al pastor and garlic shrimp burritos and a large serving ($1) for chips. I loved the salsa here. If anything, come here for chips and salsa!! The salsa flavors are incredibly dimensional and delicious. There's even labels and spicy levels. I really enjoyed the roasted one and the green one. You can really taste the difference in these tortilla chips. They taste healthier, cleaner and less oily, which I loved!!Al pastor burrito: I enjoyed this one more than I expected. The flavor was alright but it wasn't ohmygod amazing like so many other places Mexican places I've been to. The meat was probably the standout part of this dish but it still wasn't spectacular. The flavor didn't strike me as unique or flavorful. To me, it was actually kind of bland. The overall taste of this burrito was just average, nothing that I would ever crave or return for.Garlic shrimp burrito: Okay, I really really wanted to like this one. I love garlic and I love seafood so this was right up my alley. The garlic flavor hits you immediately but that's really all I tasted from it. The burrito overall was quite bland and I felt like I was just chewing a mush of ingredients without any prominent or spectacular taste coming from it. My tastebuds were not impressed. Especially at the price point of $25 for about two burritos, I expected a lot more from this place. As much as I tried to, I couldn't bring myself to really fall in love with either of burritos we got.
Want to get a great meal, cheap price and leave satisfied, well then you have come to the right place.  Upon walking into the front door, you are quickly greeted with a family style, quaint restaurant.  The style here is place your order at the counter, take a number and pick a seat.  Since the place was crowded we did have to sit with some random's.  I ordered the garlic shrimp burrito.  After reading the menu, was craving some beans and rice and thought that I would test this one out. The serving size as very filling, however after I consumed all of the salsa, it lacked some flavor.  I could only consume about 3/4 of it purely because of getting full not due to taste.  They do serve organic chips, a cool idea!  There is a salad bar set up, where you can pick which kind of salas you would like.  They are rated on spiciness as well.  I enjoyed the floor of the salas and chips the most.Throughout the restaurant there are photos of Spanish objects with the word listed below.  If nothing else you will leave the place with a full belly, and having learned a few new Spanish words.
We wanted some "healthier" food, so we came here for some chicken nachos.  So good.  It was PACKED on a Friday night, but we still managed to get a table.  Even though it was crowded, the line moved quickly and food still came out without me getting hangry.  I definitely recommend the nachos, they're on point:  good ratio of toppings, crisp chips, and a side of salsa from the salsa bar.   YUM.
Love this place...food is still amazing.  Vegetarian beans are still here! I always get the mushroom enchiladas with no queso fresco and green sauce. mmm!They have a sauce bar with some yummy sauces.
Delicious burritos!!! My boyfriend's favorite is the garlic shrimp - so amazing. Juicy pieces of shrimp - mouth is watering now - and the garlic flavor is strong so if you're on a date, share it so neither of you have to worry about your breath haha.I did a bit of a custom order with the wild mushrooms and al pastor super baby burrito. It was the size of a regular burrito which was surprising considering it was "baby" but no complaints here! Great flavor and texture - I was super satisfied!!Really personable staff (:
After TLC, I'm convinced LA isn't the only place for a great taco.-Wild Mushroom: Loved this! I nearly forgot I wasn't eating meat from the huge portion and texture of the mushroom medley. A must order for any mushroom lover. -Al Pastor: The meat portion of this is generous. I'm pretty sure I was full after the mushroom taco alone, but I could not get enough of the flavor of this al pastor. The chewiness of their corn tortillas were also a hit with me. Don't forget to stock up on the salsa bar!This place is also pretty walkable from the Haight/Ashbury area.Loved it! Will be back the next time I'm in town.
Amazing Mexican food. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients when you come here. From the delicious chips to the Carne asade, everything has a delicious and fresh taste.My go to is the carne asade nachos. I can eat a whole order when I'm really hungry, but be warned it's a lot of food. You really can't go wrong with anything here. My friend and I get really lucky everytime we come here since there magically happens to be a seat available. I would try to come either earlier or later so you can get a table.
I went earlier today and had the Breakfast Tacos! Loved it! I'm definitely a fan!I also had the taco salad too, which was fairly decent too. Huge portions though! Come hungry.They also have the standard chips and salsa served like other Mexican restaurants.This is definitely a good addition to the Haight neighborhood and a local favorite. Depending on the time, you could find yourself waiting in line for quite some time.
WOW AMAZING, so fresh, so flavorful, so absolutely perfect. This pollo asada taco salad I had was an experience. Where do I begin? The crispy shell it came in for one...there was some kind of cinnamon in that flaky yumminess. The black beans were so home made tasting it made me smile in appreciation. They use spring greens rather than the usual mix of romaine and iceberg you commonly see in taco salads. & it really works sooo well. Now about that salsa or dressing or whatever it is. This is the special sauce that I was loving and attempting to deconstruct. Mild spiciness, mango bits, citrusy zest and just the right amount throughout the salad.TLC does taco salads right. I can't wait to try the other items!!!!
Great neighborhood burrito spot.  My go to for a quick bite.
I feel terrible writing this but who gets guacamole wrong? My husband just came home from this place with one burrito and a side of guacamole with chips a $20 total bill, terribly overpriced, and everything tasted bad. The burrito had whole black beans which to me is always a bad sign, the rice was not tasty and the so called grass fed carne asada, we only found two tiny pieces in the entire burrito that's total deception. The pico de gallo was not fresh, it unfortunately tasted harshly refrigerated, the onions were raw yet soggy which isn't right. We wanted to splurge on a healthier option and feel completely ripped off. I'd love to be proven wrong but unfortunately we are so saddened by how terrible the taste test was and the lack of quality authentic ingredients.
Maybe the burritos are good, but the tostada salad and the quesadilla were lacking.Tostada Salad with Camarones: Oversauced beyond belief. I actually couldn't finish it because it was dripping with sauce. Couldn't taste the ingredients. And there were like only 5 teeeeeny tiny shrimp in my salad. SHRIMP ARE CHEAP! Give me more shrimp. That being said, the tostada shell of the salad was Delicious. Quesadilla with Chicken: Looks beautiful but it was kind of flat. Everything was too soft. You expect a quesadilla to have a more toasted and crustier shell. We went tonight and it was surprisingly packed for 9:50 pm. We waited in line behind 3 groups to order at the counter. At least we had chips to tide us over as we waited for our food; the salsa bar (especially the habenero) is pretty darn delicious.
Ok...it's San Francisco, who doesn't enjoy a burrito. This place has the best Al Pastor burrito. The salsa bar is very fresh and the chips are made in house. Although the chips aren't free, the quality is worth the extra buck. The dining room is small but family friendly and the staff is very efficient. With a few locations, this place is a must try.
Amazingly good food! Vegetarian friendly. We got the regular nachos,  breakfast tacos, friend plantain and beans burrito, veggie burrito with chile tomato tortilla and the grilled veggie tacos for 5 of us. All great!!!
Fajita burrito was a good choice. Splitting it was not. Burritos are not big here. They're not bad for one person, but they're not the Chipotle sized ones I'm used to. Salsa bar was so cool. I love making my own salsa mix. Chips were $1.00 but totally worth it. Great stop for lunch.

After TLC, I'm convinced LA isn't the only place for a great taco.-Wild Mushroom: Loved this! I nearly forgot I wasn't eating meat from the huge portion and texture of the mushroom medley. A must order for any mushroom lover. -Al Pastor: The meat portion of this is generous. I'm pretty sure I was full after the mushroom taco alone, but I could not get enough of the flavor of this al pastor. The chewiness of their corn tortillas were also a hit with me. Don't forget to stock up on the salsa bar!This place is also pretty walkable from the Haight/Ashbury area.Loved it! Will be back the next time I'm in town.
Amazing Mexican food. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients when you come here. From the delicious chips to the Carne asade, everything has a delicious and fresh taste.My go to is the carne asade nachos. I can eat a whole order when I'm really hungry, but be warned it's a lot of food. You really can't go wrong with anything here. My friend and I get really lucky everytime we come here since there magically happens to be a seat available. I would try to come either earlier or later so you can get a table.
I went earlier today and had the Breakfast Tacos! Loved it! I'm definitely a fan!I also had the taco salad too, which was fairly decent too. Huge portions though! Come hungry.They also have the standard chips and salsa served like other Mexican restaurants.This is definitely a good addition to the Haight neighborhood and a local favorite. Depending on the time, you could find yourself waiting in line for quite some time.
WOW AMAZING, so fresh, so flavorful, so absolutely perfect. This pollo asada taco salad I had was an experience. Where do I begin? The crispy shell it came in for one...there was some kind of cinnamon in that flaky yumminess. The black beans were so home made tasting it made me smile in appreciation. They use spring greens rather than the usual mix of romaine and iceberg you commonly see in taco salads. & it really works sooo well. Now about that salsa or dressing or whatever it is. This is the special sauce that I was loving and attempting to deconstruct. Mild spiciness, mango bits, citrusy zest and just the right amount throughout the salad.TLC does taco salads right. I can't wait to try the other items!!!!
Great neighborhood burrito spot.  My go to for a quick bite.
I feel terrible writing this but who gets guacamole wrong? My husband just came home from this place with one burrito and a side of guacamole with chips a $20 total bill, terribly overpriced, and everything tasted bad. The burrito had whole black beans which to me is always a bad sign, the rice was not tasty and the so called grass fed carne asada, we only found two tiny pieces in the entire burrito that's total deception. The pico de gallo was not fresh, it unfortunately tasted harshly refrigerated, the onions were raw yet soggy which isn't right. We wanted to splurge on a healthier option and feel completely ripped off. I'd love to be proven wrong but unfortunately we are so saddened by how terrible the taste test was and the lack of quality authentic ingredients.
Maybe the burritos are good, but the tostada salad and the quesadilla were lacking.Tostada Salad with Camarones: Oversauced beyond belief. I actually couldn't finish it because it was dripping with sauce. Couldn't taste the ingredients. And there were like only 5 teeeeeny tiny shrimp in my salad. SHRIMP ARE CHEAP! Give me more shrimp. That being said, the tostada shell of the salad was Delicious. Quesadilla with Chicken: Looks beautiful but it was kind of flat. Everything was too soft. You expect a quesadilla to have a more toasted and crustier shell. We went tonight and it was surprisingly packed for 9:50 pm. We waited in line behind 3 groups to order at the counter. At least we had chips to tide us over as we waited for our food; the salsa bar (especially the habenero) is pretty darn delicious.
Ok...it's San Francisco, who doesn't enjoy a burrito. This place has the best Al Pastor burrito. The salsa bar is very fresh and the chips are made in house. Although the chips aren't free, the quality is worth the extra buck. The dining room is small but family friendly and the staff is very efficient. With a few locations, this place is a must try.
Amazingly good food! Vegetarian friendly. We got the regular nachos,  breakfast tacos, friend plantain and beans burrito, veggie burrito with chile tomato tortilla and the grilled veggie tacos for 5 of us. All great!!!
Fajita burrito was a good choice. Splitting it was not. Burritos are not big here. They're not bad for one person, but they're not the Chipotle sized ones I'm used to. Salsa bar was so cool. I love making my own salsa mix. Chips were $1.00 but totally worth it. Great stop for lunch.
You had me at shrimp garlic burrito.Okay, so maybe this filling dinner wasn't ideal before a show at The Independent, but it happened and I regret nothing.The small, dark burrito/taco spot on Divis lived up to all the hype. The menu is filled with clean, colorful options ranging from veg to full carnivore. And if you're crazing an ice cold tecate or marg to wet your whistle, you're in the right spot.Perf spot for a quick dinner with friends or quick burrito pick up to take home and binge like last season of Girls.
I have been on the fence about TLC since I moved to the Lower Haight. I guess I was turned off by the prices, portion sizes and the fact that its always crowded even with 5 people in line to order/waiting for food which I think gets to me the most.When I do go, I get the super burrito which is pretty good but not "super" whatsoever. This would be a kids burrito at any other Mexican place. On the flip side, their ingredients are solid so I don't feel like curling up in a ball and hiding from the world after I eat it. But for $11+ I would expect more food.All in all, this place is growing on me.. especially since I found out I could call in my order!
I was only ok on the spicy shrimp burrito. It was surprisingly spicy, so be warned if you're wimpy when it comes to heat. Also, if you're looking for a fattt burrito, this isn't it. Don't get me wrong, it's still plenty filling, but I know people sometimes scoff at burritos that aren't the size a newborn baby. The salsa bar is great. Very fresh an flavorful choices. You have to pay for chips (boo)I definitely want to go back to try something else. I think I got confused by the menu or panicked or something because I didn't realize they had regular burritos too (steak, chicken, etc) that you could customize the type of fillings and got distracted by the pre-determined burrito menu items (i.g. shrimp burrito)It gets a crowded fo sho.
In a search for San Francisco's best salad?  Meet The Little Chihuahua.  Let's be clear:  I'm not suggesting that The Little Chihuahua has authentic Mexican cuisine nor am I asserting that their offerings are "the best of" across the board.  I wouldn't know, having had only one item.But when you leave a place imagining how soon you can come back for the same thing you just ate that counts for something.  As you drive home across the bridge thinking how you can't wait to come back here with your friend, that counts for something else.  When I ordered The Little Chihuahua's Tostada Salad ($10.95; with carne asada $1.50 extra) the friendly guy at the counter asked "have you had our salads before?"  then told me that I was "in for a treat; they're really good".  That man speaks the truth.  I ate at the Noe Valley outpost of TLC 5 years ago and - because I assume my yelp review was accurate - ordered the exact same thing as I did on my visit to this location.  Even though I thought this menu offering was quite good in 2011  it's clear that some things do improve with age.  TLC has had 5 years to achieve perfection and, with their Tostada Salad, they've done so.   The Divisadero location isn't much to look at so it came as a complete surprise to find something so satisfying inside.  Looks don't count for everything though and when you see, then taste, this salad all other views will dim in comparison.  Looking for a best in class salad?  The search is over.
Tried to go to Nopalito for dinner one Thursday night and realized we didn't feel like waiting (the wait was an hour) so we strolled a bit and found TLC. I had never been here before and was a bit skeptical but was actually very happy and satisfied with my meal. I ordered the Carne Asada Plate, chips and guac and a glass of cab. LOVED the carne asada plate - was able to make my own tacos!Definitely ordering the burrito next time, it looked amazing!
I really wanted to like this place way more than I actually did. After picking my copy of Rupi Kaur's Milk & Honey from The Booksmith, we were hungry and looking for a Mexican restaurant in the area that would satisfy our cravings. I had The Little Chihuahua bookmarked and had heard great things about it. I had heard that it was not only a little hipster but also healthy, organic, with a focus on offering sustainable and wholesome Mexican food without sacrificing taste. That was something I could get behind!Walking in, the ambiance and concept of the restaurant was lovely! I loved the dimly lit lights and the whole atmosphere of the place. The place can get crowded on weekends and nights, but make sure to order before you take a seat! We ordered the al pastor and garlic shrimp burritos and a large serving ($1) for chips. I loved the salsa here. If anything, come here for chips and salsa!! The salsa flavors are incredibly dimensional and delicious. There's even labels and spicy levels. I really enjoyed the roasted one and the green one. You can really taste the difference in these tortilla chips. They taste healthier, cleaner and less oily, which I loved!!Al pastor burrito: I enjoyed this one more than I expected. The flavor was alright but it wasn't ohmygod amazing like so many other places Mexican places I've been to. The meat was probably the standout part of this dish but it still wasn't spectacular. The flavor didn't strike me as unique or flavorful. To me, it was actually kind of bland. The overall taste of this burrito was just average, nothing that I would ever crave or return for.Garlic shrimp burrito: Okay, I really really wanted to like this one. I love garlic and I love seafood so this was right up my alley. The garlic flavor hits you immediately but that's really all I tasted from it. The burrito overall was quite bland and I felt like I was just chewing a mush of ingredients without any prominent or spectacular taste coming from it. My tastebuds were not impressed. Especially at the price point of $25 for about two burritos, I expected a lot more from this place. As much as I tried to, I couldn't bring myself to really fall in love with either of burritos we got.
Want to get a great meal, cheap price and leave satisfied, well then you have come to the right place.  Upon walking into the front door, you are quickly greeted with a family style, quaint restaurant.  The style here is place your order at the counter, take a number and pick a seat.  Since the place was crowded we did have to sit with some random's.  I ordered the garlic shrimp burrito.  After reading the menu, was craving some beans and rice and thought that I would test this one out. The serving size as very filling, however after I consumed all of the salsa, it lacked some flavor.  I could only consume about 3/4 of it purely because of getting full not due to taste.  They do serve organic chips, a cool idea!  There is a salad bar set up, where you can pick which kind of salas you would like.  They are rated on spiciness as well.  I enjoyed the floor of the salas and chips the most.Throughout the restaurant there are photos of Spanish objects with the word listed below.  If nothing else you will leave the place with a full belly, and having learned a few new Spanish words.
We wanted some "healthier" food, so we came here for some chicken nachos.  So good.  It was PACKED on a Friday night, but we still managed to get a table.  Even though it was crowded, the line moved quickly and food still came out without me getting hangry.  I definitely recommend the nachos, they're on point:  good ratio of toppings, crisp chips, and a side of salsa from the salsa bar.   YUM.
Love this place...food is still amazing.  Vegetarian beans are still here! I always get the mushroom enchiladas with no queso fresco and green sauce. mmm!They have a sauce bar with some yummy sauces.
Delicious burritos!!! My boyfriend's favorite is the garlic shrimp - so amazing. Juicy pieces of shrimp - mouth is watering now - and the garlic flavor is strong so if you're on a date, share it so neither of you have to worry about your breath haha.I did a bit of a custom order with the wild mushrooms and al pastor super baby burrito. It was the size of a regular burrito which was surprising considering it was "baby" but no complaints here! Great flavor and texture - I was super satisfied!!Really personable staff (:
