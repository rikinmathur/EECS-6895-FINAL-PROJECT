TL;DR - There's a reason SOOOOO many people love this place; its amazing!Vibes:- Simple and clean, a little dark, but who cares.Price:- Fair for quality and quantityFood:- GET THE FRY FRECTA.  You're welcome. - The burgers are amazing and you can't go wrong with any choice. Overall, better than super duper, shake shack, in n out (don't hate!)
The raving reviews on Yelp were the reason I went here! Was looking for a good burger place in the marina and I definitely enjoyed my burger here. Located on  Union Street, they have a small terrace out front and a bunch of indoor seating. The restaurant is self-order style, whereby you order at the counter and go find a table and they bring it to you.We each ordered a burger and one side of fries to share and a lemonade.  The lemonade was really good, made with real lemon and very refreshing! The fries were also delicious. As for burgers,  I had some sort of Mexican-inspired burger with avocado, jalopenos, and tortilla. It was okay, the tortillas were a bit much, and made it very difficult to eat. The second burger we had was the French frie burger - interesting idea but the fries on the burger didn't add much. Sometime I think I should just stick to the the classic burger.  Either way, the food was good!
The most delicious burger I have ever tasted, with a side of perfect fries. Ordered the Sunny Side burger with beef, the Heritage burger with elk, and the Fry Fecta (steel bowl of russet fries, sweet potato fries and zucchini onion string fries). Asked the waiter for extra sauce for the fries and he brought back samples of house sauce and herb mayo, which was above and beyond what we needed for our fries. The Sunny Side burger with beef had hands-down the best cooked beef patty I have ever tasted. Juicy, flavorful, and a perfect portion size. Eat it quickly because the bottom bun soaks up all of those delicious juices and gets soggy. The Heritage burger with elk had the perfect toppings- bacon, mouthwatering caramelized onions and herb mayo. This was my first time trying elk. It's rather lean, not very juicy, and gamey. I will get this burger with beef next time and yes, there will be a next time. Get the Fry-Fecta. All three varieties were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. Portion is substantial, so bring a hungry friend or two. Other things: Order first, grab a seat, prop up your number, get your own water and condiments, and a waiter will bring you your piece of sustainable, clean comfort food heaven. The decor is inviting and warm. It's a bit crowded, but still a good place for a date or hanging out with a friend or two. Can't say this enough- best beef burger ever.
Wanted to try a new burger place in SF, so we decided to give this place a shot. It's not a traditional type of restaurant where you're seated and have a waiter. It's more of a you order, find a seat and they will bring the food out to you type of place. Only problem with that is this is SF, the location is small, and there are a ton of people. Good luck finding a seat. However, besides that, the food itself is pretty good. Not the best burger I've ever had, but I didn't leave disappointed. They also have the bison option, so if you don't want to eat Mrs. Cow, then you can eat Mr. Buffalo instead. They also have an option to call the Fry-fecta which allows you to try all three fries. A pretty good idea. If you like burgers, and are in SF give it a shot. It's not the greatest burger place in SF, but it's a worthy contender.
My go to place for a good burger. Order and find a seat. They will bring the burgers when it's ready. Dim lighting, lots of seats, but when they get busy, it might be hard to get a table. Services always friendly. First you choose your protein and I always pick **BEEF, **Medium Rare. And I normally and always created my own. I had **House Sauce and Mix it with the **House HOT sauce they provide for you at the condiment table. Their Herb Ranch is good as well. I add **Butter Lettuce, **Tomato, **House-Made Pickles and **Onion. FYI all free. With **Pepper Jack. And debating on my mood, I love to add **Avocado, **Egg or **Bacon. And when im hungry, I add all 3 and its amazing, messy but so yummy! You can also add their **Truffle Parmesan Fries inside your burger. I love their Truffle Parmesan Fries as well as their **Sweet Potato Fries. I do not like the trio tray because its so little. Just go with the full order because their regular fries are so good.
Loveeee Roam Burger! One of the best burgers I've tried in the city. It ranges about $10 for a burger but it is very tasteful. You're able to choose type of patty you want (beef, turkey, bison, veggie and elk ($1.99 more). I usually get the the French and Fries burger with Beef which comes with Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard. CAN YOU SAY YUMMMM!! You won't be disappointed.
Amazing burger!!! Came here on a visit to San Francisco, loved it so much I had to grab another before hitting the road home. Such great quality meat, cheese and bun. They also serve soda in a bottle and beer. I ordered the Pacific blue without the steak sauce and replaced it with the house sauce, it was so delicious. Definitely a great choice if your looking for a tasty burger
People love this place. It's decent..I judge a good burger by the power of the patty. The burger patty did not stand out. Super Duper has a good burger patty. Roam was just okay. I got the Sunny Side with an egg, arugula, and cheese. I like their menu and how it has different options. I'd come back again. It isn't an overpriced burger. They forgot to bring me my meyer lemon soda and it caused some confusion for me to ask them to bring me one. They asked me to pay, but I already did. Whatevs. I'll be back sometime.
We all know the "artisan" thing is a bit passé, but let's just pretend they are calling you an artisan and making you burgers because of this title. Now that we've settled this, artisan, I'll spare you any puns about visiting Roam and get on with it.I especially enjoy that you can eat here whether you eat meat or not. A lot of times burger places are dismal when you're not there for the meat, but you have choices here. They offer several meats (beef, turkey, bison and elk), and a variety of salads and veggie dishes that rotate seasonally. I tried both beef and bison burgers (separate trips, no shade) and was happy to receive a pretty picturesque, tasty lunch. The patties were on the slim slide, but the fresh tomato and avocado I added were added compensation. With all the merit badges for their grass fed and local options I appreciate the price point not being that high as well.The salads look to be really nicely sized portions, and you can always tack on a skewer of meat patties with one if you're looking to get some extra protein.Atmosphere: Typical tech-lumber aesthetic, plus a short bar with a TVCrowd: Marina mix-and-match depending on the time of dayTry: Tejano burger - tortilla strips, avocado, a little jalapeño and some ranchWill be back to have a milkshake!
Ahh roam burger with all of your reviews, I knew I needed to stop by on my trip to SF. All of the burgers sounded really good so I had a hard time choosing. I ended up ordering the sunny side beef burger, because of course, anything with an egg must be good. You also have your choice of veggie, turkey and bison. I also got the fry-fecta which is perfect for indecisive people like me. You order at the cash register, get a number and they bring it out to you. We sat at the bar which was cool, as we watched them make milk shakes, sodas and drinks. Our burger came out and the first bite had me drooling. It was simply just an amazing burger with caramelized onions and their home made hot sauce. I scarfed it down and went in on the fries. All of the fries were good but my favorite was the sweet potatoes. Their zucchini fries tasted like crispy onions. This is the spot to go if you're craving a burger!! Definitely satisfying to say the least.
The wait time was really short for a crowded day like today for the Warriors vs Spurs. As the night progressed it was getting more crowded especially for the bar. The food had great flavors, amazing smoked bacon, and juicy beef patties. Although they were pretty big burgers it was a good filing were we didn't feel uncomfortable.The atmosphere is predominantly white and got a little frat boy ratty. The workers were nice and provided great service.As for the sports tv, it was pretty small and not accessible for everyone.Because of the atmosphere we give it an Overall 4/5 we recommend going on a non sports day.
This place is AWESOME! There's a pretty great variety of burgers to choose from, and you also get 4 options as a patty: Beef, Turkey, Bison (which not many places offer) and the veggie option as well for anyone wanting a meat alternative.The food itself was so tasty and very comparable to places like Super Duper and Unami Burger, which are great places in their own right. I feel like it's fair to say that Roam is more on the pricey side (usually about 15-20 per person depending on what you get), but it's also on Union Street, so that's expected. You get what you pay for, and you're paying for yummy goodness.Overall, flavorful food with good proportions, attentive service and a nice location that's cozy yet fun makes this a place I'd highly recommend.
At Roam, you can get a basic burger or go nuts, running off the deep end with ground game, watercress and etc.  I've happily devoured everything I've ordered here.  I also recommend the milk shakes and salads.  The chocolate chip banana bread milkshake du jour we ordered a few weeks ago was divine.The prices are a little high for a burger joint but you can taste the quality of the ingredients.  It's also situated on the quieter end of Union which makes the outside seating a great place to catch up.
A delicious simple burger place that serves great game meat burgers. 1) You order at the counter and they will bring the food to your table. 2) Do try their bison burger.3) Get the Fry-fecta: Zucchini onion haystack, sweet potato fries, and russet fries. A must!Love this place. Order any type of burgers here and you will not be disappointed. I hope you give this awesome burger joint a try. Cheers!
Told my bf I wanted gourment burger, so he took me to this place. We both have never been here but I got to say, this is quite the location. Very small environment, great vibe, quick and great service. Heads, theres no paper menu in front of you, but there is a big chalk board above the bar. Get your reading glasses on and start looking. When we first arrived, I was like oh cool, theres a big menu too..but little did I know theres no menu in front of you. I enjoy this location. Servers are great. Cute decor and great vibeOne thing i absolutely love is watching the cooks make the bun for the burgers. We got a fried chicken sandwich and one burger, which both were amazing! The fries were good, but I felt like the extra addition of green parsley or whatever didn't quite stand out. I loved watching the cooks prepare the bun and see how they rise in the oven and come out. Amazing. No menu for drinks, its located on a column, no well drinks, just beer and wine. Parking is hard to find.
Updated ReviewSo I just had Roam again today and I was BLOWN away. Roam definitely got its 2 stars back with me. I decided to come back again to give them another try and I wasn't disappointed. My burger was cooked to perfection and I had no complaints. I really want to thank the owner Josh for following up with my last review, that was awesome of him. It really showed he takes pride in his business and truly want his costumers happy!!!  I will be back and continue to recommend Roam. Roam burgers is generally pretty good overall but this last time the meat was just a little too rare for me. I probably asked for it well. Truffle Parmesan fries are a must and those never disappoint. Just the right amount of everything without overdoing it.I'll be back to try it again but I'll be sure to mention cooking it longer.
This place is a ABSOLUTE must try if your in the city. I eat here almost every time I come to the city for work.Nice clean casual atmosphere and friendly staff.
Really tasty burgers and a wide selection of dressings/accoutrements for your burger. They have some amazing fries here too... traditional, sweet potato, and an onion/zucchini haystack. If you can't decide you can get the trio and have them all which - which is what we did.They also have beers on tap (hubby's fave - Racer 5) and a selection of milkshakes. I got the Blue Bottle coffee milkshake because hey... burger, shake and fries - you never know what the future brings, live it up! The restaurant is rustic chic and comfortable with a big window in front. There's sidewalk seating as well. I think pricing wise it was a little higher than another of our local SF favorites, but not bad. It's Niman Ranch beef which is high quality. Overall a great place to grab some lunch if you're on your way over the GG Bridge to Sausalito (which is what we were doing). I'm sure we'll be back!
Yummmm! Juiciest burgers I've had in a long time. We stopped by after a late night class and tried it out! So glad we did, I'll definitely be back! You can taste the quality and freshness of the beef in their burgers. They're a bit pricy, but hey, it's SF and super fresh.
If you're craving grass fed meat - look no farther than Roam Artisan Burgers.I've never actually eaten at their physical location - but I have ordered delivery from here and I was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.With an array of burgers - that range from grass fed beef, to free-range turkey, to all natural bison and elk burgers, to organic veggie burgers -  Roam boasts an array of different options to satisfy your food palate.The best part is that you can customize your burger to your heart and stomach's content. You can streamline or build up that burger to pure deliciousness with magical toppings like avocado, egg, applewood smoked bacon, caramelized onions, jalapeño relish, cremini mushrooms, truffle fries, and much more  Roam even offers lettuce wraps and gluten free buns for those that are looking to avoid carbs or gluten. Go big at Roam and be sure to try their sweet potato fries with maple chipotle seasoning or better yet their Fry Fecta - which features, sweet potato fries, russet fries, and a zucchini and onion haystack. Yum! Don't stop at the fries - go the full distance with their decadent organic Straus Family Creamery shakes - which they can even top with bruleed marshmallow.Burgers can be a thing of beauty if done right. Let Roam show you the way.Trust.

And when im hungry, I add all 3 and its amazing, messy but so yummy! You can also add their **Truffle Parmesan Fries inside your burger. I love their Truffle Parmesan Fries as well as their **Sweet Potato Fries. I do not like the trio tray because its so little. Just go with the full order because their regular fries are so good.
Loveeee Roam Burger! One of the best burgers I've tried in the city. It ranges about $10 for a burger but it is very tasteful. You're able to choose type of patty you want (beef, turkey, bison, veggie and elk ($1.99 more). I usually get the the French and Fries burger with Beef which comes with Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard. CAN YOU SAY YUMMMM!! You won't be disappointed.
Amazing burger!!! Came here on a visit to San Francisco, loved it so much I had to grab another before hitting the road home. Such great quality meat, cheese and bun. They also serve soda in a bottle and beer. I ordered the Pacific blue without the steak sauce and replaced it with the house sauce, it was so delicious. Definitely a great choice if your looking for a tasty burger
People love this place. It's decent..I judge a good burger by the power of the patty. The burger patty did not stand out. Super Duper has a good burger patty. Roam was just okay. I got the Sunny Side with an egg, arugula, and cheese. I like their menu and how it has different options. I'd come back again. It isn't an overpriced burger. They forgot to bring me my meyer lemon soda and it caused some confusion for me to ask them to bring me one. They asked me to pay, but I already did. Whatevs. I'll be back sometime.
We all know the "artisan" thing is a bit passé, but let's just pretend they are calling you an artisan and making you burgers because of this title. Now that we've settled this, artisan, I'll spare you any puns about visiting Roam and get on with it.I especially enjoy that you can eat here whether you eat meat or not. A lot of times burger places are dismal when you're not there for the meat, but you have choices here. They offer several meats (beef, turkey, bison and elk), and a variety of salads and veggie dishes that rotate seasonally. I tried both beef and bison burgers (separate trips, no shade) and was happy to receive a pretty picturesque, tasty lunch. The patties were on the slim slide, but the fresh tomato and avocado I added were added compensation. With all the merit badges for their grass fed and local options I appreciate the price point not being that high as well.The salads look to be really nicely sized portions, and you can always tack on a skewer of meat patties with one if you're looking to get some extra protein.Atmosphere: Typical tech-lumber aesthetic, plus a short bar with a TVCrowd: Marina mix-and-match depending on the time of dayTry: Tejano burger - tortilla strips, avocado, a little jalapeño and some ranchWill be back to have a milkshake!
Ahh roam burger with all of your reviews, I knew I needed to stop by on my trip to SF. All of the burgers sounded really good so I had a hard time choosing. I ended up ordering the sunny side beef burger, because of course, anything with an egg must be good. You also have your choice of veggie, turkey and bison. I also got the fry-fecta which is perfect for indecisive people like me. You order at the cash register, get a number and they bring it out to you. We sat at the bar which was cool, as we watched them make milk shakes, sodas and drinks. Our burger came out and the first bite had me drooling. It was simply just an amazing burger with caramelized onions and their home made hot sauce. I scarfed it down and went in on the fries. All of the fries were good but my favorite was the sweet potatoes. Their zucchini fries tasted like crispy onions. This is the spot to go if you're craving a burger!! Definitely satisfying to say the least.
The wait time was really short for a crowded day like today for the Warriors vs Spurs. As the night progressed it was getting more crowded especially for the bar. The food had great flavors, amazing smoked bacon, and juicy beef patties. Although they were pretty big burgers it was a good filing were we didn't feel uncomfortable.The atmosphere is predominantly white and got a little frat boy ratty. The workers were nice and provided great service.As for the sports tv, it was pretty small and not accessible for everyone.Because of the atmosphere we give it an Overall 4/5 we recommend going on a non sports day.
This place is AWESOME! There's a pretty great variety of burgers to choose from, and you also get 4 options as a patty: Beef, Turkey, Bison (which not many places offer) and the veggie option as well for anyone wanting a meat alternative.The food itself was so tasty and very comparable to places like Super Duper and Unami Burger, which are great places in their own right. I feel like it's fair to say that Roam is more on the pricey side (usually about 15-20 per person depending on what you get), but it's also on Union Street, so that's expected. You get what you pay for, and you're paying for yummy goodness.Overall, flavorful food with good proportions, attentive service and a nice location that's cozy yet fun makes this a place I'd highly recommend.
At Roam, you can get a basic burger or go nuts, running off the deep end with ground game, watercress and etc.  I've happily devoured everything I've ordered here.  I also recommend the milk shakes and salads.  The chocolate chip banana bread milkshake du jour we ordered a few weeks ago was divine.The prices are a little high for a burger joint but you can taste the quality of the ingredients.  It's also situated on the quieter end of Union which makes the outside seating a great place to catch up.
A delicious simple burger place that serves great game meat burgers. 1) You order at the counter and they will bring the food to your table. 2) Do try their bison burger.3) Get the Fry-fecta: Zucchini onion haystack, sweet potato fries, and russet fries. A must!Love this place. Order any type of burgers here and you will not be disappointed. I hope you give this awesome burger joint a try. Cheers!
Told my bf I wanted gourment burger, so he took me to this place. We both have never been here but I got to say, this is quite the location. Very small environment, great vibe, quick and great service. Heads, theres no paper menu in front of you, but there is a big chalk board above the bar. Get your reading glasses on and start looking. When we first arrived, I was like oh cool, theres a big menu too..but little did I know theres no menu in front of you. I enjoy this location. Servers are great. Cute decor and great vibeOne thing i absolutely love is watching the cooks make the bun for the burgers. We got a fried chicken sandwich and one burger, which both were amazing! The fries were good, but I felt like the extra addition of green parsley or whatever didn't quite stand out. I loved watching the cooks prepare the bun and see how they rise in the oven and come out. Amazing. No menu for drinks, its located on a column, no well drinks, just beer and wine. Parking is hard to find.
Updated ReviewSo I just had Roam again today and I was BLOWN away. Roam definitely got its 2 stars back with me. I decided to come back again to give them another try and I wasn't disappointed. My burger was cooked to perfection and I had no complaints. I really want to thank the owner Josh for following up with my last review, that was awesome of him. It really showed he takes pride in his business and truly want his costumers happy!!!  I will be back and continue to recommend Roam. Roam burgers is generally pretty good overall but this last time the meat was just a little too rare for me. I probably asked for it well. Truffle Parmesan fries are a must and those never disappoint. Just the right amount of everything without overdoing it.I'll be back to try it again but I'll be sure to mention cooking it longer.
This place is a ABSOLUTE must try if your in the city. I eat here almost every time I come to the city for work.Nice clean casual atmosphere and friendly staff.
Really tasty burgers and a wide selection of dressings/accoutrements for your burger. They have some amazing fries here too... traditional, sweet potato, and an onion/zucchini haystack. If you can't decide you can get the trio and have them all which - which is what we did.They also have beers on tap (hubby's fave - Racer 5) and a selection of milkshakes. I got the Blue Bottle coffee milkshake because hey... burger, shake and fries - you never know what the future brings, live it up! The restaurant is rustic chic and comfortable with a big window in front. There's sidewalk seating as well. I think pricing wise it was a little higher than another of our local SF favorites, but not bad. It's Niman Ranch beef which is high quality. Overall a great place to grab some lunch if you're on your way over the GG Bridge to Sausalito (which is what we were doing). I'm sure we'll be back!
Yummmm! Juiciest burgers I've had in a long time. We stopped by after a late night class and tried it out! So glad we did, I'll definitely be back! You can taste the quality and freshness of the beef in their burgers. They're a bit pricy, but hey, it's SF and super fresh.
If you're craving grass fed meat - look no farther than Roam Artisan Burgers.I've never actually eaten at their physical location - but I have ordered delivery from here and I was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.With an array of burgers - that range from grass fed beef, to free-range turkey, to all natural bison and elk burgers, to organic veggie burgers -  Roam boasts an array of different options to satisfy your food palate.The best part is that you can customize your burger to your heart and stomach's content. You can streamline or build up that burger to pure deliciousness with magical toppings like avocado, egg, applewood smoked bacon, caramelized onions, jalapeño relish, cremini mushrooms, truffle fries, and much more  Roam even offers lettuce wraps and gluten free buns for those that are looking to avoid carbs or gluten. Go big at Roam and be sure to try their sweet potato fries with maple chipotle seasoning or better yet their Fry Fecta - which features, sweet potato fries, russet fries, and a zucchini and onion haystack. Yum! Don't stop at the fries - go the full distance with their decadent organic Straus Family Creamery shakes - which they can even top with bruleed marshmallow.Burgers can be a thing of beauty if done right. Let Roam show you the way.Trust.
TL;DR - There's a reason SOOOOO many people love this place; its amazing!Vibes:- Simple and clean, a little dark, but who cares.Price:- Fair for quality and quantityFood:- GET THE FRY FRECTA.  You're welcome. - The burgers are amazing and you can't go wrong with any choice. Overall, better than super duper, shake shack, in n out (don't hate!)
The raving reviews on Yelp were the reason I went here! Was looking for a good burger place in the marina and I definitely enjoyed my burger here. Located on  Union Street, they have a small terrace out front and a bunch of indoor seating. The restaurant is self-order style, whereby you order at the counter and go find a table and they bring it to you.We each ordered a burger and one side of fries to share and a lemonade.  The lemonade was really good, made with real lemon and very refreshing! The fries were also delicious. As for burgers,  I had some sort of Mexican-inspired burger with avocado, jalopenos, and tortilla. It was okay, the tortillas were a bit much, and made it very difficult to eat. The second burger we had was the French frie burger - interesting idea but the fries on the burger didn't add much. Sometime I think I should just stick to the the classic burger.  Either way, the food was good!
The most delicious burger I have ever tasted, with a side of perfect fries. Ordered the Sunny Side burger with beef, the Heritage burger with elk, and the Fry Fecta (steel bowl of russet fries, sweet potato fries and zucchini onion string fries). Asked the waiter for extra sauce for the fries and he brought back samples of house sauce and herb mayo, which was above and beyond what we needed for our fries. The Sunny Side burger with beef had hands-down the best cooked beef patty I have ever tasted. Juicy, flavorful, and a perfect portion size. Eat it quickly because the bottom bun soaks up all of those delicious juices and gets soggy. The Heritage burger with elk had the perfect toppings- bacon, mouthwatering caramelized onions and herb mayo. This was my first time trying elk. It's rather lean, not very juicy, and gamey. I will get this burger with beef next time and yes, there will be a next time. Get the Fry-Fecta. All three varieties were so good, I couldn't pick a favorite. Portion is substantial, so bring a hungry friend or two. Other things: Order first, grab a seat, prop up your number, get your own water and condiments, and a waiter will bring you your piece of sustainable, clean comfort food heaven. The decor is inviting and warm. It's a bit crowded, but still a good place for a date or hanging out with a friend or two. Can't say this enough- best beef burger ever.
Wanted to try a new burger place in SF, so we decided to give this place a shot. It's not a traditional type of restaurant where you're seated and have a waiter. It's more of a you order, find a seat and they will bring the food out to you type of place. Only problem with that is this is SF, the location is small, and there are a ton of people. Good luck finding a seat. However, besides that, the food itself is pretty good. Not the best burger I've ever had, but I didn't leave disappointed. They also have the bison option, so if you don't want to eat Mrs. Cow, then you can eat Mr. Buffalo instead. They also have an option to call the Fry-fecta which allows you to try all three fries. A pretty good idea. If you like burgers, and are in SF give it a shot. It's not the greatest burger place in SF, but it's a worthy contender.
My go to place for a good burger. Order and find a seat. They will bring the burgers when it's ready. Dim lighting, lots of seats, but when they get busy, it might be hard to get a table. Services always friendly. First you choose your protein and I always pick **BEEF, **Medium Rare. And I normally and always created my own. I had **House Sauce and Mix it with the **House HOT sauce they provide for you at the condiment table. Their Herb Ranch is good as well. I add **Butter Lettuce, **Tomato, **House-Made Pickles and **Onion. FYI all free. With **Pepper Jack. And debating on my mood, I love to add **Avocado, **Egg or **Bacon.
