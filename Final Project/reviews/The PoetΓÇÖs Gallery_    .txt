Surprisingly, this was a pretty cool gallery.  Organized by a local group of poets and artists, and subsidized by the building owner (also the owner of North Beach Pizza across the street), the group was able to exist rent-free or nearly rent free for a few months, and then was set free to find themselves a new space.lHowever, while they were open, they exhibited some wonderful art work and hosted some excellent poetry readings.  Keep an eye/ear out for the next Poet's gallery.
