While hosting an event at Exploratorium and working with McCall's catering, they brought in Velocity Circus to provide a fun welcome to our guests - stilt walkers.  The walkers were fun, entertaining and brought a smile to all of our guests as they arrived.  I would definitely hire them again and utilizes the other creative arts they have to offer.
Ive had the extreme pleasure of working with Gregangelo and Velocity Entertainment many times over the past 4 years. They performed an amazing Parcour demonstration at The Craneway Pavilion for our group of Ad-Agency Creatives, sang opera in A giant freezer and delighted me to tears on more than one occasion. If I could measure my gratitude and appreciation in chivalry, I'd throw my cape over a puddle for them. Any day ! !  Wholehearted memorable.
I have seen Gregangelo Circus perform at the De Young Museum and other venues.  They transport you with their magic and costumes and characters.  Impossible to forget and also impossible to describe.  it is literally out-of-this-world so.... if you have a chance to hire them, prepare to be impressed!
I recently hired Velocity Circus for an alumni gala event our school puts on each year--this year we had a "cirque" theme.  Gregangelo & Velocity Circus exceeded my expectations on every level.  Period.  Their account rep, Jacqie was great to work with, was full of ideas and listened to my requests.  She liaised between Velocity Circus and me and conveyed every detail.  Gregangelo and members of his team were available for a walk-through before our event and understood the program flow for the night---they worked with us to create "wow" performances between some speeches made by school officials.  It was seamless, and the aerial show was jaw-dropping amazing.  The performers themselves did a perfect job entertaining and wowing our guests.  The stilt walkers and costumed characters really lifted the energy of the room, got people on the dance floor, made people laugh, and generally made for a spectacular evening of "amazement and wonder."   I have never seen so much enthusiasm out of our guests before.  I was so impressed with the talent, skill and professionalism of Velocity Circus. Our guests loved every minute and will be raving about the event for a long time.  I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Gregangelo & Velocity Circus and would work with them again in a heartbeat.
