Wandered in here at about midnight after a night of gallivanting about the Mission. One of the few food places open at that hour and my expectations were low.  However, the food was amazing and perfect for me and my tipsy friends. The tables are draped with paper and have crayons that you can draw with while you nom your noms. Fun! At one point, a member of our party abruptly wandered out into the Mission and never came back. We still don't know where he is, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ nbd.Would definitely return to Starboard on a late night!
Great place for late night food if you're over burrito/pizza/street dogs.Highly recommended chowder, hush puppies. Service is on point. Only gripe is wine pours are small - pours are probably 4.5oz
Starboard is a home run! The food is comforting, delicious and very well priced. Our group of foodie friends drove up from the South Bay to check out the new restaurant. We were not disappointed. Every dish that we ordered was really good. Many new restaurants struggle to work out the kinks when they first open. Starboard has none of those issues. The service was great and super friendly. The food was perfectly seasoned and fresh. We were lucky to try the chicken pot pie on the daily special menu. Excellent! Although, I love Tartine Bakery's bread pudding; I'm going to say that Starboard's Drunken Master Bread Pudding was better! Seriously. Also, the blueberry pancakes were so delicious that we had to order another one for the road. I accidentally left the pancakes in my friend's car. Sadness. He said it tasted really good reheated at 4am with a glass of warm milk. Stinker. Lol We'd be there all the time if it wasn't 60 miles away. It's definitely worth the trek. The late hours make Starboard the perfect hangout after the bars close for the night. Thanks for the amazing food and friendly staff. 5-stars!
Limited menu but good stuff. It's a diner type atmosphere but the food is a bit more upscale than Denny's. Crayons on butcher paper is fun.
Yelp seems to have removed my review, so will rewrite it...I wanted to check out Starboard, before everyone else discovered it. The food was quite good. Between the four of us, we decided the chowder was unique and one of the best. With a limited menu, the feel was that of a food truck without the wheels.
This place is proof that late night munchies can still be classy. Roll in for a french dip -- conveniently located near a bar or club you just left. So much better than waiting in line for 15 minutes for a burrito elsewhere. Interior is beautiful and the workers that I encountered were friendly. The hot sauce is in baby bottles - so somebody has a sense of humor.
The Mission finally has a real "go to" for late night eats! I was running to an 11p screening at The Victoria Theater and ordered the house made sausage with a side of mashed potatoes and sauteed kale. It was ready in less than ten minutes! Delicious too! Portions are what I expected for the price. Co-owner Susie took my order and made sure I had everything I needed to eat and run to the theater. Plus, I was able to park very close so I tucked my to-go box in my car for warming up when I got home. It's hitting the spot right now! After the movie my friends and I stopped back to find out that Starboard is open until 3a on weekends!! Tue & Weds until 12a! Hell yeah!! I look forward to trying more of their menu the next time I'm out in the Mission.
Absolutely love this place. The Rose wine selection was so amazing. I suggest the French fries with the roast beef and eat them with the juice. It was disgustingly good. The bread pudding special was so good. The staff and the atmosphere was so welcoming and relaxed And did I mention they're open til 3am?
While walking by one of my favorite bars 'Slate' I stumbled upon this next door restaurant starboard,only to find out it is owned by the Slate owners! Walking in to a suttle setting and Hofbrau type of order system I came to order the special of the week which was a ground beef burger with onion ring spicy aioli and grilled sour dough with siracha style fries , and an over easy egg , quite a handful but very delicious , they have a nice set of beer and wine to go with any order you have to, Must try the blue berry pancakes, these things were oozing with blue berries and they stay open till 3 am ! So when your getting out of the bar and don't want to go to the regular taco spot come check out this place!
Really enjoyed everything at this new super cool and cozy spot. I ordered the roast beef which was excellent. I'm a sides guy and have to say you must get the mashed potatoes. It has cheese curds in it! Definitely will be coming here more often
So good! A wonderful variety of delicious comfort foods with a unique twist. House made pickles, chowder, roast beef - all incredible. Both desserts hit the spot. Looking forward to trying more! Decor is quite fun, and the window into next door at Slate will certainly help when you're late night boozing...
The food was amazing and the staff were super-nice.  I got the fish and chips which were perfect, light and crispy and were not too heavy.  My friend got the burger and said it was one of the best she'd ever had.  So props for the food!  The only real negative was the noise - we were there at 9:30 on a Friday night so the club next door was just kicking into gear and the sound was pumping straight through the wall and into the kitchen.  When you add the Starboard sound system to the mix (great music btw) the whole thing just becomes a cacophony.  I am certainly going to go back - for the food as well as to see if it's always like that!
A real gem! People working there are sweethearts. Tried the chowder, pancakes, and caramelized mushrooms. The chowder was hearty and slightly spicy just the way I like it. Pancakes, yep, perfectly fluffy and easy on the eyes. Shrooms could have been more caramelized but they gave us a whole mountain of them and were flavorful and mouthwatering. Great way to top off a night of dancing in the Mission. I have no doubt this place will be packed to the gills during freak hours soon.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The Roast beef was fall apart yumminess, the french fries crunchy with awesome flavors, mushrooms were bomb. I also tried the oysters and I NEVER liked oysters, but at Starboard it was so GOOD!!! They also have a great Rose wine selection. The staff were AMAZING.. It's also open till 3am!!!
I am a chowder enthusiast. Let me tell you I was shocked to discover how DELICIOUS their late night eats were ESPECIALLY the chowder which was a delightful surprise. I can't wait to back tonight for wk co-hosting karaoke @ Slate Bar, so that I can enjoy it again and try more of their late night fare. I want to try the onion rings, mashed potatoes, and carmelized maitake mushrooms too! I can't WAIT.
This new spot is hella good. The bunh mi dip is the truth. The prime rib is tender and juicy and the fact that they use beef pho broth as the Au jus is unheard of. The fruit turnovers are sinfully good. All I can say is don't bring your calorie counter there you'll be in trouble.
I just want to say You Really Should Eat Here! This is an extremely cool & creative team. The place is warm and inviting. The food is simply sublime. The scallion hush puppies & Pho Jus? Pho Me! were a triumph along with the caramelized Maitake mushrooms. Then you must try the blueberry pancakes for dessert-YES!
Seriously good, quality, and fast food in the mission that's open late ! It's nice having a new go to late night spot that won't disappoint ! The rib-eye prime rib is delicious ! The desserts are amazing
Finally a great late night spot that serves high quality food fast and at a price that's affordable. Had the prime dip with pho broth and definitely will be coming back to try rest of menu
Great food, great prices and the service is awesome. Slate Bar next door is one of my favorites, as well!
