Cutest little nook in San Francisco's financial district. Waiting here with a book to meet someone for lunch. It is a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle. Except there are so many birds be careful not to get pooped on.
Empire state of mind.Public Open Space hidden on an already hidden street in the Financial District. Seek it out and you'll find a quiet spot to relax and reflect. Yellow benches add a nice touch of color.Don't mind lingering.
I dedicate this amateurish Haiku to the hidden gem that is Empire Park:Relax on the benchAmong the manicured treesHidden from the world
I came across this little park -though I guess it's more like a plaza- completely by accident when making my way up to North Beach from the FiDi.   It's located on Commercial Street, Tucked in between Kearny and Montgomery.   Lining either side of the entrance are benches and greenery, and overhead is a nice cross work of wooden beams providing some shade.  At the back there is a sunny (or at least open sky) area with metal chairs and tables and also a little fountain on the wall.  Empire Park is a very quaint space especially considering the otherwise cold financial surroundings.  If I worked near it I would definitely make an effort to enjoy my lunch here.  Gotta love the random public spots
Ventured here after it was featured on a Yelp newsletter.  Super cute little spot, hidden in the alley amidst restaurants and office buildings.  It was a little bit after lunchtime and I peacefully read my book on one of the benches.  A few people came in to have lunch or just sit in the sun.  Quiet and very well maintained.  I wish I worked closer to this place.
