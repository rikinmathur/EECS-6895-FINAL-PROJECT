The BEST bun-less burgers in SF! If you are gluten intolerant or paleo and looking for a good burger with no bun, you've got to check out Belly Burgers. They also offer a fantastic roasted kale as a substitute for fries on the side. This is the only place I have ever been to that literally gives you half the entire head of iceberg lettuce for your lettuce wrap in lieu of a bun. The crunch from the fresh lettuce is the perfect compliment to the tasty patty. The pork burgers are deliciously addicting with just the right balance of flavors. When you think pork belly, your mind might automatically think greasy or fatty but these burgers are not that at all. There is just enough fat to add tremendous amounts of flavor without it tasting fatty or oily. It is always grilled to perfection with just a hint of char on the outside to have a slight crunch. The Classic Burger should be the first thing you try because it comes with a fried chili mayo which is so good that I could eat it by the bucket. Apparently Chef Tom makes it from scratch every morning and you can tell it's not just a simple mayo spread by the spice kick and depth of flavor it gives to the burger. I make my husband drive us to SF from East Bay every couple of weeks just so that I can have a lettuce wrap classic pork burger with green chili mayo and an order of the roasted kale. The food is always consistent and we are always reminded why this is one of our favorite burger joints when we go back.
I really had high hopes for this place (as, it seems, did so many others). While it came with a great resume, I think Big Chef Tom's burgers are best consumed outdoors and with a few beers in your belly. As a standalone brick-and-mortar, this place was only subpar. I'd like to comment about the location and venue, which isn't in a great spot and has months of graffiti littering it's floor-to-ceiling windows making for an unappealing experience from the get-go, but I'll just stick to reviewing the food. We attempted the Philly Porker, Firecracker, Kale and Half & Half and have enjoyed the All American before. Both burgers were with the pork belly. The Firecracker, while it lived up to its name, doesn't taste like anything. The bun is without flavor, the meat is bland and colorless, and the cheese was only half melted onto the bun while the other half stuck out like a sore thumb. Made haphazardely though there was only one other couple in the joint (aka the chef wasn't swamped and shouldn't have made an error). The Philly Porker was a little better with seasoned, well-sauteed brocooli rabe but there wasn't anything special about it. The pork belly was forgettable. I enjoy the thin onion ring strips and french fries, but if they claimed to have herbed salt on them, I didn't taste it. The kale was embarrasing and shouldn't be $4. It's hardly seasoned and was very bland. My recommendation is that Big Chef Tom, whose name is on the joint, spend a little more time at his restaurant. It needs some serious help.
Came here on a Friday night. The restaurant was empty. I had high hopes for this place as I've had their burgers before at off the grid and enjoyed them, but what I experienced at the restaurant was drastically different. I love good burgers and this just wasn't one of them.The burgers here are larger than the ones served at their food truck, which most people would say is a good thing, but I found it to be a really sloppy, greasy mess. We were a party of 4 and every single person's food was soggy and drowning in a pool of oil. I ate about 1/3 of my burger and tossed the rest because I felt like I was drinking oil rather than eating a delicious burger. I felt the same way about the fries, most of which were soggy from, you guessed it, the oil.  The pork patties had no real flavor and the 2 most talked about burgers on yelp were a huge disappointment. Truck Stop was beyond greasy and banh baby banh was stuffed with the most cilantro I have ever seen stuffed into anything in my entire life.Sadly, with so many other delicious burger spots in this city, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to return here :(
These burgers are like no other. It's absolutely deliciousness! You would think it might be greasy or too heavy but it's not. There are a variety of choices of toppings/styles. If for some reason you didn't want pork belly patty, there is chicken and veggie as options. The service is very friendly and they are accommodating. It will definitely warrant a return!
Best burgers I've ever had and cheese fries to top it off I absolutely love this place if you ever see it stop immediately and get yourself a burger
Food was great , server was excellent I will definitely return. I recommend the Philly Poker ... Amazingly delicious
That burger was filling as heck, but tasty, especially on a half a head of iceberg, which tempers the saltiness of the pork belly. The side of kale was gargantuan. Lots of Mayo, which I like. Tasty!!! (Big empty kind of awkward space and lots of homeless coming through and using the bathroom.)
Yes, even if the name of the restaurant has Pork Belly in it, I ordered the veggie burger! I had heard it was great, I had to try it!The patty strongly tasted like eggplants. A pretty unique taste since you usually find veggie burgers tasting like a mix of veggies, black beans and/or chickpeas. It was a little too soft, falling apart as I ate the burger but I really enjoyed the taste.The bun was soft and yummy. The Rosemary mayonnaise is off the chains, I recommend you trying it!I had a side of Cole slaw with roasted almonds on top, I loved it! Pretty big side.I also liked that they had unsweetened iced-tea in their drinks section.The inside is actually pretty spacious (and clean) for a fast casual joint which was cool. You should definitely go if you're in the area!
Love the flavors, love the ingredients and I love Chef Tom's Pork Belly Burgers. This place is so so good. We had the special Hog Heaven (which should be a menu staple) and The Truck Stop. I've had the truck stop delivered before and it was super soggy so getting it first hand off the grill was a completely different experience. Their "secret sauce" puts McDonald's and In n Out to shame! Fresh ingredients, unique combinations and a good bun is what makes a burger experience great and this was a great burger.They were having issues with the register so it was super slow and they had to take down all the information by hand including payment. Really surprised me that this place doesn't have square? Other than that this place rocks!
I ordered Philly Porker and added Chop slaw and onion but They didnt put them..I guess they forgot by mistake but since I already paid for them, I feel bad...
This place is legit. I just moved in the area. The place is clean and it is close and you almost want to have it for dinner every day. The staff are polite and friendly and I live right above them so the temptation to come back for more is always there.
Sad to say I REALLY wanted to like this place more.It loses a star for being super cold AND super loud.  But gains a point for the fantastic Yelp deal of a free large side with check in.I had wanted that burger with the broccoli rabe since it opened. But it was kinda fishy tasting - maybe the rabe was sautéed with anchovy paste?? anyway I didn't care for it.  My man had the pork burger with bacon jalapeños and cheese.  I got the side of onion strings and my man got the loaded fries with cheese, sauce and onions, they were a greasy brick of fries.  The onion rings were the preferred. Also did enjoy that they have seltzer water in fountain form.
I was pleasantly surprised by this place!  I had my doubts about a 100% pork patty and was expecting a small burger based on Yelp pictures but my burger had a thick juicy 3/4" patty. I found that I did not miss beef one bit when eating this burger since it was so juicy and flavorful.  I ordered the Firecracker and it had a good amount of heat without being overly spicy (i.e., not one of those diablo burgers that's on the house if you can finish it in x amount of time).  One of the most enjoyable elements was that the inside edges of the bun were nicely toasted (with butter or fat, mmm) which added texture and allowed the bun to stand up to the juicy pork patty. My only disappointment was that the fries were hit or miss - some crisp, some not.  But given that I was full from the burger alone, next time I'll return just for that!
Food stand at outsidelands. Pork belly burger - 2/5 - Burger patty was too thin. This led to it not being moist enough. Apples were a nice touch. Bun could have been better.Overall, in a town with countless pork belly burgers and dishes, skimping on the meat means an automatic "I've experienced better."
These are seriously the most San Francisco burgers you'll find.Instead of your standard hamburger patty, Belly burgers are 100% ground pork belly. Soooo San Francisco - and so good.The Firecracker with serrano lemon jam, cabbage slaw, and pepper jack cheese was so spicy that it made my eyelids sweat... and I'm the kind of person who carries hot sauce around in her handbag. You can taste that everything is fresh and quality-made. They have all sorts of sauces for you to order like lime cumin mayo, rosemary mayo, and fried chili pepper mayo. Ketchup just doesn't do it anymore, ya know? You can get Belly Burgers delivered to your office off of Doordash for super cheap. These guys get backed up during the lunch hours though, so be aware. Finally, these are some not-so-San Francisco prices, as all but one burger on their menu is $8.95 or under.
I was an even bigger fan when this joint first opened. 'member, you member..?!Back when the pork patties were small as shit, but gooder than a bitxh. As of recent though, the burgers have caught up to your average american; fat and just good enough to get by.
Best Burger in SF handsdown. Im not much of a pork person but this bellyburger is crispy and juicey on a fresh bun with everything made inhouse. This is my go to spot for burgers and brews.  -Chef Kyle
My friends and I were supposed to go to different burger shop, but they were closed today. Then we found this place on Yelp, and decided to give a shot. It was a small restaurant but people finished food fast so it was easy to get a table. I ordered the pork belly trunk stop which was creamy and delicious. I also got a free side order of super fries by checking in ! I was very satisfied with the burger and fries ! I will definitely come back to try different types of burgers !
Yeah, so, my other half cannot medically digest beef without serious consequences. In layman's terms: no hamburgers allowed. What to do? Well, such places as HERE serve the exact delicious pork alternative we were seeking!I ordered their Gringo as a Double Pork Burger: came with cumin mayo, charred peppers & onions, and pepper jack. Also got a Summer Shandy beer on tap. Refreshing!My Gringo pork burger was so creatively fantastic, I don't know that I can do it justice describing it here in this sentence, but Big Chef Tom's is the only burger location besides In-N-Out in a long while to earn my full 5-stars alone on solid bursting flavor!Their Bahn Baby Bahn, a Vietnamese pork burger that my partner selected, was also pretty great.They do serve plenty of sides, like fries (can become "super fries"), crispy onions, roasted kale and fresh jalapeños. We knew by getting "double burgers," we would be stuffed already!This is a few steps above fast food for sure. Each pork burger is still made to order, there was a devout interest behind the counter, and patrons could eat at their own pace inside. Great spot to chillax over pork -- burgers have reentered our diets!
I love pork and I am allergic to pork. I love burgers and I eat burgers. I love spicy and I make sure my food is spicy. So what could possibly be wrong when you put all three together into a meal? Apparently enough to make me question some of my crazy burger ideas.So back to how I'm allergic to pork. It won't kill me but it'll give me one hell of a headache and a sore stomach so I choose my battles carefully when dealing with anything pork (insert bacon with sad face drawn on it).When my friend told me about this place, I was willing to risk a headache and then some to try what I'd only conceived of in my wildest of imaginations and seemed like a dream come true.But alas, the burger itself was not spicy at all, though I was thoroughly warned that it most surely was by the hipster behind the counter, and it was actually a bit bland. Now, I've had really amazing pork belly sandwiches/burgers (Porchetta's in Toronto) so I had come to expect something similar, crispy pork skin crackling perfectly cured atop soft and buttery bread with a dash of lettuce for a watery crunch.I was a little wrong.The pork patty was cooked well, but did not have those delicious pork flavors. Instead, it was bland that ketchup couldn't have saved. And the bread was a bit stiff. It did have a little bit of spice to it but it came mostly from the flavored, kimchi-like toppings, which I thought was a brilliant idea, just not executed right.The fries were just ok. Nothing special.I loved the location though. The windows (or lack of them) opened up to the outside completely which was nice to catch the evening breeze. There's bar-like counters with stools to eat from but it seemed like most people ordered their food to go.Maybe I was hoping too much for something similar to Porchetta's or maybe my expectations were too high for the perfect spicy pork burger. Whatever the case, I might come back to try it again at the insistence of someone else but there're too many other places to try honestly to give this place one more shot.Service was good.I was hoping finally to put a burger shop in my top ten list that served a pork burger but I'll keep looking.Parking: Metered streetPrice: $7+Wait: 5-10 mins

This place is legit. I just moved in the area. The place is clean and it is close and you almost want to have it for dinner every day. The staff are polite and friendly and I live right above them so the temptation to come back for more is always there.
Sad to say I REALLY wanted to like this place more.It loses a star for being super cold AND super loud.  But gains a point for the fantastic Yelp deal of a free large side with check in.I had wanted that burger with the broccoli rabe since it opened. But it was kinda fishy tasting - maybe the rabe was sautéed with anchovy paste?? anyway I didn't care for it.  My man had the pork burger with bacon jalapeños and cheese.  I got the side of onion strings and my man got the loaded fries with cheese, sauce and onions, they were a greasy brick of fries.  The onion rings were the preferred. Also did enjoy that they have seltzer water in fountain form.
I was pleasantly surprised by this place!  I had my doubts about a 100% pork patty and was expecting a small burger based on Yelp pictures but my burger had a thick juicy 3/4" patty. I found that I did not miss beef one bit when eating this burger since it was so juicy and flavorful.  I ordered the Firecracker and it had a good amount of heat without being overly spicy (i.e., not one of those diablo burgers that's on the house if you can finish it in x amount of time).  One of the most enjoyable elements was that the inside edges of the bun were nicely toasted (with butter or fat, mmm) which added texture and allowed the bun to stand up to the juicy pork patty. My only disappointment was that the fries were hit or miss - some crisp, some not.  But given that I was full from the burger alone, next time I'll return just for that!
Food stand at outsidelands. Pork belly burger - 2/5 - Burger patty was too thin. This led to it not being moist enough. Apples were a nice touch. Bun could have been better.Overall, in a town with countless pork belly burgers and dishes, skimping on the meat means an automatic "I've experienced better."
These are seriously the most San Francisco burgers you'll find.Instead of your standard hamburger patty, Belly burgers are 100% ground pork belly. Soooo San Francisco - and so good.The Firecracker with serrano lemon jam, cabbage slaw, and pepper jack cheese was so spicy that it made my eyelids sweat... and I'm the kind of person who carries hot sauce around in her handbag. You can taste that everything is fresh and quality-made. They have all sorts of sauces for you to order like lime cumin mayo, rosemary mayo, and fried chili pepper mayo. Ketchup just doesn't do it anymore, ya know? You can get Belly Burgers delivered to your office off of Doordash for super cheap. These guys get backed up during the lunch hours though, so be aware. Finally, these are some not-so-San Francisco prices, as all but one burger on their menu is $8.95 or under.
I was an even bigger fan when this joint first opened. 'member, you member..?!Back when the pork patties were small as shit, but gooder than a bitxh. As of recent though, the burgers have caught up to your average american; fat and just good enough to get by.
Best Burger in SF handsdown. Im not much of a pork person but this bellyburger is crispy and juicey on a fresh bun with everything made inhouse. This is my go to spot for burgers and brews.  -Chef Kyle
My friends and I were supposed to go to different burger shop, but they were closed today. Then we found this place on Yelp, and decided to give a shot. It was a small restaurant but people finished food fast so it was easy to get a table. I ordered the pork belly trunk stop which was creamy and delicious. I also got a free side order of super fries by checking in ! I was very satisfied with the burger and fries ! I will definitely come back to try different types of burgers !
Yeah, so, my other half cannot medically digest beef without serious consequences. In layman's terms: no hamburgers allowed. What to do? Well, such places as HERE serve the exact delicious pork alternative we were seeking!I ordered their Gringo as a Double Pork Burger: came with cumin mayo, charred peppers & onions, and pepper jack. Also got a Summer Shandy beer on tap. Refreshing!My Gringo pork burger was so creatively fantastic, I don't know that I can do it justice describing it here in this sentence, but Big Chef Tom's is the only burger location besides In-N-Out in a long while to earn my full 5-stars alone on solid bursting flavor!Their Bahn Baby Bahn, a Vietnamese pork burger that my partner selected, was also pretty great.They do serve plenty of sides, like fries (can become "super fries"), crispy onions, roasted kale and fresh jalapeños. We knew by getting "double burgers," we would be stuffed already!This is a few steps above fast food for sure. Each pork burger is still made to order, there was a devout interest behind the counter, and patrons could eat at their own pace inside. Great spot to chillax over pork -- burgers have reentered our diets!
I love pork and I am allergic to pork. I love burgers and I eat burgers. I love spicy and I make sure my food is spicy. So what could possibly be wrong when you put all three together into a meal? Apparently enough to make me question some of my crazy burger ideas.So back to how I'm allergic to pork. It won't kill me but it'll give me one hell of a headache and a sore stomach so I choose my battles carefully when dealing with anything pork (insert bacon with sad face drawn on it).When my friend told me about this place, I was willing to risk a headache and then some to try what I'd only conceived of in my wildest of imaginations and seemed like a dream come true.But alas, the burger itself was not spicy at all, though I was thoroughly warned that it most surely was by the hipster behind the counter, and it was actually a bit bland. Now, I've had really amazing pork belly sandwiches/burgers (Porchetta's in Toronto) so I had come to expect something similar, crispy pork skin crackling perfectly cured atop soft and buttery bread with a dash of lettuce for a watery crunch.I was a little wrong.The pork patty was cooked well, but did not have those delicious pork flavors. Instead, it was bland that ketchup couldn't have saved. And the bread was a bit stiff. It did have a little bit of spice to it but it came mostly from the flavored, kimchi-like toppings, which I thought was a brilliant idea, just not executed right.The fries were just ok. Nothing special.I loved the location though. The windows (or lack of them) opened up to the outside completely which was nice to catch the evening breeze. There's bar-like counters with stools to eat from but it seemed like most people ordered their food to go.Maybe I was hoping too much for something similar to Porchetta's or maybe my expectations were too high for the perfect spicy pork burger. Whatever the case, I might come back to try it again at the insistence of someone else but there're too many other places to try honestly to give this place one more shot.Service was good.I was hoping finally to put a burger shop in my top ten list that served a pork burger but I'll keep looking.Parking: Metered streetPrice: $7+Wait: 5-10 mins
The BEST bun-less burgers in SF! If you are gluten intolerant or paleo and looking for a good burger with no bun, you've got to check out Belly Burgers. They also offer a fantastic roasted kale as a substitute for fries on the side. This is the only place I have ever been to that literally gives you half the entire head of iceberg lettuce for your lettuce wrap in lieu of a bun. The crunch from the fresh lettuce is the perfect compliment to the tasty patty. The pork burgers are deliciously addicting with just the right balance of flavors. When you think pork belly, your mind might automatically think greasy or fatty but these burgers are not that at all. There is just enough fat to add tremendous amounts of flavor without it tasting fatty or oily. It is always grilled to perfection with just a hint of char on the outside to have a slight crunch. The Classic Burger should be the first thing you try because it comes with a fried chili mayo which is so good that I could eat it by the bucket. Apparently Chef Tom makes it from scratch every morning and you can tell it's not just a simple mayo spread by the spice kick and depth of flavor it gives to the burger. I make my husband drive us to SF from East Bay every couple of weeks just so that I can have a lettuce wrap classic pork burger with green chili mayo and an order of the roasted kale. The food is always consistent and we are always reminded why this is one of our favorite burger joints when we go back.
I really had high hopes for this place (as, it seems, did so many others). While it came with a great resume, I think Big Chef Tom's burgers are best consumed outdoors and with a few beers in your belly. As a standalone brick-and-mortar, this place was only subpar. I'd like to comment about the location and venue, which isn't in a great spot and has months of graffiti littering it's floor-to-ceiling windows making for an unappealing experience from the get-go, but I'll just stick to reviewing the food. We attempted the Philly Porker, Firecracker, Kale and Half & Half and have enjoyed the All American before. Both burgers were with the pork belly. The Firecracker, while it lived up to its name, doesn't taste like anything. The bun is without flavor, the meat is bland and colorless, and the cheese was only half melted onto the bun while the other half stuck out like a sore thumb. Made haphazardely though there was only one other couple in the joint (aka the chef wasn't swamped and shouldn't have made an error). The Philly Porker was a little better with seasoned, well-sauteed brocooli rabe but there wasn't anything special about it. The pork belly was forgettable. I enjoy the thin onion ring strips and french fries, but if they claimed to have herbed salt on them, I didn't taste it. The kale was embarrasing and shouldn't be $4. It's hardly seasoned and was very bland. My recommendation is that Big Chef Tom, whose name is on the joint, spend a little more time at his restaurant. It needs some serious help.
Came here on a Friday night. The restaurant was empty. I had high hopes for this place as I've had their burgers before at off the grid and enjoyed them, but what I experienced at the restaurant was drastically different. I love good burgers and this just wasn't one of them.The burgers here are larger than the ones served at their food truck, which most people would say is a good thing, but I found it to be a really sloppy, greasy mess. We were a party of 4 and every single person's food was soggy and drowning in a pool of oil. I ate about 1/3 of my burger and tossed the rest because I felt like I was drinking oil rather than eating a delicious burger. I felt the same way about the fries, most of which were soggy from, you guessed it, the oil.  The pork patties had no real flavor and the 2 most talked about burgers on yelp were a huge disappointment. Truck Stop was beyond greasy and banh baby banh was stuffed with the most cilantro I have ever seen stuffed into anything in my entire life.Sadly, with so many other delicious burger spots in this city, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to return here :(
These burgers are like no other. It's absolutely deliciousness! You would think it might be greasy or too heavy but it's not. There are a variety of choices of toppings/styles. If for some reason you didn't want pork belly patty, there is chicken and veggie as options. The service is very friendly and they are accommodating. It will definitely warrant a return!
Best burgers I've ever had and cheese fries to top it off I absolutely love this place if you ever see it stop immediately and get yourself a burger
Food was great , server was excellent I will definitely return. I recommend the Philly Poker ... Amazingly delicious
That burger was filling as heck, but tasty, especially on a half a head of iceberg, which tempers the saltiness of the pork belly. The side of kale was gargantuan. Lots of Mayo, which I like. Tasty!!! (Big empty kind of awkward space and lots of homeless coming through and using the bathroom.)
Yes, even if the name of the restaurant has Pork Belly in it, I ordered the veggie burger! I had heard it was great, I had to try it!The patty strongly tasted like eggplants. A pretty unique taste since you usually find veggie burgers tasting like a mix of veggies, black beans and/or chickpeas. It was a little too soft, falling apart as I ate the burger but I really enjoyed the taste.The bun was soft and yummy. The Rosemary mayonnaise is off the chains, I recommend you trying it!I had a side of Cole slaw with roasted almonds on top, I loved it! Pretty big side.I also liked that they had unsweetened iced-tea in their drinks section.The inside is actually pretty spacious (and clean) for a fast casual joint which was cool. You should definitely go if you're in the area!
Love the flavors, love the ingredients and I love Chef Tom's Pork Belly Burgers. This place is so so good. We had the special Hog Heaven (which should be a menu staple) and The Truck Stop. I've had the truck stop delivered before and it was super soggy so getting it first hand off the grill was a completely different experience. Their "secret sauce" puts McDonald's and In n Out to shame! Fresh ingredients, unique combinations and a good bun is what makes a burger experience great and this was a great burger.They were having issues with the register so it was super slow and they had to take down all the information by hand including payment. Really surprised me that this place doesn't have square? Other than that this place rocks!
I ordered Philly Porker and added Chop slaw and onion but They didnt put them..I guess they forgot by mistake but since I already paid for them, I feel bad...
