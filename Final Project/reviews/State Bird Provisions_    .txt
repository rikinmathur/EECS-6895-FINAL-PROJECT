I am madly in love. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I'm not sure really what I expected to be honest. The food is incredible and the concept is exciting! Carts of goodies being pushed around and offered table side is my new favorite thing ever. Customer service was perfect. The host sadly I'm forgetting his name, but he rocks! If you haven't tried this place, I would leave whatever restraining you're eating at now and go straight here. We didn't have a reservation because they were fully booked- I heard from friends there may be a long wait without one. When we arrived it was full be we only waited about 25 minutes. Not too shabby. I can't wait to come back. Everything was so delicious.
We came here for my birthday dinner, and it was pretty good. While most items were fine, there was one thing that stood out among the rest. The Spicy Pork Sausage Chawanmushi is probably the main reason why SBP gets 4 stars from me. It's like an elevated huevos con chorizo. Execution was on point. The pork was tender, and the eggs were silky smooth. It was also very well thought out. The sweet, smoky pork was well balanced with the pickly olives. Topped over the perfectly steamed eggs, the whole combination was full flavored and well rounded. I don't even feel like talking about everything else we ate because I'm just gonna say that it wasn't as good as the chawanmushi.
I came with three friends on a Sunday night and thankfully didn't have to wait on one of those notoriously long lines that I've read about.  (Might have been thanks, in part, to a local friend who get there before us; we were visiting from out of town).  The State Bird experience is pretty unique -- you can order off a traditional menu and also order off the dimsum-like carts that make their way from table to table.  We tried a number of dishes: the oysters, two different kinds of mini-pancakes, the duck liver mousse, and several more items.  Despite these delicious dishes, my favorite was seemingly the most simple item: the garlic bread with burrata.  The bread was warm, soft and chewy, and had a lovely garlic flavor that was perfectly complemented by the burrata.  For dessert, we ordered the black sesame angel food cake (with caramelized banana and ginger cream), which sounded super interesting on the menu.  Our server, in fact, told us it was her favorite dessert item.  It was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  No special flavor really stood out... the dessert seemed to lack personality.  Despite the disappointing dessert, I really enjoyed the State Bird experience and am glad we had a chance eat here during our short stay in San Francisco.
One of the best experiences I've had dining in SF. Definitely Michelin star worthy and well worth the two month wait, which is the earliest you can make reservations. As soon as the clock struck midnight, we reserved a table online for two months later. Dining experience: "Fancy dim sum" You have a menu you can order from and they also push around carts with other dishes you can choose from. All dishes are tapas style. We were four people and one dish was just enough for four people to have a taste.Service/ambiance: Outstanding service. Cute/casual atmosphere. Everyone was really friendly and attentive and not pretentious at all. You definitely do not have to dress up to eat here. Everyone was pretty casual, including the servers.Food: We were celebrating our birthdays so had no reservations and grabbed at whatever we thought sounded good. By the end we were extremely stuffed and it ended up being a total of 16 dishes. I won't review them all but the standouts were the Kimchi fried rice (menu) and pork belly (special). You also cannot leave without getting the best ice sandwiches in the world. They were also nice enough to put candles on the sandwiches and sing happy birthday!Also a nice surprise was that I was expecting to drop $100-200 for this meal but it ended up being about $65 per person. Perfect ending to a great meal.
The dining experience started great. Was sat at the chefs table and had a great view of the dishes that were about to be brought out. I passed on the first few, and was enjoying the tapas/dim sum style experience. However over time that eroded as I was continually bombarded with waiter after waiter trying to "sell" you a dish. It took away from the experience and became uncomfortable saying no and seeing the look on their faces. I think this could be an amazing place if they took a different approach and upped the level of service and professionalism. As for the food- it was good, but few dishes were great. The big standout to me was the Caesar asparagus- inventive and well done. Among the misses were the octopus- way too rubbery. I also had to try the State Bird. I can understand a lot of the complaints I read about it but to me, it was just your typical slightly above average fried chicken. Though at $15 for a half order, I think it was on the expensive side. I'd go back but with a different strategy - not care as much about the service and take my time to wait for the dishes I really want.
We were so underwhelmed by this place. No one in our party thought this place was a mind blowing 5 stars. We don't understand why it's so hard to book reservations and why ppl wait in line for hours?We came as a party of three (all first timers). State bird is GLORIFIED DIM SUM (but we all enjoy asian dim sum way more)!We order steak tartar: the steak was cut into small chunks that were chewy and not melt in your mouth nor was it flavorful.A fried pork w Apple compote: the pork was nice and crispy but could've used a touch more saltA pate mouse (?): serve with tiny corn bread the pate was crazy salty we took one bite stared at each otherA marinated tuna tataki: the tuna was a low quality, looked like it could've just been the standard skipjack tunaThe signature state bird: buttermilk fried quail. Anything fried is good so can't complain but I could for sure live w outServer all other dishes I don't care to remember... Like the pancake bites and artichoke toast (ehhh).The highlight of my meal were the oysters and those weren't even cooked. I could eat the whole plate!Service was great!
We waited 30 min for it to open and ... Totally worth the wait. Apparently there is no need to get there early for a Sunday dinner-- there were quite a few empty tables and was no line when we finished around 7:30. Love the food:Best: duck liver mousse, duck prosciutto pancake, oysterSo so: pork bellyI wanted to try the uni... Next time!
Fast forward 3 years later....5 Stars - Must orderQuail - simply an outstanding dishHalibut Spring Roll - clean bold flavors Yogurt Butter-Swordfish Floss Toast - melt in your mouth goodnessBrokaw Avocado - highlights the avocado in the best way possible and textures are amazing Horchata Ice Cream Sandwich - the only complaint is I wish I had more of those delicious strawberries and stronger horchata flavor but honestly, even without that, it was still sensational4 Stars - great but would have been better with tweaksChawanmushi - egg base was silky smooth and packed with flavor but spicy sausage and olive flavors clashed + felt the parmesan cracker added little value to the dishPork Belly Citrus Salad - pork was a tad dried out but other than that, the burst of citrus combined with the heat notes and umami fish sauce came together well Potato Fritter with Bay Shrimp - fritter was delicious and shrimp was cooked well but would have liked less of the ranch sauce (very "mayo" forward) Guinea Hen Dumpling - broth was super intricate and refreshing, dumpling was filled well and worked in harmony with the broth Potato and Shellfish Porridge - eat it with a spoon and you'll find that it taste like a deconstructed clam chowder in the best way possible, a tad on the salty side but well done Beef Tongue Pancake - good grief was this tender, all it needed was a pinch more salt or a sauce to add some moisture to the pancake 3 Stars - middle of the pack, not a must have but not a bad choiceLap cheong - a very nice pepper note that lingers, a good fresh interpretation of chinese sausage Grilled Squid and Ink Noodle - Noodles had an interesting chewy quality but didn't pick up much ink essence and wasn't enough squid, that aside, dashi was goodSteak Tartare - not sure what the purpose was with the uni, that aside the steak quality was superb and seasoned well but would have liked a dash of more salt Duck liver Mousse - very rich and indulgent, what you would expect 2 Stars - fine but nothing specialHog Island Oyster - fresh, but the toppings didn't bring out the oyster Artichoke Butter Bean Toast - highlights the ingredients well but was flat after the first biteCroque Madame - not enough ham, flavors felt lost and underwhelming Lime Granita - far too acidic, didn't get any essence of avocado milk and thought the gelee only further compounded the sourness 1 Star - would not order, waste of funds/caloriesGarlic Bread with Burrata - dough was dry and lacked butter/garlic flavors, burrata was merely there for show Grilled Shiitake - this dish still baffles me, I think I must be missing something...Pistachio Date Turnover - desperately needed sweetness, crust was dry and flavorless Service was friendly and efficient Only beer and wine (try the bret golden ale, best draft they have) Overall ThoughtsIs State Bird hipster dim sum? Sure. Does it get expensive to eat all the things? Yup.Are there disappointing moments? Yes, just like any other restaurant Is it worth the trip? You betcha! =)
Definitely an innovative restaurant worth trying if you can get a reservation. It won't break the bank relative to other Michelin high end establishment but just cause it's decent value it isn't going to be big portions.Everything was very flavorful and well seasoned. Nothing bland.The signature quail (4/5) - very tender. Most actually solid meat the whole nightSmoked fish dip (5/5) - very flavorful and great texture with the chipsFried rice (3/5) - basically kimchi fried rice but with some local greensSteak tartare (3/5) - an innovative take as it is served with a crisp. Probably still not the best steak tartare I've hadGarlic bread with burrata (3/5) - found it to be a greasy knot with some okay burrata on topCarrot Mochi (5/5) - unique to say the least!Ice cream sandwich (5/5) - very well balanced and solid dessertService was great, friendly and with food surrounding you, very fast!
Finally got to try this place after trying to get a reservation for months! Luckily one day I was on opentable and got a reservation at 845pm. This has been one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation! With that said, I was expecting mind blowing food, but it wasn't anything like that. My boyfriend and I came here for date night. We tried many dishes, there were more "just ok" dishes than excellent dishes. Our top favorites were the ca state bird, oolong ice cream sandwiches, mushroom toast and crispy pork belly. The state bird was so crispy and flavorful, usually I hate quail cause it tastes strange but this made me thoroughly enjoy it. The mushroom toast was super flavorful, I'm not sure what they used to marinate those mushrooms but it was so tasty! The oolong ice cream  was amazing, it had a good flavor and it wasn't too sweet! I could have eaten it all by myself but sadly I had to share with my boyfriend. We also had a few other dishes that weren't really good. We tried steak tartare, it was different from what we usually have. They had thick fat chunks instead of small, minced like texture. It was flavorless and bland. The butternut squash Mochi was a bit greasy and a little bland as well, we did not really enjoy these dishes. The final fish that wasn't great was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was tasty but the dough for the garlic bread was greasy and did not have any garlic flavor, it was a bit disappointing. I guess I should have listened to previous yelpers opinions. Overall, this place did not live up to the hype. It was ok but since their menu always changes I wouldn't mind going again to try some of their new dishes.Total for 2: $120
It took 3 years to get here. My friend and I would check for reservations every quarter and it was always always booked. One miracle day, she messages me and says, 'I finally got a reservation!' I thought she was joking at first, and fast forward 2-3 months later, we were sitting there on a Tuesday night. There's so much hype about this place that I was scared of being disappointed. But majority of the dishes were extremely well thought out and tasted delicious. We shared about 16 dishes... That's a lot, there were 3 people in our party and we were so stuffed! Our favorites: dumpling in broth, this was so tasty and the meat flavors with the broth went very well together. Fried pork snack with Apple compote; really nice texture. The signature state bird, has such a nice crunch. I also enjoyed the steak tartar, it was light and delectable. After eating 15 savory dishes, we hardly had any room for dessert. We did manage to try half of an angel cake. It was really nice because it was on the lighter side and they topped it out with this yummy ginger cream.I definitely need to come back to try more dessert, as we ended up devouring everything that passed by.
When my friend wants something for her birthday, I'm going to do my best to make it happen. Even if it means standing for 2 hours in the freezing cold wind and intermittent rain on a busy street in San Francisco in front of a restaurant with no name on its store front.  Yeah.It was a great adventure.  A once in a lifetime experience at a place where reservations are difficult to obtain. You can go standby like we did and be the first in line to make sure that you get in.  We sat at the counter where we were entertained by the chefs. It was so amazing! The food was so different and creative!  They serve small plates like dim sum style by walking around with trays of brilliant goodness such as Sourdough Garlic Bread with Burrata, special Dumplings, Pork Belly, Duck Liver Mousse with almond biscuits, and Potato croquet with Bay Shrimp in Garlic sauce. The servers will mark your bill with tic marks as if you're at a dim sum place. We also selected items from the printed menu: Hedgehog Mushroom Toast, Everything Buckwheat-Beef tongue pastrami pancake, Butternut Squash "mochi " with Brussel sprouts, savory oats and black truffle;  and California State Bird (quail). It was a fabulous and unique dinner. The service was excellent. ..they removed used plates and empty dishes promptly. We were able to order anything from any staff!  (Gabi is from Kaimuki, Hawaii!)  Mahalo!  I'll treasure this memory always!
One of my favorite restaurants in SF, and totally deserving of their Michelin star! I hate waiting in line, so both times I've gone I made a reservation online 60 days in advance. (However, they also have space for walk-in's provided you're willing to wait in line before it opens) The service is like dim sum: waiters bring around carts/trays of small plates and you pick what you'd like to try! (You can also order directly from the kitchen) It's great because you get to try a lot of different dishes and it's helpful to see the food beforehand.My hands-down favorite dish here is the pork belly citrus salad. The pork belly is unbelievably crisp and juicy, and the citrus and herbs add a nice freshness to counterbalance the fattiness of the meat. Other classic favorites include the garlic bread with burrata, and the chips and seafood dip. And for dessert, their ice cream sandwich is whimsical and tasty! I've enjoyed almost everything I've ordered here, so just choose what appeals to you and you really can't go wrong!
Stayed up until midnight in front of the computer and I still couldn't get a table for 2 on a Saturday evening. I ended up reserving a table for 4 at 9:30 on April 2. It was well worth the fight. My SO is still raving about it, asking over and over if we can go again.What we ordered :(***= what I liked most)- Duck liver mouse with almond biscuits**- Chawanmushi*- State bird with provisions***- Chips with smoked salmon dip- Seeded Avocado***- Pork belly citrus salad***- Garlic bread with burrata- Potato Fritter with bay shrimp**- Steak Tartare- Oysters- Red trout***- Kung pao sweetbreads- Grilled octopus- Ice cream sandwich ***- CevicheThe Avocado was so simple and delicious. It may not look like much but it was just the thing we needed halfway through all the proteins. The Pork Belly melted in your mouth and paired perfectly with the citrus. The Garlic Bread was not as great as I hoped it would be, it was just fried dough and was difficult to pull apart. I am hoping to come back in the near future to try other commandables. Fingers crossed that I can get a reservation!
4 star for the experience but 3 stars for the food. American Dim sum is what I call it. Was the food exceptionally great, no, not really. Did 1 of the 10 dishes really stand out that I felt wowed. No. I felt that each dish I had... I know I had it better somewhere else. Maybe they need 1 signature dish.  My thoughts were that all that they served, my beau's mom makes better and didn't charge us an arm and a leg.I suggest going because it is an experience and you can cross it off your list of restaurants to go to. Maybe because of the hype, I expected more but overall, I know my beau left hungry. And he doesn't eat all that much. It is on the pricier side like any tapas place.
After an extremely long wait for a reservation, we enter and are greeted by....no one. We wait in a crowded area for a while until a host appears but doesn't acknowledge us. Finally, he checks us in and says our table isn't ready. He can take our drink order. Several other parties are wondering what to do too. After another wait, we give him our drink order and he corrects the pronunciation of a beer. Gee thanks. He ends up not getting us the drinks and we have to re-order them.This first experience put a damper on the whole meal for us. Don't get swept up in the hype. There are plenty of other restaurants of the same calibre, so I won't be back.It's also extremely loud so I couldn't hear most of the servers well.
Reservations: Booked a table for 2 at 7:00pm on a Tuesday evening two months in advance. Reservations open up 2 months in advance at midnight. For people who don't enjoy waiting for a table, I'd recommend going this route. We were seated promptly upon entry.Food: Dim-sum style plus a menu for specific dishes and desserts. We really couldn't have gone wrong here. I would order every dish that I had that evening again. That being said, there was definitely favorites versus good dishes. Here's my list--3/1/2016 Must Order (dishes in order of deliciousness):-CA state provisions bird-Sesame encrusted avocado-Ice cream sandwich (half portions available)-Albacore white floss on toast-Seafood salsa with nori on top-Guinea hen dumpling with broth-Panna cotta w apricot and a cardamon crisp-Hog island oysters-Blood orange lamb sausage-Duck liver mousse with corn bread-Steak tartare with uni and a rice crisp (rosemary flavor was off putting)Total: ~$130 for two people
I quite enjoyed the food here. I do think this place suffers a little bit from the trendiness making it cooler to people than it actually is - but most of the food is quite good. I don't know why people call this place dim sum style, see, dim sum is supposed to be cheap. When you go to dim sum, it usually costs $20 per person and you're so full you're about to burst. So let's call it what it is...expensive tapas, not dim sum!I came here with a group of people, a big enough party that we all got the prix fixe menu. This was great because we got to try everything on the menu for that day. It seems the menu changes all the time, so I'll break down the highlights of what we had and what I thought: (bear with me, this will be a long review but will hopefully help you narrow down what you want to eat if they're serving the same things at the particular time you're there). Note that we had more things than I listed, but I didn't find certain of them to be super notable - e.g. we had a lamb dish, a tofu & kiwi salad dish, a persimmon dish, and a red trout dish. These were all good, but I didn't find them to be very special. - Hog Island Oyster, Spicy Kohirabi Kraut & Sesame: I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but these oysters were good. One came per person, so it was a nice bite. If you like oysters, I would recommend these. - Smoked Trout with Matsutake & Pork Belly Dashi: I really did not like this. Maybe it's the flavor of dashi that I was not a fan of. But it was a tiny portion of soup and I just didn't think it tasted very good. I've posted a video so you can see the hoopla that goes into presenting the soup to you. - Yogurt Batter-Yellowtail "Floss" Toast: I thought this was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this bite. It's topped with pork floss (I think) and radish. - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit: This is a bite where I was skeptical about the combination - but the mousse perfectly complimented the biscuit. Also, the mousse was quite good - reminded me of duck pate. - Garlic Bread with Burrata: I think behind the yellowtail "floss" toast, this was probably my favorite. It's not a super creative combination like some of the other dishes, but it was super tasty. - Grilled Shiitake with Kosho: I guess I didn't see what was so special about this dish. It was just a shiitake mushroom. I think there are better things on the menu to eat. - Pork Belly Citrus Salad: This salad was delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly. It was tender and had the perfect amount of fattiness on it. Everything in this salad came together really well. - Cast Iron Quail Eggs with Collards, Smoked Feta & Candied Pecan: I'm not a huge fan of quail eggs, but this was absolutely delicious. They fry the quail eggs in the cast iron pan and top it with all the other ingredients. - CA State Bird with Provisions: Everyone raves about this dish. I will explain where I'm coming from. I thought it was alright, but it was not the best fried bird I've ever tasted. I expected much more. I think the reason I felt this way is because I like my fried birds (this was quail) to be extremely flavorful. The brine and the coating both have to be bursting with flavor for me. The flavor in this dish just fell a little short for me. For what it's worth, everyone else at the table loved it! And I think you have to try this dish if you're a meat eater, because it's the name of the restaurant. - Kimchi & Maitake "Fried Rice" A La Plancha with Smoked Egg Bottarga: I really don't think this dish is worth the money. Certain things just don't make sense as something fancy, and kimchi fried rice is one of those dishes. It's one of those dishes where you go to the Asian Ghetto in Berkeley to get for less than $8 (or you make it at home), and it's a comfort food. I thought this was an attempt to make it a fancier dish, which fell short for me. Dessert: Chevre-Rosemary Ice Cream & Cherries & Old Fashioned Cake, candied buddha's hand, white chocolate crunch, ginger cream): This dessert had some good aspects, and some just ok aspects. Overall, I thought it was good. The cake itself wasn't super special (just tasted like chocolate cake), but that white chocolate crunch and candied buddha's hand made it really delicious. The ice cream with cherries was quite delicious!For a drink, I ended up getting the iced tea with yuzu syrup. It think it is meant to be light, but I think it ended up just tasting like something very watered down to me. It is refreshing though!
2/3 visits resulted in a successful meal. First time was no reservation - got put on the wait list and eventually gave up. Second time was from snagging a reservation off a cancellation. That was great - just show up and seats were ready. The third time was on a walking with the last free spot available. Yup, winner, winner, chicken dinner.  The place opens at 5:30 but you don't want to show up later than an hour before if you want to have some hopes of getting in.Almost everything served up here is delicious. Best thing were some chips with guac dip. Those were phenomenal. Bummed that those rotated out on the second visit. Eating at the chef's counter is a great experience. You can witness firsthand on the dishes as they are being put together. If you see anything's good, you can directly request an order. Also, do order the state bird provision from the menu. You'll be glad that you did.
We had a good time at State Bird Provisions, once we found our way inside! It's confusing when you pull up as there is no sign to indicate that you are in the right place. I found this to be a bit pretentious, but nonetheless with two months of preparation, I kept an open mind once the meal began.The food was very inventive to say the least; there are so many different ingredients in unique combinations that you have no idea what to expect when you take a bite. I made the mistake of snacking throughout the day, so I wasn't able to try everything, but we did order much more than we should have just to sample most of the menu. There are 10 dishes that circulate around the restaurant and that you can order on the fly, and there is a separate part of the menu that requires you to order in advance. Also, there are no cocktails here, which was disappointing. They do offer wine and several craft beers if that is any consolation.My favorite dish was the namesake, the CA state bird with provisions. It was crispy, incredibly flavorful, and just all-around delicious. The half portion was plenty for two of us. We also tried the grapefruit and hodo soy tofu salad with miso-chili dressing, and it was light, fruity, and refreshing. The individual dishes are hard to remember as they aren't printed on the menu, but the menu changes frequently anyways so I'll try to describe what I do remember with the help of the website. The hush puppies with slaw were very tasty, and I highly recommend the guinea hen dumpling with broth. I think the smoked trout-avocado "chip & dip" was what we had, and it was quite good as well. The toasts are very interesting and they showcase a surprising cast of ingredients, some of which I haven't even heard of. I recommend ordering two or more toasts and splitting them; you can get about two bites out of each. I tried an oyster and it had nice flavor, but I don't eat enough of them to know if it was well-done. The one dish that didn't stand out was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was too runny, and the bread itself didn't really taste of garlic. We finished off our meal with a margarita granita, which tasted just like a margarita made of shaved ice and had tapioca to add an interesting texture. We needed something light after stuffing ourselves silly, and this fit the bill nicely. I had high expectations going in as this restaurant was all over the food blogs and takes some serious planning to get a reservation. It didn't completely live up to the hype, but that may be due in part to me building it up so much rather than the experience itself. I had no problem getting a 7:15PM reservation on a Sunday, though I did wake up in the middle of the night on the first day they were taking reservations. There was no line at the restaurant itself the whole time we were there, so maybe word is getting around that there is no use in trying (it's a small space), or perhaps the hype is dying down? Overall, the food here was very unique and well-executed. I've had meal experiences I have enjoyed more (Liholiho Yacht Club and Foreign Cinema come to mind), but State Bird Provisions still makes it high on my list. Obviously, the gimmick factor (Californian food served dim sum-style) likely plays into a lot of the hype, but the food can certainly stand on its own.
I am madly in love. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I'm not sure really what I expected to be honest. The food is incredible and the concept is exciting! Carts of goodies being pushed around and offered table side is my new favorite thing ever. Customer service was perfect. The host sadly I'm forgetting his name, but he rocks! If you haven't tried this place, I would leave whatever restraining you're eating at now and go straight here. We didn't have a reservation because they were fully booked- I heard from friends there may be a long wait without one. When we arrived it was full be we only waited about 25 minutes. Not too shabby. I can't wait to come back. Everything was so delicious.
We came here for my birthday dinner, and it was pretty good. While most items were fine, there was one thing that stood out among the rest. The Spicy Pork Sausage Chawanmushi is probably the main reason why SBP gets 4 stars from me. It's like an elevated huevos con chorizo. Execution was on point. The pork was tender, and the eggs were silky smooth. It was also very well thought out. The sweet, smoky pork was well balanced with the pickly olives. Topped over the perfectly steamed eggs, the whole combination was full flavored and well rounded. I don't even feel like talking about everything else we ate because I'm just gonna say that it wasn't as good as the chawanmushi.
I came with three friends on a Sunday night and thankfully didn't have to wait on one of those notoriously long lines that I've read about.  (Might have been thanks, in part, to a local friend who get there before us; we were visiting from out of town).  The State Bird experience is pretty unique -- you can order off a traditional menu and also order off the dimsum-like carts that make their way from table to table.  We tried a number of dishes: the oysters, two different kinds of mini-pancakes, the duck liver mousse, and several more items.  Despite these delicious dishes, my favorite was seemingly the most simple item: the garlic bread with burrata.  The bread was warm, soft and chewy, and had a lovely garlic flavor that was perfectly complemented by the burrata.  For dessert, we ordered the black sesame angel food cake (with caramelized banana and ginger cream), which sounded super interesting on the menu.  Our server, in fact, told us it was her favorite dessert item.  It was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  No special flavor really stood out... the dessert seemed to lack personality.  Despite the disappointing dessert, I really enjoyed the State Bird experience and am glad we had a chance eat here during our short stay in San Francisco.

We waited 30 min for it to open and ... Totally worth the wait. Apparently there is no need to get there early for a Sunday dinner-- there were quite a few empty tables and was no line when we finished around 7:30. Love the food:Best: duck liver mousse, duck prosciutto pancake, oysterSo so: pork bellyI wanted to try the uni... Next time!
Fast forward 3 years later....5 Stars - Must orderQuail - simply an outstanding dishHalibut Spring Roll - clean bold flavors Yogurt Butter-Swordfish Floss Toast - melt in your mouth goodnessBrokaw Avocado - highlights the avocado in the best way possible and textures are amazing Horchata Ice Cream Sandwich - the only complaint is I wish I had more of those delicious strawberries and stronger horchata flavor but honestly, even without that, it was still sensational4 Stars - great but would have been better with tweaksChawanmushi - egg base was silky smooth and packed with flavor but spicy sausage and olive flavors clashed + felt the parmesan cracker added little value to the dishPork Belly Citrus Salad - pork was a tad dried out but other than that, the burst of citrus combined with the heat notes and umami fish sauce came together well Potato Fritter with Bay Shrimp - fritter was delicious and shrimp was cooked well but would have liked less of the ranch sauce (very "mayo" forward) Guinea Hen Dumpling - broth was super intricate and refreshing, dumpling was filled well and worked in harmony with the broth Potato and Shellfish Porridge - eat it with a spoon and you'll find that it taste like a deconstructed clam chowder in the best way possible, a tad on the salty side but well done Beef Tongue Pancake - good grief was this tender, all it needed was a pinch more salt or a sauce to add some moisture to the pancake 3 Stars - middle of the pack, not a must have but not a bad choiceLap cheong - a very nice pepper note that lingers, a good fresh interpretation of chinese sausage Grilled Squid and Ink Noodle - Noodles had an interesting chewy quality but didn't pick up much ink essence and wasn't enough squid, that aside, dashi was goodSteak Tartare - not sure what the purpose was with the uni, that aside the steak quality was superb and seasoned well but would have liked a dash of more salt Duck liver Mousse - very rich and indulgent, what you would expect 2 Stars - fine but nothing specialHog Island Oyster - fresh, but the toppings didn't bring out the oyster Artichoke Butter Bean Toast - highlights the ingredients well but was flat after the first biteCroque Madame - not enough ham, flavors felt lost and underwhelming Lime Granita - far too acidic, didn't get any essence of avocado milk and thought the gelee only further compounded the sourness 1 Star - would not order, waste of funds/caloriesGarlic Bread with Burrata - dough was dry and lacked butter/garlic flavors, burrata was merely there for show Grilled Shiitake - this dish still baffles me, I think I must be missing something...Pistachio Date Turnover - desperately needed sweetness, crust was dry and flavorless Service was friendly and efficient Only beer and wine (try the bret golden ale, best draft they have) Overall ThoughtsIs State Bird hipster dim sum? Sure. Does it get expensive to eat all the things? Yup.Are there disappointing moments? Yes, just like any other restaurant Is it worth the trip? You betcha! =)
Definitely an innovative restaurant worth trying if you can get a reservation. It won't break the bank relative to other Michelin high end establishment but just cause it's decent value it isn't going to be big portions.Everything was very flavorful and well seasoned. Nothing bland.The signature quail (4/5) - very tender. Most actually solid meat the whole nightSmoked fish dip (5/5) - very flavorful and great texture with the chipsFried rice (3/5) - basically kimchi fried rice but with some local greensSteak tartare (3/5) - an innovative take as it is served with a crisp. Probably still not the best steak tartare I've hadGarlic bread with burrata (3/5) - found it to be a greasy knot with some okay burrata on topCarrot Mochi (5/5) - unique to say the least!Ice cream sandwich (5/5) - very well balanced and solid dessertService was great, friendly and with food surrounding you, very fast!
Finally got to try this place after trying to get a reservation for months! Luckily one day I was on opentable and got a reservation at 845pm. This has been one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation! With that said, I was expecting mind blowing food, but it wasn't anything like that. My boyfriend and I came here for date night. We tried many dishes, there were more "just ok" dishes than excellent dishes. Our top favorites were the ca state bird, oolong ice cream sandwiches, mushroom toast and crispy pork belly. The state bird was so crispy and flavorful, usually I hate quail cause it tastes strange but this made me thoroughly enjoy it. The mushroom toast was super flavorful, I'm not sure what they used to marinate those mushrooms but it was so tasty! The oolong ice cream  was amazing, it had a good flavor and it wasn't too sweet! I could have eaten it all by myself but sadly I had to share with my boyfriend. We also had a few other dishes that weren't really good. We tried steak tartare, it was different from what we usually have. They had thick fat chunks instead of small, minced like texture. It was flavorless and bland. The butternut squash Mochi was a bit greasy and a little bland as well, we did not really enjoy these dishes. The final fish that wasn't great was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was tasty but the dough for the garlic bread was greasy and did not have any garlic flavor, it was a bit disappointing. I guess I should have listened to previous yelpers opinions. Overall, this place did not live up to the hype. It was ok but since their menu always changes I wouldn't mind going again to try some of their new dishes.Total for 2: $120
It took 3 years to get here. My friend and I would check for reservations every quarter and it was always always booked. One miracle day, she messages me and says, 'I finally got a reservation!' I thought she was joking at first, and fast forward 2-3 months later, we were sitting there on a Tuesday night. There's so much hype about this place that I was scared of being disappointed. But majority of the dishes were extremely well thought out and tasted delicious. We shared about 16 dishes... That's a lot, there were 3 people in our party and we were so stuffed! Our favorites: dumpling in broth, this was so tasty and the meat flavors with the broth went very well together. Fried pork snack with Apple compote; really nice texture. The signature state bird, has such a nice crunch. I also enjoyed the steak tartar, it was light and delectable. After eating 15 savory dishes, we hardly had any room for dessert. We did manage to try half of an angel cake. It was really nice because it was on the lighter side and they topped it out with this yummy ginger cream.I definitely need to come back to try more dessert, as we ended up devouring everything that passed by.
When my friend wants something for her birthday, I'm going to do my best to make it happen. Even if it means standing for 2 hours in the freezing cold wind and intermittent rain on a busy street in San Francisco in front of a restaurant with no name on its store front.  Yeah.It was a great adventure.  A once in a lifetime experience at a place where reservations are difficult to obtain. You can go standby like we did and be the first in line to make sure that you get in.  We sat at the counter where we were entertained by the chefs. It was so amazing! The food was so different and creative!  They serve small plates like dim sum style by walking around with trays of brilliant goodness such as Sourdough Garlic Bread with Burrata, special Dumplings, Pork Belly, Duck Liver Mousse with almond biscuits, and Potato croquet with Bay Shrimp in Garlic sauce. The servers will mark your bill with tic marks as if you're at a dim sum place. We also selected items from the printed menu: Hedgehog Mushroom Toast, Everything Buckwheat-Beef tongue pastrami pancake, Butternut Squash "mochi " with Brussel sprouts, savory oats and black truffle;  and California State Bird (quail). It was a fabulous and unique dinner. The service was excellent. ..they removed used plates and empty dishes promptly. We were able to order anything from any staff!  (Gabi is from Kaimuki, Hawaii!)  Mahalo!  I'll treasure this memory always!
One of my favorite restaurants in SF, and totally deserving of their Michelin star! I hate waiting in line, so both times I've gone I made a reservation online 60 days in advance. (However, they also have space for walk-in's provided you're willing to wait in line before it opens) The service is like dim sum: waiters bring around carts/trays of small plates and you pick what you'd like to try! (You can also order directly from the kitchen) It's great because you get to try a lot of different dishes and it's helpful to see the food beforehand.My hands-down favorite dish here is the pork belly citrus salad. The pork belly is unbelievably crisp and juicy, and the citrus and herbs add a nice freshness to counterbalance the fattiness of the meat. Other classic favorites include the garlic bread with burrata, and the chips and seafood dip. And for dessert, their ice cream sandwich is whimsical and tasty! I've enjoyed almost everything I've ordered here, so just choose what appeals to you and you really can't go wrong!
Stayed up until midnight in front of the computer and I still couldn't get a table for 2 on a Saturday evening. I ended up reserving a table for 4 at 9:30 on April 2. It was well worth the fight. My SO is still raving about it, asking over and over if we can go again.What we ordered :(***= what I liked most)- Duck liver mouse with almond biscuits**- Chawanmushi*- State bird with provisions***- Chips with smoked salmon dip- Seeded Avocado***- Pork belly citrus salad***- Garlic bread with burrata- Potato Fritter with bay shrimp**- Steak Tartare- Oysters- Red trout***- Kung pao sweetbreads- Grilled octopus- Ice cream sandwich ***- CevicheThe Avocado was so simple and delicious. It may not look like much but it was just the thing we needed halfway through all the proteins. The Pork Belly melted in your mouth and paired perfectly with the citrus. The Garlic Bread was not as great as I hoped it would be, it was just fried dough and was difficult to pull apart. I am hoping to come back in the near future to try other commandables. Fingers crossed that I can get a reservation!
4 star for the experience but 3 stars for the food. American Dim sum is what I call it. Was the food exceptionally great, no, not really. Did 1 of the 10 dishes really stand out that I felt wowed. No. I felt that each dish I had... I know I had it better somewhere else. Maybe they need 1 signature dish.  My thoughts were that all that they served, my beau's mom makes better and didn't charge us an arm and a leg.I suggest going because it is an experience and you can cross it off your list of restaurants to go to. Maybe because of the hype, I expected more but overall, I know my beau left hungry. And he doesn't eat all that much. It is on the pricier side like any tapas place.
After an extremely long wait for a reservation, we enter and are greeted by....no one. We wait in a crowded area for a while until a host appears but doesn't acknowledge us. Finally, he checks us in and says our table isn't ready. He can take our drink order. Several other parties are wondering what to do too. After another wait, we give him our drink order and he corrects the pronunciation of a beer. Gee thanks. He ends up not getting us the drinks and we have to re-order them.This first experience put a damper on the whole meal for us. Don't get swept up in the hype. There are plenty of other restaurants of the same calibre, so I won't be back.It's also extremely loud so I couldn't hear most of the servers well.
Reservations: Booked a table for 2 at 7:00pm on a Tuesday evening two months in advance. Reservations open up 2 months in advance at midnight. For people who don't enjoy waiting for a table, I'd recommend going this route. We were seated promptly upon entry.Food: Dim-sum style plus a menu for specific dishes and desserts. We really couldn't have gone wrong here. I would order every dish that I had that evening again. That being said, there was definitely favorites versus good dishes. Here's my list--3/1/2016 Must Order (dishes in order of deliciousness):-CA state provisions bird-Sesame encrusted avocado-Ice cream sandwich (half portions available)-Albacore white floss on toast-Seafood salsa with nori on top-Guinea hen dumpling with broth-Panna cotta w apricot and a cardamon crisp-Hog island oysters-Blood orange lamb sausage-Duck liver mousse with corn bread-Steak tartare with uni and a rice crisp (rosemary flavor was off putting)Total: ~$130 for two people
I quite enjoyed the food here. I do think this place suffers a little bit from the trendiness making it cooler to people than it actually is - but most of the food is quite good. I don't know why people call this place dim sum style, see, dim sum is supposed to be cheap. When you go to dim sum, it usually costs $20 per person and you're so full you're about to burst. So let's call it what it is...expensive tapas, not dim sum!I came here with a group of people, a big enough party that we all got the prix fixe menu. This was great because we got to try everything on the menu for that day. It seems the menu changes all the time, so I'll break down the highlights of what we had and what I thought: (bear with me, this will be a long review but will hopefully help you narrow down what you want to eat if they're serving the same things at the particular time you're there). Note that we had more things than I listed, but I didn't find certain of them to be super notable - e.g. we had a lamb dish, a tofu & kiwi salad dish, a persimmon dish, and a red trout dish. These were all good, but I didn't find them to be very special. - Hog Island Oyster, Spicy Kohirabi Kraut & Sesame: I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but these oysters were good. One came per person, so it was a nice bite. If you like oysters, I would recommend these. - Smoked Trout with Matsutake & Pork Belly Dashi: I really did not like this. Maybe it's the flavor of dashi that I was not a fan of. But it was a tiny portion of soup and I just didn't think it tasted very good. I've posted a video so you can see the hoopla that goes into presenting the soup to you. - Yogurt Batter-Yellowtail "Floss" Toast: I thought this was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this bite. It's topped with pork floss (I think) and radish. - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit: This is a bite where I was skeptical about the combination - but the mousse perfectly complimented the biscuit. Also, the mousse was quite good - reminded me of duck pate. - Garlic Bread with Burrata: I think behind the yellowtail "floss" toast, this was probably my favorite. It's not a super creative combination like some of the other dishes, but it was super tasty. - Grilled Shiitake with Kosho: I guess I didn't see what was so special about this dish. It was just a shiitake mushroom. I think there are better things on the menu to eat. - Pork Belly Citrus Salad: This salad was delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly. It was tender and had the perfect amount of fattiness on it. Everything in this salad came together really well. - Cast Iron Quail Eggs with Collards, Smoked Feta & Candied Pecan: I'm not a huge fan of quail eggs, but this was absolutely delicious. They fry the quail eggs in the cast iron pan and top it with all the other ingredients. - CA State Bird with Provisions: Everyone raves about this dish. I will explain where I'm coming from. I thought it was alright, but it was not the best fried bird I've ever tasted. I expected much more. I think the reason I felt this way is because I like my fried birds (this was quail) to be extremely flavorful. The brine and the coating both have to be bursting with flavor for me. The flavor in this dish just fell a little short for me. For what it's worth, everyone else at the table loved it! And I think you have to try this dish if you're a meat eater, because it's the name of the restaurant. - Kimchi & Maitake "Fried Rice" A La Plancha with Smoked Egg Bottarga: I really don't think this dish is worth the money. Certain things just don't make sense as something fancy, and kimchi fried rice is one of those dishes. It's one of those dishes where you go to the Asian Ghetto in Berkeley to get for less than $8 (or you make it at home), and it's a comfort food. I thought this was an attempt to make it a fancier dish, which fell short for me. Dessert: Chevre-Rosemary Ice Cream & Cherries & Old Fashioned Cake, candied buddha's hand, white chocolate crunch, ginger cream): This dessert had some good aspects, and some just ok aspects. Overall, I thought it was good. The cake itself wasn't super special (just tasted like chocolate cake), but that white chocolate crunch and candied buddha's hand made it really delicious. The ice cream with cherries was quite delicious!For a drink, I ended up getting the iced tea with yuzu syrup. It think it is meant to be light, but I think it ended up just tasting like something very watered down to me. It is refreshing though!
2/3 visits resulted in a successful meal. First time was no reservation - got put on the wait list and eventually gave up. Second time was from snagging a reservation off a cancellation. That was great - just show up and seats were ready. The third time was on a walking with the last free spot available. Yup, winner, winner, chicken dinner.  The place opens at 5:30 but you don't want to show up later than an hour before if you want to have some hopes of getting in.Almost everything served up here is delicious. Best thing were some chips with guac dip. Those were phenomenal. Bummed that those rotated out on the second visit. Eating at the chef's counter is a great experience. You can witness firsthand on the dishes as they are being put together. If you see anything's good, you can directly request an order. Also, do order the state bird provision from the menu. You'll be glad that you did.
We had a good time at State Bird Provisions, once we found our way inside! It's confusing when you pull up as there is no sign to indicate that you are in the right place. I found this to be a bit pretentious, but nonetheless with two months of preparation, I kept an open mind once the meal began.The food was very inventive to say the least; there are so many different ingredients in unique combinations that you have no idea what to expect when you take a bite. I made the mistake of snacking throughout the day, so I wasn't able to try everything, but we did order much more than we should have just to sample most of the menu. There are 10 dishes that circulate around the restaurant and that you can order on the fly, and there is a separate part of the menu that requires you to order in advance. Also, there are no cocktails here, which was disappointing. They do offer wine and several craft beers if that is any consolation.My favorite dish was the namesake, the CA state bird with provisions. It was crispy, incredibly flavorful, and just all-around delicious. The half portion was plenty for two of us. We also tried the grapefruit and hodo soy tofu salad with miso-chili dressing, and it was light, fruity, and refreshing. The individual dishes are hard to remember as they aren't printed on the menu, but the menu changes frequently anyways so I'll try to describe what I do remember with the help of the website. The hush puppies with slaw were very tasty, and I highly recommend the guinea hen dumpling with broth. I think the smoked trout-avocado "chip & dip" was what we had, and it was quite good as well. The toasts are very interesting and they showcase a surprising cast of ingredients, some of which I haven't even heard of. I recommend ordering two or more toasts and splitting them; you can get about two bites out of each. I tried an oyster and it had nice flavor, but I don't eat enough of them to know if it was well-done. The one dish that didn't stand out was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was too runny, and the bread itself didn't really taste of garlic. We finished off our meal with a margarita granita, which tasted just like a margarita made of shaved ice and had tapioca to add an interesting texture. We needed something light after stuffing ourselves silly, and this fit the bill nicely. I had high expectations going in as this restaurant was all over the food blogs and takes some serious planning to get a reservation. It didn't completely live up to the hype, but that may be due in part to me building it up so much rather than the experience itself. I had no problem getting a 7:15PM reservation on a Sunday, though I did wake up in the middle of the night on the first day they were taking reservations. There was no line at the restaurant itself the whole time we were there, so maybe word is getting around that there is no use in trying (it's a small space), or perhaps the hype is dying down? Overall, the food here was very unique and well-executed. I've had meal experiences I have enjoyed more (Liholiho Yacht Club and Foreign Cinema come to mind), but State Bird Provisions still makes it high on my list. Obviously, the gimmick factor (Californian food served dim sum-style) likely plays into a lot of the hype, but the food can certainly stand on its own.
I am madly in love. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I'm not sure really what I expected to be honest. The food is incredible and the concept is exciting! Carts of goodies being pushed around and offered table side is my new favorite thing ever. Customer service was perfect. The host sadly I'm forgetting his name, but he rocks! If you haven't tried this place, I would leave whatever restraining you're eating at now and go straight here. We didn't have a reservation because they were fully booked- I heard from friends there may be a long wait without one. When we arrived it was full be we only waited about 25 minutes. Not too shabby. I can't wait to come back. Everything was so delicious.
We came here for my birthday dinner, and it was pretty good. While most items were fine, there was one thing that stood out among the rest. The Spicy Pork Sausage Chawanmushi is probably the main reason why SBP gets 4 stars from me. It's like an elevated huevos con chorizo. Execution was on point. The pork was tender, and the eggs were silky smooth. It was also very well thought out. The sweet, smoky pork was well balanced with the pickly olives. Topped over the perfectly steamed eggs, the whole combination was full flavored and well rounded. I don't even feel like talking about everything else we ate because I'm just gonna say that it wasn't as good as the chawanmushi.
I came with three friends on a Sunday night and thankfully didn't have to wait on one of those notoriously long lines that I've read about.  (Might have been thanks, in part, to a local friend who get there before us; we were visiting from out of town).  The State Bird experience is pretty unique -- you can order off a traditional menu and also order off the dimsum-like carts that make their way from table to table.  We tried a number of dishes: the oysters, two different kinds of mini-pancakes, the duck liver mousse, and several more items.  Despite these delicious dishes, my favorite was seemingly the most simple item: the garlic bread with burrata.  The bread was warm, soft and chewy, and had a lovely garlic flavor that was perfectly complemented by the burrata.  For dessert, we ordered the black sesame angel food cake (with caramelized banana and ginger cream), which sounded super interesting on the menu.  Our server, in fact, told us it was her favorite dessert item.  It was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  No special flavor really stood out... the dessert seemed to lack personality.  Despite the disappointing dessert, I really enjoyed the State Bird experience and am glad we had a chance eat here during our short stay in San Francisco.
One of the best experiences I've had dining in SF. Definitely Michelin star worthy and well worth the two month wait, which is the earliest you can make reservations. As soon as the clock struck midnight, we reserved a table online for two months later. Dining experience: "Fancy dim sum" You have a menu you can order from and they also push around carts with other dishes you can choose from. All dishes are tapas style. We were four people and one dish was just enough for four people to have a taste.Service/ambiance: Outstanding service. Cute/casual atmosphere. Everyone was really friendly and attentive and not pretentious at all. You definitely do not have to dress up to eat here. Everyone was pretty casual, including the servers.Food: We were celebrating our birthdays so had no reservations and grabbed at whatever we thought sounded good. By the end we were extremely stuffed and it ended up being a total of 16 dishes. I won't review them all but the standouts were the Kimchi fried rice (menu) and pork belly (special). You also cannot leave without getting the best ice sandwiches in the world. They were also nice enough to put candles on the sandwiches and sing happy birthday!Also a nice surprise was that I was expecting to drop $100-200 for this meal but it ended up being about $65 per person. Perfect ending to a great meal.
The dining experience started great. Was sat at the chefs table and had a great view of the dishes that were about to be brought out. I passed on the first few, and was enjoying the tapas/dim sum style experience. However over time that eroded as I was continually bombarded with waiter after waiter trying to "sell" you a dish. It took away from the experience and became uncomfortable saying no and seeing the look on their faces. I think this could be an amazing place if they took a different approach and upped the level of service and professionalism. As for the food- it was good, but few dishes were great. The big standout to me was the Caesar asparagus- inventive and well done. Among the misses were the octopus- way too rubbery. I also had to try the State Bird. I can understand a lot of the complaints I read about it but to me, it was just your typical slightly above average fried chicken. Though at $15 for a half order, I think it was on the expensive side. I'd go back but with a different strategy - not care as much about the service and take my time to wait for the dishes I really want.
We were so underwhelmed by this place. No one in our party thought this place was a mind blowing 5 stars. We don't understand why it's so hard to book reservations and why ppl wait in line for hours?We came as a party of three (all first timers). State bird is GLORIFIED DIM SUM (but we all enjoy asian dim sum way more)!We order steak tartar: the steak was cut into small chunks that were chewy and not melt in your mouth nor was it flavorful.A fried pork w Apple compote: the pork was nice and crispy but could've used a touch more saltA pate mouse (?): serve with tiny corn bread the pate was crazy salty we took one bite stared at each otherA marinated tuna tataki: the tuna was a low quality, looked like it could've just been the standard skipjack tunaThe signature state bird: buttermilk fried quail. Anything fried is good so can't complain but I could for sure live w outServer all other dishes I don't care to remember... Like the pancake bites and artichoke toast (ehhh).The highlight of my meal were the oysters and those weren't even cooked. I could eat the whole plate!Service was great!
We waited 30 min for it to open and ... Totally worth the wait. Apparently there is no need to get there early for a Sunday dinner-- there were quite a few empty tables and was no line when we finished around 7:30. Love the food:Best: duck liver mousse, duck prosciutto pancake, oysterSo so: pork bellyI wanted to try the uni... Next time!

It was really nice because it was on the lighter side and they topped it out with this yummy ginger cream.I definitely need to come back to try more dessert, as we ended up devouring everything that passed by.
When my friend wants something for her birthday, I'm going to do my best to make it happen. Even if it means standing for 2 hours in the freezing cold wind and intermittent rain on a busy street in San Francisco in front of a restaurant with no name on its store front.  Yeah.It was a great adventure.  A once in a lifetime experience at a place where reservations are difficult to obtain. You can go standby like we did and be the first in line to make sure that you get in.  We sat at the counter where we were entertained by the chefs. It was so amazing! The food was so different and creative!  They serve small plates like dim sum style by walking around with trays of brilliant goodness such as Sourdough Garlic Bread with Burrata, special Dumplings, Pork Belly, Duck Liver Mousse with almond biscuits, and Potato croquet with Bay Shrimp in Garlic sauce. The servers will mark your bill with tic marks as if you're at a dim sum place. We also selected items from the printed menu: Hedgehog Mushroom Toast, Everything Buckwheat-Beef tongue pastrami pancake, Butternut Squash "mochi " with Brussel sprouts, savory oats and black truffle;  and California State Bird (quail). It was a fabulous and unique dinner. The service was excellent. ..they removed used plates and empty dishes promptly. We were able to order anything from any staff!  (Gabi is from Kaimuki, Hawaii!)  Mahalo!  I'll treasure this memory always!
One of my favorite restaurants in SF, and totally deserving of their Michelin star! I hate waiting in line, so both times I've gone I made a reservation online 60 days in advance. (However, they also have space for walk-in's provided you're willing to wait in line before it opens) The service is like dim sum: waiters bring around carts/trays of small plates and you pick what you'd like to try! (You can also order directly from the kitchen) It's great because you get to try a lot of different dishes and it's helpful to see the food beforehand.My hands-down favorite dish here is the pork belly citrus salad. The pork belly is unbelievably crisp and juicy, and the citrus and herbs add a nice freshness to counterbalance the fattiness of the meat. Other classic favorites include the garlic bread with burrata, and the chips and seafood dip. And for dessert, their ice cream sandwich is whimsical and tasty! I've enjoyed almost everything I've ordered here, so just choose what appeals to you and you really can't go wrong!
Stayed up until midnight in front of the computer and I still couldn't get a table for 2 on a Saturday evening. I ended up reserving a table for 4 at 9:30 on April 2. It was well worth the fight. My SO is still raving about it, asking over and over if we can go again.What we ordered :(***= what I liked most)- Duck liver mouse with almond biscuits**- Chawanmushi*- State bird with provisions***- Chips with smoked salmon dip- Seeded Avocado***- Pork belly citrus salad***- Garlic bread with burrata- Potato Fritter with bay shrimp**- Steak Tartare- Oysters- Red trout***- Kung pao sweetbreads- Grilled octopus- Ice cream sandwich ***- CevicheThe Avocado was so simple and delicious. It may not look like much but it was just the thing we needed halfway through all the proteins. The Pork Belly melted in your mouth and paired perfectly with the citrus. The Garlic Bread was not as great as I hoped it would be, it was just fried dough and was difficult to pull apart. I am hoping to come back in the near future to try other commandables. Fingers crossed that I can get a reservation!
4 star for the experience but 3 stars for the food. American Dim sum is what I call it. Was the food exceptionally great, no, not really. Did 1 of the 10 dishes really stand out that I felt wowed. No. I felt that each dish I had... I know I had it better somewhere else. Maybe they need 1 signature dish.  My thoughts were that all that they served, my beau's mom makes better and didn't charge us an arm and a leg.I suggest going because it is an experience and you can cross it off your list of restaurants to go to. Maybe because of the hype, I expected more but overall, I know my beau left hungry. And he doesn't eat all that much. It is on the pricier side like any tapas place.
After an extremely long wait for a reservation, we enter and are greeted by....no one. We wait in a crowded area for a while until a host appears but doesn't acknowledge us. Finally, he checks us in and says our table isn't ready. He can take our drink order. Several other parties are wondering what to do too. After another wait, we give him our drink order and he corrects the pronunciation of a beer. Gee thanks. He ends up not getting us the drinks and we have to re-order them.This first experience put a damper on the whole meal for us. Don't get swept up in the hype. There are plenty of other restaurants of the same calibre, so I won't be back.It's also extremely loud so I couldn't hear most of the servers well.
Reservations: Booked a table for 2 at 7:00pm on a Tuesday evening two months in advance. Reservations open up 2 months in advance at midnight. For people who don't enjoy waiting for a table, I'd recommend going this route. We were seated promptly upon entry.Food: Dim-sum style plus a menu for specific dishes and desserts. We really couldn't have gone wrong here. I would order every dish that I had that evening again. That being said, there was definitely favorites versus good dishes. Here's my list--3/1/2016 Must Order (dishes in order of deliciousness):-CA state provisions bird-Sesame encrusted avocado-Ice cream sandwich (half portions available)-Albacore white floss on toast-Seafood salsa with nori on top-Guinea hen dumpling with broth-Panna cotta w apricot and a cardamon crisp-Hog island oysters-Blood orange lamb sausage-Duck liver mousse with corn bread-Steak tartare with uni and a rice crisp (rosemary flavor was off putting)Total: ~$130 for two people
I quite enjoyed the food here. I do think this place suffers a little bit from the trendiness making it cooler to people than it actually is - but most of the food is quite good. I don't know why people call this place dim sum style, see, dim sum is supposed to be cheap. When you go to dim sum, it usually costs $20 per person and you're so full you're about to burst. So let's call it what it is...expensive tapas, not dim sum!I came here with a group of people, a big enough party that we all got the prix fixe menu. This was great because we got to try everything on the menu for that day. It seems the menu changes all the time, so I'll break down the highlights of what we had and what I thought: (bear with me, this will be a long review but will hopefully help you narrow down what you want to eat if they're serving the same things at the particular time you're there). Note that we had more things than I listed, but I didn't find certain of them to be super notable - e.g. we had a lamb dish, a tofu & kiwi salad dish, a persimmon dish, and a red trout dish. These were all good, but I didn't find them to be very special. - Hog Island Oyster, Spicy Kohirabi Kraut & Sesame: I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but these oysters were good. One came per person, so it was a nice bite. If you like oysters, I would recommend these. - Smoked Trout with Matsutake & Pork Belly Dashi: I really did not like this. Maybe it's the flavor of dashi that I was not a fan of. But it was a tiny portion of soup and I just didn't think it tasted very good. I've posted a video so you can see the hoopla that goes into presenting the soup to you. - Yogurt Batter-Yellowtail "Floss" Toast: I thought this was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this bite. It's topped with pork floss (I think) and radish. - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit: This is a bite where I was skeptical about the combination - but the mousse perfectly complimented the biscuit. Also, the mousse was quite good - reminded me of duck pate. - Garlic Bread with Burrata: I think behind the yellowtail "floss" toast, this was probably my favorite. It's not a super creative combination like some of the other dishes, but it was super tasty. - Grilled Shiitake with Kosho: I guess I didn't see what was so special about this dish. It was just a shiitake mushroom. I think there are better things on the menu to eat. - Pork Belly Citrus Salad: This salad was delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly. It was tender and had the perfect amount of fattiness on it. Everything in this salad came together really well. - Cast Iron Quail Eggs with Collards, Smoked Feta & Candied Pecan: I'm not a huge fan of quail eggs, but this was absolutely delicious. They fry the quail eggs in the cast iron pan and top it with all the other ingredients. - CA State Bird with Provisions: Everyone raves about this dish. I will explain where I'm coming from. I thought it was alright, but it was not the best fried bird I've ever tasted. I expected much more. I think the reason I felt this way is because I like my fried birds (this was quail) to be extremely flavorful. The brine and the coating both have to be bursting with flavor for me. The flavor in this dish just fell a little short for me. For what it's worth, everyone else at the table loved it! And I think you have to try this dish if you're a meat eater, because it's the name of the restaurant. - Kimchi & Maitake "Fried Rice" A La Plancha with Smoked Egg Bottarga: I really don't think this dish is worth the money. Certain things just don't make sense as something fancy, and kimchi fried rice is one of those dishes. It's one of those dishes where you go to the Asian Ghetto in Berkeley to get for less than $8 (or you make it at home), and it's a comfort food. I thought this was an attempt to make it a fancier dish, which fell short for me. Dessert: Chevre-Rosemary Ice Cream & Cherries & Old Fashioned Cake, candied buddha's hand, white chocolate crunch, ginger cream): This dessert had some good aspects, and some just ok aspects. Overall, I thought it was good. The cake itself wasn't super special (just tasted like chocolate cake), but that white chocolate crunch and candied buddha's hand made it really delicious. The ice cream with cherries was quite delicious!For a drink, I ended up getting the iced tea with yuzu syrup. It think it is meant to be light, but I think it ended up just tasting like something very watered down to me. It is refreshing though!
2/3 visits resulted in a successful meal. First time was no reservation - got put on the wait list and eventually gave up. Second time was from snagging a reservation off a cancellation. That was great - just show up and seats were ready. The third time was on a walking with the last free spot available. Yup, winner, winner, chicken dinner.  The place opens at 5:30 but you don't want to show up later than an hour before if you want to have some hopes of getting in.Almost everything served up here is delicious. Best thing were some chips with guac dip. Those were phenomenal. Bummed that those rotated out on the second visit. Eating at the chef's counter is a great experience. You can witness firsthand on the dishes as they are being put together. If you see anything's good, you can directly request an order. Also, do order the state bird provision from the menu. You'll be glad that you did.
We had a good time at State Bird Provisions, once we found our way inside! It's confusing when you pull up as there is no sign to indicate that you are in the right place. I found this to be a bit pretentious, but nonetheless with two months of preparation, I kept an open mind once the meal began.The food was very inventive to say the least; there are so many different ingredients in unique combinations that you have no idea what to expect when you take a bite. I made the mistake of snacking throughout the day, so I wasn't able to try everything, but we did order much more than we should have just to sample most of the menu. There are 10 dishes that circulate around the restaurant and that you can order on the fly, and there is a separate part of the menu that requires you to order in advance. Also, there are no cocktails here, which was disappointing. They do offer wine and several craft beers if that is any consolation.My favorite dish was the namesake, the CA state bird with provisions. It was crispy, incredibly flavorful, and just all-around delicious. The half portion was plenty for two of us. We also tried the grapefruit and hodo soy tofu salad with miso-chili dressing, and it was light, fruity, and refreshing. The individual dishes are hard to remember as they aren't printed on the menu, but the menu changes frequently anyways so I'll try to describe what I do remember with the help of the website. The hush puppies with slaw were very tasty, and I highly recommend the guinea hen dumpling with broth. I think the smoked trout-avocado "chip & dip" was what we had, and it was quite good as well. The toasts are very interesting and they showcase a surprising cast of ingredients, some of which I haven't even heard of. I recommend ordering two or more toasts and splitting them; you can get about two bites out of each. I tried an oyster and it had nice flavor, but I don't eat enough of them to know if it was well-done. The one dish that didn't stand out was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was too runny, and the bread itself didn't really taste of garlic. We finished off our meal with a margarita granita, which tasted just like a margarita made of shaved ice and had tapioca to add an interesting texture. We needed something light after stuffing ourselves silly, and this fit the bill nicely. I had high expectations going in as this restaurant was all over the food blogs and takes some serious planning to get a reservation. It didn't completely live up to the hype, but that may be due in part to me building it up so much rather than the experience itself. I had no problem getting a 7:15PM reservation on a Sunday, though I did wake up in the middle of the night on the first day they were taking reservations. There was no line at the restaurant itself the whole time we were there, so maybe word is getting around that there is no use in trying (it's a small space), or perhaps the hype is dying down? Overall, the food here was very unique and well-executed. I've had meal experiences I have enjoyed more (Liholiho Yacht Club and Foreign Cinema come to mind), but State Bird Provisions still makes it high on my list. Obviously, the gimmick factor (Californian food served dim sum-style) likely plays into a lot of the hype, but the food can certainly stand on its own.
I am madly in love. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I'm not sure really what I expected to be honest. The food is incredible and the concept is exciting! Carts of goodies being pushed around and offered table side is my new favorite thing ever. Customer service was perfect. The host sadly I'm forgetting his name, but he rocks! If you haven't tried this place, I would leave whatever restraining you're eating at now and go straight here. We didn't have a reservation because they were fully booked- I heard from friends there may be a long wait without one. When we arrived it was full be we only waited about 25 minutes. Not too shabby. I can't wait to come back. Everything was so delicious.
We came here for my birthday dinner, and it was pretty good. While most items were fine, there was one thing that stood out among the rest. The Spicy Pork Sausage Chawanmushi is probably the main reason why SBP gets 4 stars from me. It's like an elevated huevos con chorizo. Execution was on point. The pork was tender, and the eggs were silky smooth. It was also very well thought out. The sweet, smoky pork was well balanced with the pickly olives. Topped over the perfectly steamed eggs, the whole combination was full flavored and well rounded. I don't even feel like talking about everything else we ate because I'm just gonna say that it wasn't as good as the chawanmushi.
I came with three friends on a Sunday night and thankfully didn't have to wait on one of those notoriously long lines that I've read about.  (Might have been thanks, in part, to a local friend who get there before us; we were visiting from out of town).  The State Bird experience is pretty unique -- you can order off a traditional menu and also order off the dimsum-like carts that make their way from table to table.  We tried a number of dishes: the oysters, two different kinds of mini-pancakes, the duck liver mousse, and several more items.  Despite these delicious dishes, my favorite was seemingly the most simple item: the garlic bread with burrata.  The bread was warm, soft and chewy, and had a lovely garlic flavor that was perfectly complemented by the burrata.  For dessert, we ordered the black sesame angel food cake (with caramelized banana and ginger cream), which sounded super interesting on the menu.  Our server, in fact, told us it was her favorite dessert item.  It was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  No special flavor really stood out... the dessert seemed to lack personality.  Despite the disappointing dessert, I really enjoyed the State Bird experience and am glad we had a chance eat here during our short stay in San Francisco.
One of the best experiences I've had dining in SF. Definitely Michelin star worthy and well worth the two month wait, which is the earliest you can make reservations. As soon as the clock struck midnight, we reserved a table online for two months later. Dining experience: "Fancy dim sum" You have a menu you can order from and they also push around carts with other dishes you can choose from. All dishes are tapas style. We were four people and one dish was just enough for four people to have a taste.Service/ambiance: Outstanding service. Cute/casual atmosphere. Everyone was really friendly and attentive and not pretentious at all. You definitely do not have to dress up to eat here. Everyone was pretty casual, including the servers.Food: We were celebrating our birthdays so had no reservations and grabbed at whatever we thought sounded good. By the end we were extremely stuffed and it ended up being a total of 16 dishes. I won't review them all but the standouts were the Kimchi fried rice (menu) and pork belly (special). You also cannot leave without getting the best ice sandwiches in the world. They were also nice enough to put candles on the sandwiches and sing happy birthday!Also a nice surprise was that I was expecting to drop $100-200 for this meal but it ended up being about $65 per person. Perfect ending to a great meal.
The dining experience started great. Was sat at the chefs table and had a great view of the dishes that were about to be brought out. I passed on the first few, and was enjoying the tapas/dim sum style experience. However over time that eroded as I was continually bombarded with waiter after waiter trying to "sell" you a dish. It took away from the experience and became uncomfortable saying no and seeing the look on their faces. I think this could be an amazing place if they took a different approach and upped the level of service and professionalism. As for the food- it was good, but few dishes were great. The big standout to me was the Caesar asparagus- inventive and well done. Among the misses were the octopus- way too rubbery. I also had to try the State Bird. I can understand a lot of the complaints I read about it but to me, it was just your typical slightly above average fried chicken. Though at $15 for a half order, I think it was on the expensive side. I'd go back but with a different strategy - not care as much about the service and take my time to wait for the dishes I really want.
We were so underwhelmed by this place. No one in our party thought this place was a mind blowing 5 stars. We don't understand why it's so hard to book reservations and why ppl wait in line for hours?We came as a party of three (all first timers). State bird is GLORIFIED DIM SUM (but we all enjoy asian dim sum way more)!We order steak tartar: the steak was cut into small chunks that were chewy and not melt in your mouth nor was it flavorful.A fried pork w Apple compote: the pork was nice and crispy but could've used a touch more saltA pate mouse (?): serve with tiny corn bread the pate was crazy salty we took one bite stared at each otherA marinated tuna tataki: the tuna was a low quality, looked like it could've just been the standard skipjack tunaThe signature state bird: buttermilk fried quail. Anything fried is good so can't complain but I could for sure live w outServer all other dishes I don't care to remember... Like the pancake bites and artichoke toast (ehhh).The highlight of my meal were the oysters and those weren't even cooked. I could eat the whole plate!Service was great!
We waited 30 min for it to open and ... Totally worth the wait. Apparently there is no need to get there early for a Sunday dinner-- there were quite a few empty tables and was no line when we finished around 7:30. Love the food:Best: duck liver mousse, duck prosciutto pancake, oysterSo so: pork bellyI wanted to try the uni... Next time!
Fast forward 3 years later....5 Stars - Must orderQuail - simply an outstanding dishHalibut Spring Roll - clean bold flavors Yogurt Butter-Swordfish Floss Toast - melt in your mouth goodnessBrokaw Avocado - highlights the avocado in the best way possible and textures are amazing Horchata Ice Cream Sandwich - the only complaint is I wish I had more of those delicious strawberries and stronger horchata flavor but honestly, even without that, it was still sensational4 Stars - great but would have been better with tweaksChawanmushi - egg base was silky smooth and packed with flavor but spicy sausage and olive flavors clashed + felt the parmesan cracker added little value to the dishPork Belly Citrus Salad - pork was a tad dried out but other than that, the burst of citrus combined with the heat notes and umami fish sauce came together well Potato Fritter with Bay Shrimp - fritter was delicious and shrimp was cooked well but would have liked less of the ranch sauce (very "mayo" forward) Guinea Hen Dumpling - broth was super intricate and refreshing, dumpling was filled well and worked in harmony with the broth Potato and Shellfish Porridge - eat it with a spoon and you'll find that it taste like a deconstructed clam chowder in the best way possible, a tad on the salty side but well done Beef Tongue Pancake - good grief was this tender, all it needed was a pinch more salt or a sauce to add some moisture to the pancake 3 Stars - middle of the pack, not a must have but not a bad choiceLap cheong - a very nice pepper note that lingers, a good fresh interpretation of chinese sausage Grilled Squid and Ink Noodle - Noodles had an interesting chewy quality but didn't pick up much ink essence and wasn't enough squid, that aside, dashi was goodSteak Tartare - not sure what the purpose was with the uni, that aside the steak quality was superb and seasoned well but would have liked a dash of more salt Duck liver Mousse - very rich and indulgent, what you would expect 2 Stars - fine but nothing specialHog Island Oyster - fresh, but the toppings didn't bring out the oyster Artichoke Butter Bean Toast - highlights the ingredients well but was flat after the first biteCroque Madame - not enough ham, flavors felt lost and underwhelming Lime Granita - far too acidic, didn't get any essence of avocado milk and thought the gelee only further compounded the sourness 1 Star - would not order, waste of funds/caloriesGarlic Bread with Burrata - dough was dry and lacked butter/garlic flavors, burrata was merely there for show Grilled Shiitake - this dish still baffles me, I think I must be missing something...Pistachio Date Turnover - desperately needed sweetness, crust was dry and flavorless Service was friendly and efficient Only beer and wine (try the bret golden ale, best draft they have) Overall ThoughtsIs State Bird hipster dim sum? Sure. Does it get expensive to eat all the things? Yup.Are there disappointing moments? Yes, just like any other restaurant Is it worth the trip? You betcha! =)
Definitely an innovative restaurant worth trying if you can get a reservation. It won't break the bank relative to other Michelin high end establishment but just cause it's decent value it isn't going to be big portions.Everything was very flavorful and well seasoned. Nothing bland.The signature quail (4/5) - very tender. Most actually solid meat the whole nightSmoked fish dip (5/5) - very flavorful and great texture with the chipsFried rice (3/5) - basically kimchi fried rice but with some local greensSteak tartare (3/5) - an innovative take as it is served with a crisp. Probably still not the best steak tartare I've hadGarlic bread with burrata (3/5) - found it to be a greasy knot with some okay burrata on topCarrot Mochi (5/5) - unique to say the least!Ice cream sandwich (5/5) - very well balanced and solid dessertService was great, friendly and with food surrounding you, very fast!
Finally got to try this place after trying to get a reservation for months! Luckily one day I was on opentable and got a reservation at 845pm. This has been one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation! With that said, I was expecting mind blowing food, but it wasn't anything like that. My boyfriend and I came here for date night. We tried many dishes, there were more "just ok" dishes than excellent dishes. Our top favorites were the ca state bird, oolong ice cream sandwiches, mushroom toast and crispy pork belly. The state bird was so crispy and flavorful, usually I hate quail cause it tastes strange but this made me thoroughly enjoy it. The mushroom toast was super flavorful, I'm not sure what they used to marinate those mushrooms but it was so tasty! The oolong ice cream  was amazing, it had a good flavor and it wasn't too sweet! I could have eaten it all by myself but sadly I had to share with my boyfriend. We also had a few other dishes that weren't really good. We tried steak tartare, it was different from what we usually have. They had thick fat chunks instead of small, minced like texture. It was flavorless and bland. The butternut squash Mochi was a bit greasy and a little bland as well, we did not really enjoy these dishes. The final fish that wasn't great was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was tasty but the dough for the garlic bread was greasy and did not have any garlic flavor, it was a bit disappointing. I guess I should have listened to previous yelpers opinions. Overall, this place did not live up to the hype. It was ok but since their menu always changes I wouldn't mind going again to try some of their new dishes.Total for 2: $120
It took 3 years to get here. My friend and I would check for reservations every quarter and it was always always booked. One miracle day, she messages me and says, 'I finally got a reservation!' I thought she was joking at first, and fast forward 2-3 months later, we were sitting there on a Tuesday night. There's so much hype about this place that I was scared of being disappointed. But majority of the dishes were extremely well thought out and tasted delicious. We shared about 16 dishes... That's a lot, there were 3 people in our party and we were so stuffed! Our favorites: dumpling in broth, this was so tasty and the meat flavors with the broth went very well together. Fried pork snack with Apple compote; really nice texture. The signature state bird, has such a nice crunch. I also enjoyed the steak tartar, it was light and delectable. After eating 15 savory dishes, we hardly had any room for dessert. We did manage to try half of an angel cake. It was really nice because it was on the lighter side and they topped it out with this yummy ginger cream.I definitely need to come back to try more dessert, as we ended up devouring everything that passed by.
When my friend wants something for her birthday, I'm going to do my best to make it happen. Even if it means standing for 2 hours in the freezing cold wind and intermittent rain on a busy street in San Francisco in front of a restaurant with no name on its store front.  Yeah.It was a great adventure.  A once in a lifetime experience at a place where reservations are difficult to obtain.

The servers will mark your bill with tic marks as if you're at a dim sum place. We also selected items from the printed menu: Hedgehog Mushroom Toast, Everything Buckwheat-Beef tongue pastrami pancake, Butternut Squash "mochi " with Brussel sprouts, savory oats and black truffle;  and California State Bird (quail). It was a fabulous and unique dinner. The service was excellent. ..they removed used plates and empty dishes promptly.

I quite enjoyed the food here. I do think this place suffers a little bit from the trendiness making it cooler to people than it actually is - but most of the food is quite good. I don't know why people call this place dim sum style, see, dim sum is supposed to be cheap. When you go to dim sum, it usually costs $20 per person and you're so full you're about to burst. So let's call it what it is...expensive tapas, not dim sum!I came here with a group of people, a big enough party that we all got the prix fixe menu. This was great because we got to try everything on the menu for that day. It seems the menu changes all the time, so I'll break down the highlights of what we had and what I thought: (bear with me, this will be a long review but will hopefully help you narrow down what you want to eat if they're serving the same things at the particular time you're there). Note that we had more things than I listed, but I didn't find certain of them to be super notable - e.g. we had a lamb dish, a tofu & kiwi salad dish, a persimmon dish, and a red trout dish. These were all good, but I didn't find them to be very special. - Hog Island Oyster, Spicy Kohirabi Kraut & Sesame: I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but these oysters were good. One came per person, so it was a nice bite. If you like oysters, I would recommend these. - Smoked Trout with Matsutake & Pork Belly Dashi: I really did not like this. Maybe it's the flavor of dashi that I was not a fan of. But it was a tiny portion of soup and I just didn't think it tasted very good. I've posted a video so you can see the hoopla that goes into presenting the soup to you. - Yogurt Batter-Yellowtail "Floss" Toast: I thought this was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this bite. It's topped with pork floss (I think) and radish. - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit: This is a bite where I was skeptical about the combination - but the mousse perfectly complimented the biscuit. Also, the mousse was quite good - reminded me of duck pate. - Garlic Bread with Burrata: I think behind the yellowtail "floss" toast, this was probably my favorite. It's not a super creative combination like some of the other dishes, but it was super tasty. - Grilled Shiitake with Kosho: I guess I didn't see what was so special about this dish. It was just a shiitake mushroom. I think there are better things on the menu to eat. - Pork Belly Citrus Salad: This salad was delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly. It was tender and had the perfect amount of fattiness on it. Everything in this salad came together really well. - Cast Iron Quail Eggs with Collards, Smoked Feta & Candied Pecan: I'm not a huge fan of quail eggs, but this was absolutely delicious. They fry the quail eggs in the cast iron pan and top it with all the other ingredients. - CA State Bird with Provisions: Everyone raves about this dish. I will explain where I'm coming from. I thought it was alright, but it was not the best fried bird I've ever tasted. I expected much more. I think the reason I felt this way is because I like my fried birds (this was quail) to be extremely flavorful. The brine and the coating both have to be bursting with flavor for me. The flavor in this dish just fell a little short for me. For what it's worth, everyone else at the table loved it! And I think you have to try this dish if you're a meat eater, because it's the name of the restaurant. - Kimchi & Maitake "Fried Rice" A La Plancha with Smoked Egg Bottarga: I really don't think this dish is worth the money. Certain things just don't make sense as something fancy, and kimchi fried rice is one of those dishes. It's one of those dishes where you go to the Asian Ghetto in Berkeley to get for less than $8 (or you make it at home), and it's a comfort food. I thought this was an attempt to make it a fancier dish, which fell short for me. Dessert: Chevre-Rosemary Ice Cream & Cherries & Old Fashioned Cake, candied buddha's hand, white chocolate crunch, ginger cream): This dessert had some good aspects, and some just ok aspects. Overall, I thought it was good. The cake itself wasn't super special (just tasted like chocolate cake), but that white chocolate crunch and candied buddha's hand made it really delicious. The ice cream with cherries was quite delicious!For a drink, I ended up getting the iced tea with yuzu syrup. It think it is meant to be light, but I think it ended up just tasting like something very watered down to me. It is refreshing though!
2/3 visits resulted in a successful meal. First time was no reservation - got put on the wait list and eventually gave up. Second time was from snagging a reservation off a cancellation. That was great - just show up and seats were ready. The third time was on a walking with the last free spot available. Yup, winner, winner, chicken dinner.  The place opens at 5:30 but you don't want to show up later than an hour before if you want to have some hopes of getting in.Almost everything served up here is delicious. Best thing were some chips with guac dip. Those were phenomenal. Bummed that those rotated out on the second visit. Eating at the chef's counter is a great experience. You can witness firsthand on the dishes as they are being put together. If you see anything's good, you can directly request an order. Also, do order the state bird provision from the menu. You'll be glad that you did.
We had a good time at State Bird Provisions, once we found our way inside! It's confusing when you pull up as there is no sign to indicate that you are in the right place. I found this to be a bit pretentious, but nonetheless with two months of preparation, I kept an open mind once the meal began.The food was very inventive to say the least; there are so many different ingredients in unique combinations that you have no idea what to expect when you take a bite. I made the mistake of snacking throughout the day, so I wasn't able to try everything, but we did order much more than we should have just to sample most of the menu. There are 10 dishes that circulate around the restaurant and that you can order on the fly, and there is a separate part of the menu that requires you to order in advance. Also, there are no cocktails here, which was disappointing. They do offer wine and several craft beers if that is any consolation.My favorite dish was the namesake, the CA state bird with provisions. It was crispy, incredibly flavorful, and just all-around delicious. The half portion was plenty for two of us. We also tried the grapefruit and hodo soy tofu salad with miso-chili dressing, and it was light, fruity, and refreshing. The individual dishes are hard to remember as they aren't printed on the menu, but the menu changes frequently anyways so I'll try to describe what I do remember with the help of the website. The hush puppies with slaw were very tasty, and I highly recommend the guinea hen dumpling with broth. I think the smoked trout-avocado "chip & dip" was what we had, and it was quite good as well. The toasts are very interesting and they showcase a surprising cast of ingredients, some of which I haven't even heard of. I recommend ordering two or more toasts and splitting them; you can get about two bites out of each. I tried an oyster and it had nice flavor, but I don't eat enough of them to know if it was well-done. The one dish that didn't stand out was the garlic bread with burrata. The burrata was too runny, and the bread itself didn't really taste of garlic. We finished off our meal with a margarita granita, which tasted just like a margarita made of shaved ice and had tapioca to add an interesting texture. We needed something light after stuffing ourselves silly, and this fit the bill nicely. I had high expectations going in as this restaurant was all over the food blogs and takes some serious planning to get a reservation. It didn't completely live up to the hype, but that may be due in part to me building it up so much rather than the experience itself. I had no problem getting a 7:15PM reservation on a Sunday, though I did wake up in the middle of the night on the first day they were taking reservations. There was no line at the restaurant itself the whole time we were there, so maybe word is getting around that there is no use in trying (it's a small space), or perhaps the hype is dying down? Overall, the food here was very unique and well-executed. I've had meal experiences I have enjoyed more (Liholiho Yacht Club and Foreign Cinema come to mind), but State Bird Provisions still makes it high on my list. Obviously, the gimmick factor (Californian food served dim sum-style) likely plays into a lot of the hype, but the food can certainly stand on its own.
