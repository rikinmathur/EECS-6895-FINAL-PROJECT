Two words: Dorito. Taco.It is everything I've dreamed of and more. An explosion of flavor in every bite, this little thing will NOT disappoint. It is a Mexican fast-food ecstacy in the shape of a taco. I dare you to have one and not succumb to the surreal state of euphoria. Nothing short of mouth orgasms will result in consuming the Holy Grail of tacos.You have been warned.The Famous Bowl is pretty cool too I guess...
This location is consistently the worst Taco Bell I've EVER been to.  I'm nearly 50 years old and I've been going to Taco Bell since I was a kid in 1974.  So believe me!  I know what Taco Bell food and quality should taste like.  I've patronized this Taco Bell from time to time for the last 8 years.  Always hoping that it will improve and it's always the absolute worst.  In fact, I've reported them to corporate before for their terrible food.  The beans in the burritos and tostadas are always dry and hard.  Everything is tasteless and poorly made.  It's like corporate has never come and given training on how to make anything!!  Tortillas aren't folded right.  Cheese is not placed on the food in correct amount, just everything.  And to make matters worse.  This store, along with several others in San Francisco is owned, as a Franchise, by the same man. A man who seems to like nickel and diming his customers.  No other Taco Bell anywhere will charge you for extra red sauce.  But he does!  At all of his locations.  Asking for extra red sauce is not asking for something that does't already come on the item.  It's just asking for a little more.  Think about it.  All you want them to do is to tilt the ladle a little longer while they wave it paste your burrito and they want to charge you a quarter for that.  It may only be 25 cents.  But it's the principle of how cheap and tacky they are for this.
Bad service. I was there at 10:10 on a Sunday morning. They were supposed to open at 10:00. Stood there for five minutes while someone inside kept looking up at me. If they were not going to open at least let me know.
The employees are either really awesome or kind of rude, it depends on who's working (this shouldn't be the case, but it's a fast food place, so). The only thing that really bugs me is that it's never that clean in this restaurant; tables are dirty, there are often gnats flying around, just stuff like that. Maybe this restaurant is understaffed (it sure seems like it based on how rushed you feel when you're here), but it still shouldn't be the case.
The Taco Bell is good here, but the KFC chicken too salty, pot pie too much seasoning. Mac n cheese tasted horrible, just come here for Taco Bell, Irving for KFC
If you're looking for authentic Kentucky Fried Chicken or Mexican Tacos Bells, this is NOT the PLACE! I can assure you that this will satisfy your belly (and your wallet!) but if you want to truly enjoy your experience in eating a food, look elsewhare! The chicken was kind of dry, the "ground beef" was oily as heck! And the tortillas were not farm fresh! I will return because I love mediocre fast food, and don't get me started on those cheesy Gordita Crunches. Anyway my name is Caitlyn and i'm an alcoholic,
So I actually like Taco Bell. Yeah, it's fast food and all, but every now and then I get a TB craving and it's over.I recently moved to within about a 5 minute walk of this place. I was actually a little apprehensive since I thought I'd be there all the time and gain about 20 lbs. But this Taco Bell is TERRIBLE.The beans are thick and dry and taste like crap. The nacho cheese sauce tastes off. Everything is just smushed into your tortilla. I've only been twice since I moved here, and even when I really want Taco Bell I don't go here. I've  never had the chicken, but based on the taco offerings, methinks that they can't be any good either.
Literally the worst Taco Bell ever, and my expectations were already very low. My food took forever and was cold, they got my order wrong, the restaurant was filthy... Come on! One would think that they would have mastered a bean burrito by now.
It's a Taco Bell combined with KFC. You don't need a Yelp review to tell you how it's going to be.The reason I'm writing this review is to say that the customer service team's manner runs the gamut from rude and obnoxious to ineffectual and servile. Paulette frequently yells at her employees and can make a further unpleasant dining experience if you're hoping to have a quiet time, and frequently rushes your order. Some people seem to love her, many others seem to agree that she's obnoxious. As I write this review I find that this is the only time it's been quiet and approaching pleasant since I started visiting 3 months ago.I live around the corner from it so I will come here occasionally out of convenience and maybe Stockholm Syndrome for quiet moments like this. NO INDOOR VOICE. This might just seem nitpicky to some, but I work in the food industry and I hold my dining experiences to higher standards; fast food is not an excuse for abysmal customer service and atmosphere.  Two stars because it's nearby and convenient.
Not much has changed since last review. I have to say...I don't know if management (not ownership) has changed. This location is consistently dirty. There is always food on the floors, crumbs everywhere, wrappers here and there. While I believe people should clean up after themselves unfortunately they don't. The staff here needs to keep a better eye on these things and clean up the tables they have.They alse still have trouble keeping the cooked chicken "inventory" ready. They regularly don't have pieces ready and are always asking if people want to wait while they cook more.
Friendly staff, good service and clean facility. Overall, good experience here!Parking: STREET PARKING ONLYBE PREPARED TO HAVE SPARE COINS ON YOU, SOME SPOTS AROUND THE AREA MAYBE EQUIPPED WITH PARKING METERS.You can come here on MUNI Metro L-Taraval as well!If you start feeling hungry while completing homework assignments or studying for midterm/final, then KFC/Taco Bell is right across the street from Parkside Branch Library.Brief update for 7/2/2013:The staff members here are nice and friendly, service is efficient so I'll be back when I crave for the fast feed. I was very tempted to get a sweet treat to satisfy my sweet tooth. The cookies they have on display looked very delicious so I bought 3 chocolate chip cookies for $1.39.
I walk in and I'm greeted by a fly buzzing around my face. I swat it away and I go to the counter to order. The food is good- pretty much a standard taco bell joint. The tables look clean and it doesn't smell. GOOD. Its really funny tho as I people-watch bc there are flies flying around them as they eat their food. Hahaha. Good thing I'm sitting on the side...no flies here. I kinda didn't like how the cashier was like, what kind of dessert would you like with your order. I was like cool,  "it comes with dessert?" To which she responds, "no, it does not." ????? I wonder if this ever works on other customers. Hopefully not! Probably will not be coming here again. Bleh.
It is funny when walking into this Kentucky Fried Chicken/ Taco Bell and making ones order. There is a sign encourage people to go online and tell them how one's service was. When they know their service sucks, they don't bother even giving the receipt. So even they know when they are an ass. Most of the staff is pretty good, there are just a couple, but unfortunately the couple work in the front end.
4 stars for the dorito taco supreme!! Wow!! I love doritos dipped in sour cream so this was kind of like heaven for me. Eating too many would probably bring me to heaven too. I just had one to try but I keep thinking about it. The lady working there was crazy super friendly, hey good to know she loves her job!!
Once upon a time, I got the 2 chalupas and a taco, and I went on home merrily with my food. Oh boy, was I excited to eat! I loved chalupas :) so I got home, and I ate all my food.One or two hours later, I started getting stomach cramps. Then it started making the gurgling noises. Then I ran to the bathroom.The end.
The dining area is tiny, but the service is always good and my food comes out quick.
omg these people are so nice..the lady at the register is a sweetheart...fast food and nice people
If you avoid the Lincoln HS crowd, 5 stars. Because Paulette gives you the best sassy service ever. She'll throw in an extra few extra strips for your wait. And she will ask you what sauce you want and how many. She is the bomb. Four stars only because Paulette isn't always there.
I grew up with Taco Bell (though my parents never took me there, I went with friends afterschool) and I still get the occasional desire to think outside the bun.  Something about the taste of the Meximelt makes me feel like a teenager again.  I was genuinely excited that they finally brought back the low fat menu items and that they introduced the Volcano Taco.   The low fat fresco menu consists of 9 items and they provide calorie and fat content information on the sign and their website.  Nothing has over 8 grams of fat.  There aren't that many chicken options and they have too many crunchy tacos.  * Volcano taco ($1.09) - the red taco shell was crispy and spicy but also tasted stale.  The filling tastes the same as the usual Taco Bell taco though it's supposed to have a special sauce.* Ranchero chicken soft taco, fresco style ($2.45) - very salty and sour with dry chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and fiesta salsa.  I didn't like it because of the sour fiesta salsa, I think.  I should stick with the Meximelt or try another location.  I have been to enough locations to believe that they aren't all the same.  The food is better at some locations.The service was very perky and upbeat.  Surprisingly so.  The dining room looked like it hadn't been cleaned for awhile though.  The tables needed to be wiped down and they had random trash strewn about like someone's BART ticket.  Note, this is a Taco Bell/KFC location without a drive thru.
The classiest TB/KFC you'll ever walk into. Food is fast, service is ULTRA friendly. Go in enough times and the manager makes a point of remembering your name and saying hi. Sometimes the line gets long but once you order your food comes out within minutes. Great place to grab some grub on the run.Enjoy!

The Taco Bell is good here, but the KFC chicken too salty, pot pie too much seasoning. Mac n cheese tasted horrible, just come here for Taco Bell, Irving for KFC
If you're looking for authentic Kentucky Fried Chicken or Mexican Tacos Bells, this is NOT the PLACE! I can assure you that this will satisfy your belly (and your wallet!) but if you want to truly enjoy your experience in eating a food, look elsewhare! The chicken was kind of dry, the "ground beef" was oily as heck! And the tortillas were not farm fresh! I will return because I love mediocre fast food, and don't get me started on those cheesy Gordita Crunches. Anyway my name is Caitlyn and i'm an alcoholic,
So I actually like Taco Bell. Yeah, it's fast food and all, but every now and then I get a TB craving and it's over.I recently moved to within about a 5 minute walk of this place. I was actually a little apprehensive since I thought I'd be there all the time and gain about 20 lbs. But this Taco Bell is TERRIBLE.The beans are thick and dry and taste like crap. The nacho cheese sauce tastes off. Everything is just smushed into your tortilla. I've only been twice since I moved here, and even when I really want Taco Bell I don't go here. I've  never had the chicken, but based on the taco offerings, methinks that they can't be any good either.
Literally the worst Taco Bell ever, and my expectations were already very low. My food took forever and was cold, they got my order wrong, the restaurant was filthy... Come on! One would think that they would have mastered a bean burrito by now.
It's a Taco Bell combined with KFC. You don't need a Yelp review to tell you how it's going to be.The reason I'm writing this review is to say that the customer service team's manner runs the gamut from rude and obnoxious to ineffectual and servile. Paulette frequently yells at her employees and can make a further unpleasant dining experience if you're hoping to have a quiet time, and frequently rushes your order. Some people seem to love her, many others seem to agree that she's obnoxious. As I write this review I find that this is the only time it's been quiet and approaching pleasant since I started visiting 3 months ago.I live around the corner from it so I will come here occasionally out of convenience and maybe Stockholm Syndrome for quiet moments like this. NO INDOOR VOICE. This might just seem nitpicky to some, but I work in the food industry and I hold my dining experiences to higher standards; fast food is not an excuse for abysmal customer service and atmosphere.  Two stars because it's nearby and convenient.
Not much has changed since last review. I have to say...I don't know if management (not ownership) has changed. This location is consistently dirty. There is always food on the floors, crumbs everywhere, wrappers here and there. While I believe people should clean up after themselves unfortunately they don't. The staff here needs to keep a better eye on these things and clean up the tables they have.They alse still have trouble keeping the cooked chicken "inventory" ready. They regularly don't have pieces ready and are always asking if people want to wait while they cook more.
Friendly staff, good service and clean facility. Overall, good experience here!Parking: STREET PARKING ONLYBE PREPARED TO HAVE SPARE COINS ON YOU, SOME SPOTS AROUND THE AREA MAYBE EQUIPPED WITH PARKING METERS.You can come here on MUNI Metro L-Taraval as well!If you start feeling hungry while completing homework assignments or studying for midterm/final, then KFC/Taco Bell is right across the street from Parkside Branch Library.Brief update for 7/2/2013:The staff members here are nice and friendly, service is efficient so I'll be back when I crave for the fast feed. I was very tempted to get a sweet treat to satisfy my sweet tooth. The cookies they have on display looked very delicious so I bought 3 chocolate chip cookies for $1.39.
I walk in and I'm greeted by a fly buzzing around my face. I swat it away and I go to the counter to order. The food is good- pretty much a standard taco bell joint. The tables look clean and it doesn't smell. GOOD. Its really funny tho as I people-watch bc there are flies flying around them as they eat their food. Hahaha. Good thing I'm sitting on the side...no flies here. I kinda didn't like how the cashier was like, what kind of dessert would you like with your order. I was like cool,  "it comes with dessert?" To which she responds, "no, it does not." ????? I wonder if this ever works on other customers. Hopefully not! Probably will not be coming here again. Bleh.
It is funny when walking into this Kentucky Fried Chicken/ Taco Bell and making ones order. There is a sign encourage people to go online and tell them how one's service was. When they know their service sucks, they don't bother even giving the receipt. So even they know when they are an ass. Most of the staff is pretty good, there are just a couple, but unfortunately the couple work in the front end.
4 stars for the dorito taco supreme!! Wow!! I love doritos dipped in sour cream so this was kind of like heaven for me. Eating too many would probably bring me to heaven too. I just had one to try but I keep thinking about it. The lady working there was crazy super friendly, hey good to know she loves her job!!
Once upon a time, I got the 2 chalupas and a taco, and I went on home merrily with my food. Oh boy, was I excited to eat! I loved chalupas :) so I got home, and I ate all my food.One or two hours later, I started getting stomach cramps. Then it started making the gurgling noises. Then I ran to the bathroom.The end.
The dining area is tiny, but the service is always good and my food comes out quick.
omg these people are so nice..the lady at the register is a sweetheart...fast food and nice people
If you avoid the Lincoln HS crowd, 5 stars. Because Paulette gives you the best sassy service ever. She'll throw in an extra few extra strips for your wait. And she will ask you what sauce you want and how many. She is the bomb. Four stars only because Paulette isn't always there.
I grew up with Taco Bell (though my parents never took me there, I went with friends afterschool) and I still get the occasional desire to think outside the bun.  Something about the taste of the Meximelt makes me feel like a teenager again.  I was genuinely excited that they finally brought back the low fat menu items and that they introduced the Volcano Taco.   The low fat fresco menu consists of 9 items and they provide calorie and fat content information on the sign and their website.  Nothing has over 8 grams of fat.  There aren't that many chicken options and they have too many crunchy tacos.  * Volcano taco ($1.09) - the red taco shell was crispy and spicy but also tasted stale.  The filling tastes the same as the usual Taco Bell taco though it's supposed to have a special sauce.* Ranchero chicken soft taco, fresco style ($2.45) - very salty and sour with dry chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and fiesta salsa.  I didn't like it because of the sour fiesta salsa, I think.  I should stick with the Meximelt or try another location.  I have been to enough locations to believe that they aren't all the same.  The food is better at some locations.The service was very perky and upbeat.  Surprisingly so.  The dining room looked like it hadn't been cleaned for awhile though.  The tables needed to be wiped down and they had random trash strewn about like someone's BART ticket.  Note, this is a Taco Bell/KFC location without a drive thru.
The classiest TB/KFC you'll ever walk into. Food is fast, service is ULTRA friendly. Go in enough times and the manager makes a point of remembering your name and saying hi. Sometimes the line gets long but once you order your food comes out within minutes. Great place to grab some grub on the run.Enjoy!
