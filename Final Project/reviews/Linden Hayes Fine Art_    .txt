A beautiful collection of 19th century California impressionist art is available for purchase.  These paintings with pastel colors and open scenery remind gallery visitors that there was a distinctive California landscape before new residents added homes on hillsides, and skyscrapers in the valleys. The pinks, tans and greens depict verdant valleys and mountains as if they were dreamlike visions. These original paintings by California artists were undervalued until recently, but now they are being "discovered" by collectors.  Our visit was welcomed and we got a mini art "lecture" by asking questions of Mark.  Visit next time you are in Hayes Valley, even if your wallet is not ready for a purchase, you will be surprised and intrigued.
The sales associate we spoke with (Mark ) was great, he gave us an extensive tour of Linden's large collection of California landscapes. He knew the gallery like the back of his hand, obviously an experienced collector.
