Little could I imagine that behind the Caltrain station in San Francisco there was hidden the Huffaker Park that for sure is going to be on my friendly for walkers list! I don't like commuting from San Jose to SF (and who does), but the good thing about it is that since the train arrives earlier I should enter at my workplace, I try to discover new streets, parks and areas. This was a total surprise, such a nice one: butterflies, beautiful trees, manicures gardens, yet all kind of wild. Houses on the water with tonalities from mint green to turquoise blue and yellow boats in between, mostly run down, totally charming. Behind that peaceful and serene scene, the big new expensive buildings (so no way to feel in the middle of nowhere). An oasis of peace and paradise for dog walkers.
The twisty little park sandwiched between a row of lovely houseboats and Channel St is a great place to go and chill while your dog chases butterflies and stealthy wood sprites. It seems like the kind of spot where you might  catch satyrs and griffins drinking wine and dancing under the light of a full moon on a cloudless night. There are all kinds of lovingly tended flowers, bushes and trees to ooh and ahh about.  I always stare curiously at the houseboats as I wander along the path, they seem like something from a different era, their playful colors and architecture in stark contrast to the bland condos rising up behind them. I'm so grateful for this unfenced little gem of a park in an area where most gates close at sunset and it's either make your dog duke in the street or in a tiny patch of scraggly greenery. There's also plenty of parking at Huffaker Park and I recommend bringing some refreshments while posting up on the dilapidated old tugboat overgrown with weeds and candied flowers.
