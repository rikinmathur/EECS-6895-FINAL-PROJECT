When I was a kid, I had to travel from Noe Valley to the Outer Richmond every day for school. After a few years of driving this distance on city streets, my mom decided it would be more fun to drive through Golden Gate Park. She was right. It was more fun. One of my favorite places to drive by was Rainbow Falls. Not only is it pretty, but I could often spot an egret or heron standing in the pool at the bottom. The reason I'm only giving it four stars is that occasionally, the falls are turned off. I'm not sure why the city does this, but it makes me sad when there's just a big blank wall of rock instead of a beautiful cascade of water.
So many things to see in GGP, this is just one of the many sights and s
After just moving to SF, I immediately wanted to explore my new hood, which included GG Park.  Each day, I would walk or run a little farther, until one day I ran into Rainbow Falls.  It is truly a sight to see--a real, functioning water fall right on JFK Drive.  Even on a bleak, overcast day, walking to Rainbow Falls still makes me happy.  After mentioning this to my roommate, she checked it out on a bike ride, and told me that the water wasn't flowing--hence the 4 star rating.  Even so, the waterfall is a great local attraction that you should check out some time.  I promise you won't be disappointed!
