I've been here twice for their quarterly "Night at the Jewseum" event, and I can't recommend it more highly. The exhibits seem to rotate quickly, and I've not been disappointed by any of them. It's nice to be able to have a drink, make some crafts, listen to some music, and explore some pop-up shops in between gallery exploration too.I also got an awesome shofar in the gift shop, and my cat loves (read: hates) it!
I went here for the Amy Winehouse exhibition, which was okay but really small. I was also berated before I went into the exhibition by a snotty woman who informed me that I'm not allowed to take my coffee into the exhibition (though I wasn't planning on it because I'm not an entitled moron) but then walked off quite huffily before telling me something useful like where there is a trash bin I might put my empty cup in.Average.
I came to the Contemporary Jewish Museum on one of their free Tuesday events and I was not disappointed.  When my group walked in, we were greeted by the museum's community relations director who gave us a brief overview of the space (who knew it used to be a PG&E building!) and the current exhibitions.  Being that I was with a group of my clients, I really appreciated this impromptu outreach.  The exhibitions were engaging, the space was large and beautifully designed, and the staff we interacted with were helpful.  If you enjoy contemporary art, check this place out.
Came here for the Bill Graham Exhibit and saw soooo much more!  My GF and I hit one of the 'Free Tuesday's' and were thrilled by all the other exhibits of photography, art, and other nick nacks!  The coffee shop that's attached is nice.  The gift shop is massive and the lawn/garden in front is a great spot for a picnic!  A wonderful place to spend an afternoon.  We will be back again and again!
$15 bucks for an adult, $10 for students. I was here for the Roman Vishniac Exhibit primarily which was an interesting photo gallery. That and a music exhibit on the upper floor. Then there was a small exhibit for the main floor. Another exhibit was currently being built on the main floor too but obv wasn't open. There was a good amount of stuff on the upper floor to spend some time but overall, 10 bucks is a little pricey when there isn't too much going on. It was a solid museum nonetheless.
After passing by the Contemporary Jewish Museum many times, I finally checked it out for the Amy Winehouse, A Family Portrait exhibit. The two level museum is bright and airy with clean modern lines. The Exhibit was located on the first floor and was contained in one relatively small room.  But it did provide a great display of portraits and memorabilia of Amy Winehouse and her family.  It was a well done exhibit and look forward to coming back for other interesting Exhibits.
What a gem!  I'm so thrilled we came.  I must admit, the only reason I wanted to come was to see the Amy Winehouse exhibit.  The exhibit was amazing, as expected.  A big bonus was the Warren Hellman/Hardly Strictly Bluegrass exhibit.  Also amazing.  But the real surprise was the museum itself.  Inexpensive by San Francisco standards ($12 per adult) and fully worth that admission price.  It is clean, organized, and not too crowded.  The exhibits are easy to access and full of delightful insight from the museum's curators.  I'm disappointed to see some of the less than stellar reviews about the CJM.  This IS NOT the Smithsonian.  It is not the Museum of Science and Industry.  It is not Le Louvre.  It is a small museum showcasing art and exploring the Jewish experience as well as presenting contributors to our society that happen to be Jewish.  For that, I am thankful that it has found a home in San Francisco.
Awesome museum with a lot of exhibitions and cool stuff happening all year long. I went there for the Amy Winehouse night exhibition and it was a very interesting experience, w/ lots of different things to do/see/learn. Including Amy Winehouse-buttons! And tattoos! And a makeup stand! That I sadly had not the time to check out. The best part was how cheap it was to get in ($5) and although the gallery was kinda small that night, it made me want to go during the day and see more.I will definitely go back; and advise you check out their website to learn about their latest showings.
After years of living in SF, I finally got to check out the Contemporary Jewish Museum for their Amy Winehouse exhibit.I've always admired the beautiful architecture on the outside, so I was curious how it would look on the inside. When you step in, it seems a lot smaller than it should and even the exhibit itself seemed to be contained in a relatively small room. That being said, the curation for the exhibit was done well and I'd be interested in going back for something in the future. Until then, I will continue to admire that beautiful building on my bike rides home.
Checked out Contemporary Jewish Museum Sat 11/29/14 had time to kill, it only take about 1hr to see this museum since it's small.Bottom floor is J.Otto Seibold and Mr. Lunch - I never read these children books, I really want to now.  Will see if library carries them.  Cute cartoons.  Photos allowed.Arnold Newman Masterclass - Upstairs, his photographs are Awesome!  Lots of famous people that he took pictures of.  Worth a visit to see.  Photos allowed.Hardly Strictly Warren Hellman - Upstairs, just a listening room where you can see old Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and listen to music, read about him.  No photos in there.If you have time and interest might be worth a visit.Regular adult $12Students & Seniors 65yrs $10Thurs after 5pm $5Closed WedMon-Sun 11-5; Thurs 11-8thecjm.org/home
I was pretty underwhelmed. I went on one of the free days because I had been looking forward to this museum for a long time. It wasn't memorable and aside from the really cool cube exterior and the excellent museum store, I can't recommend it :(I know they have an Amy Winehouse exhibit now so I may go back just for that but overall, the space wasn't curated well and wasn't FULL of art. Lots of empty and unused space. We saw everything in less than an hour.Two stars for the cool photo ops outside and the museum store (the SF Moma museum store being close by is also nice).
Excellent museum in all aspects: wonderful architecture, you feel like entering the Rubik cube, rotating exhibits, free a Tuesday a month, clean, spacious, nicely designed, selectively curated, plus an awesome deli. I see some reviews about being 'empty', well I think a museum does not need to be filled with objects and things, needs to help emerge the critical thinking of all of us and inspire. I went to see the Amy Winehouse exhibit and I was fully satisfied (maybe because I am a fan and seeing her dresses and vinyl collection plus other personal objects was already good enough for me). I also liked a lot another exhibit with drawings and items of the Jewish culture. I loved the pocket watch with Hebrew numerals, cool touch (never seen one) and messages that make you think: "diaspora is to be see", "life in diaspora is life in motion". Looking forward more great exhibits. Great job to the curators.
What a treat - The Jewish Contemporary Museum is an absolute jewel. It's modern, spacious, uncrowded (at least when I was there) and right across from easy parking.We went in to catch the Amy Winehouse exhibit, which did not disappoint. The room was basically dedicated to Amy, and held many of her personal items. There was also video display, and an interactive post-it note exhibit. Afterwards, we jumped upstairs for their current display that combines art & technology. Another winner.I also loved the gift shop - full of interesting items. Plus, and extra bonus is that their gift shop opens out, and across the path is the MOMA gift shop (another winner). We hit them both up. In way to spend an afternoon. Then jump across the street to Super Duper Burger, and you have an A+ day!
The CJM is a cool museum with a hip edge, displaying both permanent and rotating exhibits that are always unique and interesting. The nice architecture, little restaurant, gift shop, and kids area are pluses. Right near SF MOMA and across from Yerba Buena, also highly recommended, the CJM is a worthy destination for your enjoyment and edification. I go a couple times per year.
Much smaller than I thought, but very clean, great displays, no long line, FREE ADMISSION FOR B of A CUSTOMERS ON THE WEEKEND :).  Visited for the Amy exhibit.  Gift shop was really cool with cool Jewish jewelry and menorahs.  The time exhibit was my favorite besides the Amy exhibit.
Disappointing in the extreme.  I went on free day and it wasn't worth it.Beautiful, large building and friendly staff.The museum seemed to be mostly empty space.  Few exhibits had anything to do with Jews or Jewish culture, except the Hellman exhibit about bluegrass music (Hellman was Jewish).  The first floor had only a very boring fictional presentation about a group of artists, the movement being founded by an imaginary Catholic.  Nothing Jewish was mentioned in the story.The second floor had a couple, but very few, interesting works, but again having as much to do with Hindu or Buddhist culture as Jewish.Bottom line - don't waste your time and money unless you have a lot of each or want to see a specific item there.  If you're looking for stuff related to Judaism look elsewhere.
Beautiful space, but it's wasted. Exhibits are boring and offer nothing very new or interesting. Skirball in LA 1000x better. Don't waste your time or $. I was looking forward to contemporary or updated look at Jews compared to the old takes of the museums in NY and this is just such a huge disappointment.
As far as museums go, this one perpetuated the stereotype of being boring. I like to visit museums to learn about topics that I would not otherwise be interested in. I like seeing exhibits that will get me excited about knowledge, but maybe it was just bad timing that I did not see anything interesting at this museum. You really need to be into reading a LOT about Jewish history and culture and not being inspired by these works of art. Honestly I think the most interesting items in the entire building were part of the gift shop. I would not bring guests from out of town, but maybe if they had a special event here, I would give it another chance.
I'll admit that I stopped by here for one reason: it was the only museum that was open in the area I was in on a Monday. But since I do a lot of interfaith work, I was really interested to check out the exhibits and learn (and stay warm on a rainy day in SF!) The exhibits were SO interesting and all very different - the NEAT exhibit was my favorite. Seems like they have had some great exhibits in the past as well (Amy Winehouse, Andy Warhol, etc). The staff was very friendly - they had a free coat check and I was able to drop off some things as I walked around. Also as a heads up - they are right across from the SFMOMA Museum Store that's open (although SFMOMA is actually closed until May 2016), so it's nice to make a quick stop and check that out as well while you're around.
Beautiful Amy wine house exhibit as I was here for a Salesforce event and got a chance to enjoy it. I also did really like the globes above the entrance when you go inside. There's security that you need to go through before entering, and the white walls and space made the venue look very clean. Would love to return here for future events :)

I was also berated before I went into the exhibition by a snotty woman who informed me that I'm not allowed to take my coffee into the exhibition (though I wasn't planning on it because I'm not an entitled moron) but then walked off quite huffily before telling me something useful like where there is a trash bin I might put my empty cup in.Average.
I came to the Contemporary Jewish Museum on one of their free Tuesday events and I was not disappointed.  When my group walked in, we were greeted by the museum's community relations director who gave us a brief overview of the space (who knew it used to be a PG&E building!) and the current exhibitions.  Being that I was with a group of my clients, I really appreciated this impromptu outreach.  The exhibitions were engaging, the space was large and beautifully designed, and the staff we interacted with were helpful.  If you enjoy contemporary art, check this place out.
Came here for the Bill Graham Exhibit and saw soooo much more!  My GF and I hit one of the 'Free Tuesday's' and were thrilled by all the other exhibits of photography, art, and other nick nacks!  The coffee shop that's attached is nice.  The gift shop is massive and the lawn/garden in front is a great spot for a picnic!  A wonderful place to spend an afternoon.  We will be back again and again!
$15 bucks for an adult, $10 for students. I was here for the Roman Vishniac Exhibit primarily which was an interesting photo gallery. That and a music exhibit on the upper floor. Then there was a small exhibit for the main floor. Another exhibit was currently being built on the main floor too but obv wasn't open. There was a good amount of stuff on the upper floor to spend some time but overall, 10 bucks is a little pricey when there isn't too much going on. It was a solid museum nonetheless.
After passing by the Contemporary Jewish Museum many times, I finally checked it out for the Amy Winehouse, A Family Portrait exhibit. The two level museum is bright and airy with clean modern lines. The Exhibit was located on the first floor and was contained in one relatively small room.  But it did provide a great display of portraits and memorabilia of Amy Winehouse and her family.  It was a well done exhibit and look forward to coming back for other interesting Exhibits.
What a gem!  I'm so thrilled we came.  I must admit, the only reason I wanted to come was to see the Amy Winehouse exhibit.  The exhibit was amazing, as expected.  A big bonus was the Warren Hellman/Hardly Strictly Bluegrass exhibit.  Also amazing.  But the real surprise was the museum itself.  Inexpensive by San Francisco standards ($12 per adult) and fully worth that admission price.  It is clean, organized, and not too crowded.  The exhibits are easy to access and full of delightful insight from the museum's curators.  I'm disappointed to see some of the less than stellar reviews about the CJM.  This IS NOT the Smithsonian.  It is not the Museum of Science and Industry.  It is not Le Louvre.  It is a small museum showcasing art and exploring the Jewish experience as well as presenting contributors to our society that happen to be Jewish.  For that, I am thankful that it has found a home in San Francisco.
Awesome museum with a lot of exhibitions and cool stuff happening all year long. I went there for the Amy Winehouse night exhibition and it was a very interesting experience, w/ lots of different things to do/see/learn. Including Amy Winehouse-buttons! And tattoos! And a makeup stand! That I sadly had not the time to check out. The best part was how cheap it was to get in ($5) and although the gallery was kinda small that night, it made me want to go during the day and see more.I will definitely go back; and advise you check out their website to learn about their latest showings.
After years of living in SF, I finally got to check out the Contemporary Jewish Museum for their Amy Winehouse exhibit.I've always admired the beautiful architecture on the outside, so I was curious how it would look on the inside. When you step in, it seems a lot smaller than it should and even the exhibit itself seemed to be contained in a relatively small room. That being said, the curation for the exhibit was done well and I'd be interested in going back for something in the future. Until then, I will continue to admire that beautiful building on my bike rides home.
Checked out Contemporary Jewish Museum Sat 11/29/14 had time to kill, it only take about 1hr to see this museum since it's small.Bottom floor is J.Otto Seibold and Mr. Lunch - I never read these children books, I really want to now.  Will see if library carries them.  Cute cartoons.  Photos allowed.Arnold Newman Masterclass - Upstairs, his photographs are Awesome!  Lots of famous people that he took pictures of.  Worth a visit to see.  Photos allowed.Hardly Strictly Warren Hellman - Upstairs, just a listening room where you can see old Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and listen to music, read about him.  No photos in there.If you have time and interest might be worth a visit.Regular adult $12Students & Seniors 65yrs $10Thurs after 5pm $5Closed WedMon-Sun 11-5; Thurs 11-8thecjm.org/home
I was pretty underwhelmed. I went on one of the free days because I had been looking forward to this museum for a long time. It wasn't memorable and aside from the really cool cube exterior and the excellent museum store, I can't recommend it :(I know they have an Amy Winehouse exhibit now so I may go back just for that but overall, the space wasn't curated well and wasn't FULL of art. Lots of empty and unused space. We saw everything in less than an hour.Two stars for the cool photo ops outside and the museum store (the SF Moma museum store being close by is also nice).
Excellent museum in all aspects: wonderful architecture, you feel like entering the Rubik cube, rotating exhibits, free a Tuesday a month, clean, spacious, nicely designed, selectively curated, plus an awesome deli. I see some reviews about being 'empty', well I think a museum does not need to be filled with objects and things, needs to help emerge the critical thinking of all of us and inspire. I went to see the Amy Winehouse exhibit and I was fully satisfied (maybe because I am a fan and seeing her dresses and vinyl collection plus other personal objects was already good enough for me). I also liked a lot another exhibit with drawings and items of the Jewish culture. I loved the pocket watch with Hebrew numerals, cool touch (never seen one) and messages that make you think: "diaspora is to be see", "life in diaspora is life in motion". Looking forward more great exhibits. Great job to the curators.
What a treat - The Jewish Contemporary Museum is an absolute jewel. It's modern, spacious, uncrowded (at least when I was there) and right across from easy parking.We went in to catch the Amy Winehouse exhibit, which did not disappoint. The room was basically dedicated to Amy, and held many of her personal items. There was also video display, and an interactive post-it note exhibit. Afterwards, we jumped upstairs for their current display that combines art & technology. Another winner.I also loved the gift shop - full of interesting items. Plus, and extra bonus is that their gift shop opens out, and across the path is the MOMA gift shop (another winner). We hit them both up. In way to spend an afternoon. Then jump across the street to Super Duper Burger, and you have an A+ day!
The CJM is a cool museum with a hip edge, displaying both permanent and rotating exhibits that are always unique and interesting. The nice architecture, little restaurant, gift shop, and kids area are pluses. Right near SF MOMA and across from Yerba Buena, also highly recommended, the CJM is a worthy destination for your enjoyment and edification. I go a couple times per year.
Much smaller than I thought, but very clean, great displays, no long line, FREE ADMISSION FOR B of A CUSTOMERS ON THE WEEKEND :).  Visited for the Amy exhibit.  Gift shop was really cool with cool Jewish jewelry and menorahs.  The time exhibit was my favorite besides the Amy exhibit.
Disappointing in the extreme.  I went on free day and it wasn't worth it.Beautiful, large building and friendly staff.The museum seemed to be mostly empty space.  Few exhibits had anything to do with Jews or Jewish culture, except the Hellman exhibit about bluegrass music (Hellman was Jewish).  The first floor had only a very boring fictional presentation about a group of artists, the movement being founded by an imaginary Catholic.  Nothing Jewish was mentioned in the story.The second floor had a couple, but very few, interesting works, but again having as much to do with Hindu or Buddhist culture as Jewish.Bottom line - don't waste your time and money unless you have a lot of each or want to see a specific item there.  If you're looking for stuff related to Judaism look elsewhere.
Beautiful space, but it's wasted. Exhibits are boring and offer nothing very new or interesting. Skirball in LA 1000x better. Don't waste your time or $. I was looking forward to contemporary or updated look at Jews compared to the old takes of the museums in NY and this is just such a huge disappointment.
As far as museums go, this one perpetuated the stereotype of being boring. I like to visit museums to learn about topics that I would not otherwise be interested in. I like seeing exhibits that will get me excited about knowledge, but maybe it was just bad timing that I did not see anything interesting at this museum. You really need to be into reading a LOT about Jewish history and culture and not being inspired by these works of art. Honestly I think the most interesting items in the entire building were part of the gift shop. I would not bring guests from out of town, but maybe if they had a special event here, I would give it another chance.
I'll admit that I stopped by here for one reason: it was the only museum that was open in the area I was in on a Monday. But since I do a lot of interfaith work, I was really interested to check out the exhibits and learn (and stay warm on a rainy day in SF!) The exhibits were SO interesting and all very different - the NEAT exhibit was my favorite. Seems like they have had some great exhibits in the past as well (Amy Winehouse, Andy Warhol, etc). The staff was very friendly - they had a free coat check and I was able to drop off some things as I walked around. Also as a heads up - they are right across from the SFMOMA Museum Store that's open (although SFMOMA is actually closed until May 2016), so it's nice to make a quick stop and check that out as well while you're around.
Beautiful Amy wine house exhibit as I was here for a Salesforce event and got a chance to enjoy it. I also did really like the globes above the entrance when you go inside. There's security that you need to go through before entering, and the white walls and space made the venue look very clean. Would love to return here for future events :)
