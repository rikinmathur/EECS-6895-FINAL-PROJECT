This chicken was much, much more enjoyable than its KFC equivalent.  This stuff tasted fresher (while still under a heat lamp- see photo) and I appreciated the ability to order a few pieces spicy and the rest regular in my combo bucket. The potatoes were also delicious in comparison and would do well on their own I suppose also.  They were in a smaller bowl and the gravy was in with the potatoes.  Go Wednesday in the early evening if you can- no lines.  However it sounds like Tuesday is the day to go for deals.Very glad I finally tried Popeye's- I think there's one in Dixon and KFC is a bit depressing nowadays.
I'd actually never had Popeyes fried chicken before.But Shark Week had just started, so naturally I needed something salty. No, not the annual Discovery Channel series Shark Week...Shark Week is "that time of the month."Yes, gentlemen, during Shark Week we ladies need certain things...& stat.  All diets, calorie counting, & regular preferences go out the window.  It's not our faults.  It's chemical.  It's when otherwise normally conservative & even dainty diners turn into the most fervent.  Salty & sweet foods turn into the equivalent of a slab of meat to a lion.  Once I went through 3 candy bars in one sitting.  A Reese's, an Almond Joy, & a Kit Kat.  I'd never done that before or since, but so exemplifies the power of Shark Week.So...Now you understand how & why I needed fried chicken.  And being that I've already had KFC of course, I'd been curious about Popeyes.  I just remembered that scene in the movie, The Devil's Advocate, when Charlize Theron is painting their new apartment...she's eating takeout from Popeyes.  If it's good enough for an Al Pacino movie...So off my man went to pick up some Popeyes fried chicken. The verdict?  It was crispy.  It was spicy.  But I wasn't impressed.  It took care of my craving, but ultimately was underwhelming.  I'm thinking next Shark Week I'll stick w The Front Porch...Or a bag of Lay's.2 & 1/2 stars.
Damn b*stards. Maybe the 6th time in my life where this location has given me an apple pie instead of the pie I ordered (strawberry/cherry/blueberry/etc). I am convinced it is a  scam on their end. Nobody orders the apple pies so they slip it in your order and pretend they made a mistake. Always check your pie before leaving!!
I had this for lunch today and besides the impending heart disease, it was sooooooo awesome. But really you're charging me a quarter for your delectable sweet heat sauce when I just spent $10 bucks on chicken?Anyway Popeyes spicy is some of my favorite fried chicken of all time--including fancy restaurants that charge 4X the price. So I will pay the damn quarter for sweet heat.
Place is a zoo with crazy outer mission people. But $1.99 Tuesdays pretty good. Expect alittle wait.Its good to bring home or to a party.16 pieces chicken only- $20.49No grilled. Only fried original and spicy.They do offer fried seafood too.
I have to pay to use the bathroom.... Are you freaking insane?!?Thx for bringing me to the point of almost pissing in your corner. I'll be sure to do that next time I stop in.
Fast service. The food is great, I love beans and rice And spicy chicken wings.But the attitude of the employees is not the best, seems like they're not getting a good pay, and I don't blame them.
Chicken, fish, red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes are all great. I can't complain about any of those things.Prices = moderate. Service = NOT attentive. Or they just don't give a rat's ass. Fix your customer service. NOW. Every time I order, I say I do NOT want the biscuit. Yes, I'll pay for it (dinner or combo, since I like the sides) so you can KEEP IT. They always give me the effin' biscuit, and I end up THROWING it out.  Listen to your PAYING customer. How hard is that??!  This location has the worst biscuits. Discoloration on the bottom of the biscuit from the metal pan. I do not want that, ever! (No, it's not burnt.) Go AWAY.
I must say I like popeyes way more than KFC. Located on geneva and mission its usually quite busy making the wait a bit more than usual at times. Spicy chicken is usually really crispy and has a good amount of chicken meat rather than being filled with just batter. It tastes pretty well with their honey sauce.Biscuits are way better than KFC in that its less saltier and taste fresher and also goes well with a little bit of their honey sauceMy absolute favorite is their mac and cheese. It has a yummy cheesy taste to it that definitely beats KFC mac and cheese. This is a go to spot for a fast meal for on the go.
Super wack, more than 10 mins until closing and they didn't want to cook more chicken and/or bad planning on cooking enough for the last batch. I understand workers gotta close up shop but don't advertise you're open until 10pm but have no product to sell to your loyal customers. Especially, when you got hella customers trying to buy it. Yea I understand they been working all day and are especially busy on a Tuesday but the company created that frenzy and the customers are not to blame. They got to understand that people will come even at the last minute before closing because they get off work late and are hungry. This is a working class neighborhood and many of them, similarly to me, walked to get there! So Weak! Don't get me wrong, DEFINITELY no knock on the workers because the work HARD! Bad management or bad policies and business practices on Corporate Popeyes is what it is!!!
$1.69 legs and thighs on Tuesday and line nearly out the door. Come early so the chicken is still fresh.  Service is just ok - don't expect to eat-in on Tuesdays. Sides (esp. Cajun fries) tend to be under seasoned and not fresh on Tuesdays. Came once when it isn't a Tuesday and the sides were still under seasoned.
Haven't been to this place for 15 years. Looks like it has been remodel since the last time i was here. Luckily came at a time where there wasnt a lot of people so it made the service go quick. First time i came back was couple months ago. Order the 16 pieces family pack which cost 37.51 total. Kinda of expensive but had a lot of food. Did half mild and half spicy at the time but we didnt know how spicy it was at the time. Other then the 16 pieces chickens, you had the biscuits plus 3 more side orders which i got the cole shaw, fries, and mash potatoes.Then came back again yesterday but order 8 pieces family pack. Only difference from the 16 piece family pack is they give you one side other than the biscuits. Decided to get all spicy since the spicy had more flavor than the mild and it isnt that spicy from the time my family went here couple months ago. Service was quick since my family only order spicy. The chicken here is good. Definitely come back whenever my family crave for their chicken again
CHICKENNNNNNN WHY U SO GOOOOOOOOOD.If I was dirt poor, I would come to this Popeyes every tuesday for their fantastic deals on fried chicken.If I was filthy rich. I would force my chauffeur to get out of the car to get this chicken.The neighborhood is a bit frightening. There are a lot of hooded characters wearing assorted colorful hoodlum shoes that make me wait in my car for prolonged periods of time until they have dissipated. At that point, I quickly dart out of my vehicle and make the trip to Popeyes as if I'm a coyote crossing the Mexican border. When in the Popeyes, the aroma is intoxicating. Eyes grow to the size of plates, stomach roars of hunger, and mouth salivates like you just walked into a goddamn Popeyes.But this place is pretty Ghetto: -I saw a guy fill a laundry bucket with Soda. (Great freaking idea.)-The soda fountain had a sign that displayed "Ain't none left." (Signaling that the machine was in fact out of the desired flavor of soda.)
This is your run of the mill Popeye's that is super busy since it is on the intersection of two busy streets (Mission and Geneva). It is NUTS on Tuesday so avoid it.  On Tuesday they have 2 pieces legs and thighs for 99c. There are very few tables so don't plan on eating there on Tuesdays.
Usually, employees at the Popeye's I've been to are typically nice, efficient, and welcoming . . . this location, not so much.Their door was open prior to hours stated and an over-weight Asian man was eating chicken at a booth inside, I casually walked in and that person looks up and says in a rude tone, "We're not open, leave!"When I made a complaint with the Manager, Pablo, instead of listening to my constructive criticism, he talked over me, flipped the situation to make me look like the "bad guy" and then refused service after I asked for their corporate number to make a formal complaint.So, I made a formal complaint with their corporate office, and they agreed that is not how you conduct operations; mind you, I am an operations manager for a major corporation.I can see why I don't usually eat at Popeye's, and it's unfortunate that this experience may have me never returning to one again.
This location is very bad... it's in the Corner Geneva Avenue and Mission. Right in front of the store is a bus stop, so the curb is painted red for those very long Muni Buses to stop. On top that, the stop light Geneva side turning right into mission no turn on Red light.  And no left turn except Muni buses... this is a very, very busy intersection. That is why this place is not ideal even for street parking. You would have to park and walk a block or two to get here.  The place is half the size of regular Popeye's I have been to.  I go here because it is the closest one for me. They do have Tuesday specials on chicken pieces and that is when there are so many people go there.  I like their chicken better than KFC (I'm closer to KFC than Popeye's) that is why I go here once every two or three months.
It's depressing to say, but in the Excelsior outer mission area, this Popeye's is considered by many in the area and nearby surrounding areas as a 5-star restaurant for fried chicken/spicy soul food with the best prices - just note the long lines for the tuesday deals which includes every ethnicity in the area of asians, latinos, whites, in addition to blacks.  KFC on Silver Ave & Mission has had a reputation in the past (maybe better now since it seems to have improved in quality 2 days ago when I was there) as serving badly cooked raw or overcooked seemingly frozen old-tasting food for expensive prices and even their side dishes are much less quality-worthy than Popeye's, so there are longer lines for Popeye's than KFC even though they're both in high-traffic areas and both have Tuesday or other deals.  Other reviewers talk about how BIG the KFC chicken is, but how do they get that big??  Because of a super helping of antibiotics & hormones?? No thanks.   So the only reason I give it a 5-star is for those reasons. Popeye's is VERY tiny with very few tables so yes, I agree with another poster that you should get your food to go, especially during their deal days with fast but long lines and yes, parking is difficult in this high-traffic area.I would NOT go out my way to go here, but if you're in the area, this is the best/cheapest place to eat, especially for a large box of chicken & excellent sides(cajun rice, beans & rice, coleslaw, etc.) to feed a family or large number of people.
Tends to always have a line. Good food but cashiers tend to have an attitude every time I go. Would still go back since it's the closest to me. As long as you don't mind the cashiers and a bit of a wait then head here!
I got my favorites near home.  It's a good spot.  If I was on the bus it's even better.
If it's not Tuesday, there isn't much of a wait for anything here. If you've had Popeye's before, it's pretty much the same here. I really don't like the shrimp here. There's just something about it that makes you feel like you're eating dog food. I don't recommend at all despite the price they always throw at your face on commercials.

They do have Tuesday specials on chicken pieces and that is when there are so many people go there.  I like their chicken better than KFC (I'm closer to KFC than Popeye's) that is why I go here once every two or three months.
It's depressing to say, but in the Excelsior outer mission area, this Popeye's is considered by many in the area and nearby surrounding areas as a 5-star restaurant for fried chicken/spicy soul food with the best prices - just note the long lines for the tuesday deals which includes every ethnicity in the area of asians, latinos, whites, in addition to blacks.  KFC on Silver Ave & Mission has had a reputation in the past (maybe better now since it seems to have improved in quality 2 days ago when I was there) as serving badly cooked raw or overcooked seemingly frozen old-tasting food for expensive prices and even their side dishes are much less quality-worthy than Popeye's, so there are longer lines for Popeye's than KFC even though they're both in high-traffic areas and both have Tuesday or other deals.  Other reviewers talk about how BIG the KFC chicken is, but how do they get that big??  Because of a super helping of antibiotics & hormones?? No thanks.   So the only reason I give it a 5-star is for those reasons. Popeye's is VERY tiny with very few tables so yes, I agree with another poster that you should get your food to go, especially during their deal days with fast but long lines and yes, parking is difficult in this high-traffic area.I would NOT go out my way to go here, but if you're in the area, this is the best/cheapest place to eat, especially for a large box of chicken & excellent sides(cajun rice, beans & rice, coleslaw, etc.) to feed a family or large number of people.
Tends to always have a line. Good food but cashiers tend to have an attitude every time I go. Would still go back since it's the closest to me. As long as you don't mind the cashiers and a bit of a wait then head here!
I got my favorites near home.  It's a good spot.  If I was on the bus it's even better.
If it's not Tuesday, there isn't much of a wait for anything here. If you've had Popeye's before, it's pretty much the same here. I really don't like the shrimp here. There's just something about it that makes you feel like you're eating dog food. I don't recommend at all despite the price they always throw at your face on commercials.
This chicken was much, much more enjoyable than its KFC equivalent.  This stuff tasted fresher (while still under a heat lamp- see photo) and I appreciated the ability to order a few pieces spicy and the rest regular in my combo bucket. The potatoes were also delicious in comparison and would do well on their own I suppose also.  They were in a smaller bowl and the gravy was in with the potatoes.  Go Wednesday in the early evening if you can- no lines.  However it sounds like Tuesday is the day to go for deals.Very glad I finally tried Popeye's- I think there's one in Dixon and KFC is a bit depressing nowadays.
I'd actually never had Popeyes fried chicken before.But Shark Week had just started, so naturally I needed something salty. No, not the annual Discovery Channel series Shark Week...Shark Week is "that time of the month."Yes, gentlemen, during Shark Week we ladies need certain things...& stat.  All diets, calorie counting, & regular preferences go out the window.  It's not our faults.  It's chemical.  It's when otherwise normally conservative & even dainty diners turn into the most fervent.  Salty & sweet foods turn into the equivalent of a slab of meat to a lion.  Once I went through 3 candy bars in one sitting.  A Reese's, an Almond Joy, & a Kit Kat.  I'd never done that before or since, but so exemplifies the power of Shark Week.So...Now you understand how & why I needed fried chicken.  And being that I've already had KFC of course, I'd been curious about Popeyes.  I just remembered that scene in the movie, The Devil's Advocate, when Charlize Theron is painting their new apartment...she's eating takeout from Popeyes.  If it's good enough for an Al Pacino movie...So off my man went to pick up some Popeyes fried chicken. The verdict?  It was crispy.  It was spicy.  But I wasn't impressed.  It took care of my craving, but ultimately was underwhelming.  I'm thinking next Shark Week I'll stick w The Front Porch...Or a bag of Lay's.2 & 1/2 stars.
Damn b*stards. Maybe the 6th time in my life where this location has given me an apple pie instead of the pie I ordered (strawberry/cherry/blueberry/etc). I am convinced it is a  scam on their end. Nobody orders the apple pies so they slip it in your order and pretend they made a mistake. Always check your pie before leaving!!
I had this for lunch today and besides the impending heart disease, it was sooooooo awesome. But really you're charging me a quarter for your delectable sweet heat sauce when I just spent $10 bucks on chicken?Anyway Popeyes spicy is some of my favorite fried chicken of all time--including fancy restaurants that charge 4X the price. So I will pay the damn quarter for sweet heat.
Place is a zoo with crazy outer mission people. But $1.99 Tuesdays pretty good. Expect alittle wait.Its good to bring home or to a party.16 pieces chicken only- $20.49No grilled. Only fried original and spicy.They do offer fried seafood too.
I have to pay to use the bathroom.... Are you freaking insane?!?Thx for bringing me to the point of almost pissing in your corner. I'll be sure to do that next time I stop in.
Fast service. The food is great, I love beans and rice And spicy chicken wings.But the attitude of the employees is not the best, seems like they're not getting a good pay, and I don't blame them.
Chicken, fish, red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes are all great. I can't complain about any of those things.Prices = moderate. Service = NOT attentive. Or they just don't give a rat's ass. Fix your customer service. NOW. Every time I order, I say I do NOT want the biscuit. Yes, I'll pay for it (dinner or combo, since I like the sides) so you can KEEP IT. They always give me the effin' biscuit, and I end up THROWING it out.  Listen to your PAYING customer. How hard is that??!  This location has the worst biscuits. Discoloration on the bottom of the biscuit from the metal pan. I do not want that, ever! (No, it's not burnt.) Go AWAY.
I must say I like popeyes way more than KFC. Located on geneva and mission its usually quite busy making the wait a bit more than usual at times. Spicy chicken is usually really crispy and has a good amount of chicken meat rather than being filled with just batter. It tastes pretty well with their honey sauce.Biscuits are way better than KFC in that its less saltier and taste fresher and also goes well with a little bit of their honey sauceMy absolute favorite is their mac and cheese. It has a yummy cheesy taste to it that definitely beats KFC mac and cheese. This is a go to spot for a fast meal for on the go.
Super wack, more than 10 mins until closing and they didn't want to cook more chicken and/or bad planning on cooking enough for the last batch. I understand workers gotta close up shop but don't advertise you're open until 10pm but have no product to sell to your loyal customers. Especially, when you got hella customers trying to buy it. Yea I understand they been working all day and are especially busy on a Tuesday but the company created that frenzy and the customers are not to blame. They got to understand that people will come even at the last minute before closing because they get off work late and are hungry. This is a working class neighborhood and many of them, similarly to me, walked to get there! So Weak! Don't get me wrong, DEFINITELY no knock on the workers because the work HARD! Bad management or bad policies and business practices on Corporate Popeyes is what it is!!!
$1.69 legs and thighs on Tuesday and line nearly out the door. Come early so the chicken is still fresh.  Service is just ok - don't expect to eat-in on Tuesdays. Sides (esp. Cajun fries) tend to be under seasoned and not fresh on Tuesdays. Came once when it isn't a Tuesday and the sides were still under seasoned.
Haven't been to this place for 15 years. Looks like it has been remodel since the last time i was here. Luckily came at a time where there wasnt a lot of people so it made the service go quick. First time i came back was couple months ago. Order the 16 pieces family pack which cost 37.51 total. Kinda of expensive but had a lot of food. Did half mild and half spicy at the time but we didnt know how spicy it was at the time. Other then the 16 pieces chickens, you had the biscuits plus 3 more side orders which i got the cole shaw, fries, and mash potatoes.Then came back again yesterday but order 8 pieces family pack. Only difference from the 16 piece family pack is they give you one side other than the biscuits. Decided to get all spicy since the spicy had more flavor than the mild and it isnt that spicy from the time my family went here couple months ago. Service was quick since my family only order spicy. The chicken here is good. Definitely come back whenever my family crave for their chicken again
CHICKENNNNNNN WHY U SO GOOOOOOOOOD.If I was dirt poor, I would come to this Popeyes every tuesday for their fantastic deals on fried chicken.If I was filthy rich. I would force my chauffeur to get out of the car to get this chicken.The neighborhood is a bit frightening. There are a lot of hooded characters wearing assorted colorful hoodlum shoes that make me wait in my car for prolonged periods of time until they have dissipated. At that point, I quickly dart out of my vehicle and make the trip to Popeyes as if I'm a coyote crossing the Mexican border. When in the Popeyes, the aroma is intoxicating. Eyes grow to the size of plates, stomach roars of hunger, and mouth salivates like you just walked into a goddamn Popeyes.But this place is pretty Ghetto: -I saw a guy fill a laundry bucket with Soda. (Great freaking idea.)-The soda fountain had a sign that displayed "Ain't none left." (Signaling that the machine was in fact out of the desired flavor of soda.)
This is your run of the mill Popeye's that is super busy since it is on the intersection of two busy streets (Mission and Geneva). It is NUTS on Tuesday so avoid it.  On Tuesday they have 2 pieces legs and thighs for 99c. There are very few tables so don't plan on eating there on Tuesdays.
Usually, employees at the Popeye's I've been to are typically nice, efficient, and welcoming . . . this location, not so much.Their door was open prior to hours stated and an over-weight Asian man was eating chicken at a booth inside, I casually walked in and that person looks up and says in a rude tone, "We're not open, leave!"When I made a complaint with the Manager, Pablo, instead of listening to my constructive criticism, he talked over me, flipped the situation to make me look like the "bad guy" and then refused service after I asked for their corporate number to make a formal complaint.So, I made a formal complaint with their corporate office, and they agreed that is not how you conduct operations; mind you, I am an operations manager for a major corporation.I can see why I don't usually eat at Popeye's, and it's unfortunate that this experience may have me never returning to one again.
This location is very bad... it's in the Corner Geneva Avenue and Mission. Right in front of the store is a bus stop, so the curb is painted red for those very long Muni Buses to stop. On top that, the stop light Geneva side turning right into mission no turn on Red light.  And no left turn except Muni buses... this is a very, very busy intersection. That is why this place is not ideal even for street parking. You would have to park and walk a block or two to get here.  The place is half the size of regular Popeye's I have been to.  I go here because it is the closest one for me.
