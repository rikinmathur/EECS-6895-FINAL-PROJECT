The views are great up here. You have a great view of Twin Peaks and Sutro Tower in addition to a panoramic view of San Francisco and the neighborhoods South/West of town. The giant cross is a nice monument and its location back in the woods is a great spot for some quiet reflection. Now I notice the cross all the time poking up just above the trees.I think I took the hard way up, it made for a tough but short hike through the woods from the North side of the park.
We visited on a foggy/drizzly weekday morning in late February & had the entire place to ourselves.  The relatively short (approx 1-mile round trip) & easy walk up was quiet except for the many birds, whose various calls & fluttering about actually added to the overall peaceful atmosphere of the morning.  When we reached the top, the panoramic view of the city was unsurprisingly obscured by fog, but that was beautiful in it's own SF kind of way.  A little bit farther uphill & a bit into the woods, the enormous cross rises up.  It's much larger in person than I expected.  And in the quiet, gloomy morning, against the fog, the towering cross can be a tad intimidating.There are several smaller, beautiful, verdant paths near the monument, one in particular with stone steps, that is definitely worth exploring.  But the coolest thing you should know about Mount Davidson is the "Ransom Run" scene in Dirty Harry was filmed here! youtu.be/soZZ_agKT8E  I really enjoyed this park; it's really beautiful & part of SF iconic film history.  Highly recommend if you're in the area!
Highest natural point in San Francisco? This place is a really nice place for pictures and a breath of fresh air, but it is no hike. There's two places you can start from, either from the bottom of the forest or near the bus stop in the back. Walking from the bottom during a foggy day makes you feel like you've stepped into another world away from SF. Overgrowth on tall trees with rays of sunlight piercing the thick fog and tree canopy. My ideal type of hike right there. I came in from the back with a couple of friends. If you walk a few minutes up, you're already there. Views you can see from here are the Sutro Tower, Twin Peaks, and the entire eastern half of San Francisco. Honestly I think views on Grand View Park or Twin Peaks have nicer panoramic views of the city, but I loved it here too.Definitely come here for the giant cross, and the famous fallen tree! The cross is massive in size, and the tree is fun for climbing. Great photo opportunities all around. You might need a buddy to help you to sit on top of the branch. Trust me the branches are more than sturdy enough for the average guy.
FYI this is not really a hike. I don't know where we got the idea that it was, but we made the effort to wake up early on a Saturday, came fully geared and ready to sweat, only to take a 15 minute stroll straight to the top. In this kind of situation, you can't even pretend it was a workout.  Nevertheless, it was a beautiful panoramic view of the entire city and most definitely worth it. Considering how easy it is to get here, I can see why it's a destination for so many photographers. And as predicted, we did see someone with a tripod at the top.If anything, Mount Davidson is probably better for a run since there are multiple short trails around the park. It wasn't that crowded (even for a Saturday!) so this might just be the perfect escape from the pedestrian-filled sidewalks and roads of SF! Plus it's always nice to go running somewhere with a view!
A great spot for hiking!! It was pretty cold and gloomy when we went, which I think is the perfect weather to hike. It's a small walk uphill and once you get to the top, the view is amazing! The pictures definitely don't do it justice. You get a 360 view of the entire city!! Once you walk into the woods, you'll find a huge cross. It's a monument for the Armenian genocide. It's a really cool sight, surrounded by the trees. There are little trails within the woods so you can do some exploring. I highly recommend it if you're in SF!
This place isn't really a hike, but it is a nice walk and a nice place to take photos of SF since you can see the downtown area from far away. It gets chilly while walking uphill and I went the day after it rained, so the floor was super muddy and wet still. The huge cross was tall and dirty, and it's amazing how the monument lasts so long throughout these years. Very cool cross though! I also walked towards the famous tree with multiple branches sticking out. It's a struggle to get on the branch and sit on top of the branch, but it's doable! Just need to use them abs and have a person help out. The branches are really smooth so you can't really fall. I was scared cause to me it seemed really high up! This park is a nice place to just chill and I recommend tourists to come see the cross.
Great hike with a very beautiful view of the city. Be careful on the trails as the rocks are a bit slippery at some points. There is a nice tree on the top of the hill for pictures. Climbing the tree is easy but getting off may be a bit tricky. In my experience, the best way is to slide it down. Yes, slide down the tree. It may sound a bit crazy, but it works. Above the hill with the tree is the giant cross. This hike has several trails that all lead to the top. If the path splits off and you are not sure if it is a trail then do not go on it. It will most likely lead to a dead end and you will have to go back. DO NOT go off the trail and try to create your own shortcut. There are a bunch of thorns everywhere and you will only be hurting yourself and nature. I had a friend who did that because he went off on a trail that led to a dead end and tried to make a shortcut back to the main trail. He came back with cuts everywhere. Overall, an easy hike if you stick on the main trail and always go up. Also, this hike could definitely benefit from having signs.
Nice hike to top of the highest natural point in Bay Area and the Mount Davidson memorial cross. Near panoramic views. Multiple back dirt trails. Caution, slippery after rain.(This entry written by husband)
I absolutely love coming to this beautiful sight! It only takes about 15 minutes to walk to the top, plus it's all shaded by trees. There's also plenty of parking by the street entrance, and the parking is pretty much flat. I highly recommend wearing layers because it's very windy at the top of the mountain! Also, don't even try wearing a hat.
Something worth depriving sleep over. Woke up at 5:15 and caught a Lyft line here for $11. One mistake I did do was actually do a actual legit hike up the mountain versus knowing that there was a straight shot up the mountain on the other side near the bus stop. We had to use your iPhone lights to guide ourselves up at such a early morning time with it being dark out and foggy. But when we get up there it was well worth the hike and exercise. Do some research on iPhone as to when is the actual sunrise for the best views. I recommended getting 15-20 minutes there prior get a couple of use one with the nightlights still over San Francisco and a couple of the sunrise,All in all I think this is a must do for all visitors into San Francisco.
Beautiful easy stroll. I wouldn't call it a hike, but it definitely has the views of sf to daly city when you reach the top. Not to mention, a huge cross....
I'm not sure I would call the walk up a hike since it takes maybe 10 minutes at most, but there's a really nice view of SF from the top. The place doesn't seem as well known so there aren't as many people here, even on the weekend, which is perfect if you want to climb the dead tree and take your time taking pictures.For those of you who want to get pictures on the tree, it's actually not that high up, but it's not quite as easy as it looks to climb. Or maybe it was just me that struggled a lot..There's a few options for you to get up the tree:1. Climb up the side/trunk - Unfortunately, the trunk of the tree is incredibly smooth and slippery and my shoes lacked the traction for me to safely climb up that way without sliding down2. Have a friend hoist you up - Assuming you came with a friend to take pictures for you. I rejected this option because I stubbornly wanted to get up by myself3. Hoist/swing yourself up - I opted for this option and rather ungracefully swung my legs up and around the branch to get up4. Bring a stool or something else to stand on - I wish someone had told me this beforehand..The branch shakes pretty easily so if it's windy up there, it might be a little scary sitting up there! There's also a giant cross further up the hill.
Arrived here in the fog as it began to clear up. It is a short hike and kid friendly. I saw a group of kids in little vests  with their dad when I went and they were adorable. It is muddy during the winter season so I advise you wear shoes that you won't mind getting dirty.I didn't get to explore the entire park and simply went to the top to see the tree and the view. It was worth it and amazing. Dogs are allowed as long as they are on leashes and there is a bench where the tree is if you decide you want to sit down on something other than the tree.I don't get how people  manage to sit near the tip of the branch. You all are intense tree-climbers  ( in which I am not). Definitely a good place to immerse yourself in forestry. It is beautiful even in the fog.
What a fantastic, underrated hike in SF! The panoramic, unobstructed views of the bay and the city are incredible. We started our hike on the unmarked trail off of Dalewood Way, and during the initial hike you'll forget you're in the city. We hiked through eucalyptus forests lined with vibrant green ferns and ivy. Once you circle around the ridge you'll be surprised with a glimpse of the bay, and as you continue your hike up the view gets even better. This hike is a round trip 1.5 miles. It's a moderate, pretty quick hike and it's definitely worth the view from the highest peak in SF (938 ft). Don't forget to bring your dog because this place is dog-friendly, but leashes required.
One of the most underrated spots in the city. The 103-foot white cross at the top has a ton of history over the Easter Sunday of the mid-20th century, and of course you should go for your picture of #thatSFtree with an amazing overlook of the city at large, as well as views over the East Bay and south towards San Bruno. You can easily spy on people at the top of Twin Peaks and near the Sutro Tower too! Easy climbs to the top.
it's a remarkable spot you could see entire downtown already has expanded over the years to Sue's of different path you could go and view 360° view of San Francisco
Easy hike! Took my parents along and it was short. Took about half an hour each way. There's a giant cross you can visit or there is a dead tree which people like to take pictures with. This place has an awesome lookout of the city. One of the highest spots in San Francisco. You can even see where twin peaks is located at. Dogs are allowed too! Just keep an eye on them.
Definitely worth a stroll up if you're in the neighborhood! There are entrances all around the base of the mountain and they're all different. Some are winding and wooded, others are large enough for a vehicle and climb right to the top. The further uphill your trail entrance, the easier the hike will be. If you want more of a challenge, look for a trail near the bottom. I started at the bottom, came out near the top and it took an hour, including photographs. There are so many side trails thought that you could spend a lot more time wandering around if you wanted to. In general, trails that go more or less straight will take you around the mount to see all the different views. But be warned that this trail was narrow and rocky at times. It does require that you pay attention and be careful. There are others that split off and go up to the top or down to the bottom in a more direct route. You'll get to the top regardless and there are wonderful picture views up there.
This park gives an amazing view of the city! It's a very short and easy stroll to the top. I almost felt bad for looking at such an amazing view when I didn't even have to walk that much to get there.There is a cool looking dead tree at the top where people sometimes climb and take photos. On the other side of the park (this depends on where you start walking up) there is a cross.
Mt Davidson has views that are as great as Twin Peaks but without the crowds. Like Bernal Heights the only way to get up here is to walk. But in this case you'll be hiking up through trees. The view only appears at the top where it will surprise you - along with the giant cross.Many people don't know about the giant cross because it faces southwest so it's not visible from the center of town. It's a massive monument to the Armenian genocide in Turkey. Apparently it was also featured in Dirty Harry.Now that I've been up Mt Davidson I've finally covered the "the Seven Hills of San Francisco"(Telegraph Hill, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Rincon Hill, Mount Sutro, Twin Peaks and Mount Davidson). It only took me 9 years!
The views are great up here. You have a great view of Twin Peaks and Sutro Tower in addition to a panoramic view of San Francisco and the neighborhoods South/West of town.

The place doesn't seem as well known so there aren't as many people here, even on the weekend, which is perfect if you want to climb the dead tree and take your time taking pictures.For those of you who want to get pictures on the tree, it's actually not that high up, but it's not quite as easy as it looks to climb. Or maybe it was just me that struggled a lot..There's a few options for you to get up the tree:1. Climb up the side/trunk - Unfortunately, the trunk of the tree is incredibly smooth and slippery and my shoes lacked the traction for me to safely climb up that way without sliding down2. Have a friend hoist you up - Assuming you came with a friend to take pictures for you. I rejected this option because I stubbornly wanted to get up by myself3. Hoist/swing yourself up - I opted for this option and rather ungracefully swung my legs up and around the branch to get up4. Bring a stool or something else to stand on - I wish someone had told me this beforehand..The branch shakes pretty easily so if it's windy up there, it might be a little scary sitting up there! There's also a giant cross further up the hill.
Arrived here in the fog as it began to clear up. It is a short hike and kid friendly. I saw a group of kids in little vests  with their dad when I went and they were adorable. It is muddy during the winter season so I advise you wear shoes that you won't mind getting dirty.I didn't get to explore the entire park and simply went to the top to see the tree and the view. It was worth it and amazing. Dogs are allowed as long as they are on leashes and there is a bench where the tree is if you decide you want to sit down on something other than the tree.I don't get how people  manage to sit near the tip of the branch. You all are intense tree-climbers  ( in which I am not). Definitely a good place to immerse yourself in forestry. It is beautiful even in the fog.
What a fantastic, underrated hike in SF! The panoramic, unobstructed views of the bay and the city are incredible. We started our hike on the unmarked trail off of Dalewood Way, and during the initial hike you'll forget you're in the city. We hiked through eucalyptus forests lined with vibrant green ferns and ivy. Once you circle around the ridge you'll be surprised with a glimpse of the bay, and as you continue your hike up the view gets even better. This hike is a round trip 1.5 miles. It's a moderate, pretty quick hike and it's definitely worth the view from the highest peak in SF (938 ft). Don't forget to bring your dog because this place is dog-friendly, but leashes required.
One of the most underrated spots in the city. The 103-foot white cross at the top has a ton of history over the Easter Sunday of the mid-20th century, and of course you should go for your picture of #thatSFtree with an amazing overlook of the city at large, as well as views over the East Bay and south towards San Bruno. You can easily spy on people at the top of Twin Peaks and near the Sutro Tower too! Easy climbs to the top.
it's a remarkable spot you could see entire downtown already has expanded over the years to Sue's of different path you could go and view 360° view of San Francisco
Easy hike! Took my parents along and it was short. Took about half an hour each way. There's a giant cross you can visit or there is a dead tree which people like to take pictures with. This place has an awesome lookout of the city. One of the highest spots in San Francisco. You can even see where twin peaks is located at. Dogs are allowed too! Just keep an eye on them.
Definitely worth a stroll up if you're in the neighborhood! There are entrances all around the base of the mountain and they're all different. Some are winding and wooded, others are large enough for a vehicle and climb right to the top. The further uphill your trail entrance, the easier the hike will be. If you want more of a challenge, look for a trail near the bottom. I started at the bottom, came out near the top and it took an hour, including photographs. There are so many side trails thought that you could spend a lot more time wandering around if you wanted to. In general, trails that go more or less straight will take you around the mount to see all the different views. But be warned that this trail was narrow and rocky at times. It does require that you pay attention and be careful. There are others that split off and go up to the top or down to the bottom in a more direct route. You'll get to the top regardless and there are wonderful picture views up there.
This park gives an amazing view of the city! It's a very short and easy stroll to the top. I almost felt bad for looking at such an amazing view when I didn't even have to walk that much to get there.There is a cool looking dead tree at the top where people sometimes climb and take photos. On the other side of the park (this depends on where you start walking up) there is a cross.
Mt Davidson has views that are as great as Twin Peaks but without the crowds. Like Bernal Heights the only way to get up here is to walk. But in this case you'll be hiking up through trees. The view only appears at the top where it will surprise you - along with the giant cross.Many people don't know about the giant cross because it faces southwest so it's not visible from the center of town. It's a massive monument to the Armenian genocide in Turkey. Apparently it was also featured in Dirty Harry.Now that I've been up Mt Davidson I've finally covered the "the Seven Hills of San Francisco"(Telegraph Hill, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, Rincon Hill, Mount Sutro, Twin Peaks and Mount Davidson). It only took me 9 years!
The views are great up here. You have a great view of Twin Peaks and Sutro Tower in addition to a panoramic view of San Francisco and the neighborhoods South/West of town. The giant cross is a nice monument and its location back in the woods is a great spot for some quiet reflection. Now I notice the cross all the time poking up just above the trees.I think I took the hard way up, it made for a tough but short hike through the woods from the North side of the park.
We visited on a foggy/drizzly weekday morning in late February & had the entire place to ourselves.  The relatively short (approx 1-mile round trip) & easy walk up was quiet except for the many birds, whose various calls & fluttering about actually added to the overall peaceful atmosphere of the morning.  When we reached the top, the panoramic view of the city was unsurprisingly obscured by fog, but that was beautiful in it's own SF kind of way.  A little bit farther uphill & a bit into the woods, the enormous cross rises up.  It's much larger in person than I expected.  And in the quiet, gloomy morning, against the fog, the towering cross can be a tad intimidating.There are several smaller, beautiful, verdant paths near the monument, one in particular with stone steps, that is definitely worth exploring.  But the coolest thing you should know about Mount Davidson is the "Ransom Run" scene in Dirty Harry was filmed here! youtu.be/soZZ_agKT8E  I really enjoyed this park; it's really beautiful & part of SF iconic film history.  Highly recommend if you're in the area!
Highest natural point in San Francisco? This place is a really nice place for pictures and a breath of fresh air, but it is no hike. There's two places you can start from, either from the bottom of the forest or near the bus stop in the back. Walking from the bottom during a foggy day makes you feel like you've stepped into another world away from SF. Overgrowth on tall trees with rays of sunlight piercing the thick fog and tree canopy. My ideal type of hike right there. I came in from the back with a couple of friends. If you walk a few minutes up, you're already there. Views you can see from here are the Sutro Tower, Twin Peaks, and the entire eastern half of San Francisco. Honestly I think views on Grand View Park or Twin Peaks have nicer panoramic views of the city, but I loved it here too.Definitely come here for the giant cross, and the famous fallen tree! The cross is massive in size, and the tree is fun for climbing. Great photo opportunities all around. You might need a buddy to help you to sit on top of the branch. Trust me the branches are more than sturdy enough for the average guy.
FYI this is not really a hike. I don't know where we got the idea that it was, but we made the effort to wake up early on a Saturday, came fully geared and ready to sweat, only to take a 15 minute stroll straight to the top. In this kind of situation, you can't even pretend it was a workout.  Nevertheless, it was a beautiful panoramic view of the entire city and most definitely worth it. Considering how easy it is to get here, I can see why it's a destination for so many photographers. And as predicted, we did see someone with a tripod at the top.If anything, Mount Davidson is probably better for a run since there are multiple short trails around the park. It wasn't that crowded (even for a Saturday!) so this might just be the perfect escape from the pedestrian-filled sidewalks and roads of SF! Plus it's always nice to go running somewhere with a view!
A great spot for hiking!! It was pretty cold and gloomy when we went, which I think is the perfect weather to hike. It's a small walk uphill and once you get to the top, the view is amazing! The pictures definitely don't do it justice. You get a 360 view of the entire city!! Once you walk into the woods, you'll find a huge cross. It's a monument for the Armenian genocide. It's a really cool sight, surrounded by the trees. There are little trails within the woods so you can do some exploring. I highly recommend it if you're in SF!
This place isn't really a hike, but it is a nice walk and a nice place to take photos of SF since you can see the downtown area from far away. It gets chilly while walking uphill and I went the day after it rained, so the floor was super muddy and wet still. The huge cross was tall and dirty, and it's amazing how the monument lasts so long throughout these years. Very cool cross though! I also walked towards the famous tree with multiple branches sticking out. It's a struggle to get on the branch and sit on top of the branch, but it's doable! Just need to use them abs and have a person help out. The branches are really smooth so you can't really fall. I was scared cause to me it seemed really high up! This park is a nice place to just chill and I recommend tourists to come see the cross.
Great hike with a very beautiful view of the city. Be careful on the trails as the rocks are a bit slippery at some points. There is a nice tree on the top of the hill for pictures. Climbing the tree is easy but getting off may be a bit tricky. In my experience, the best way is to slide it down. Yes, slide down the tree. It may sound a bit crazy, but it works. Above the hill with the tree is the giant cross. This hike has several trails that all lead to the top. If the path splits off and you are not sure if it is a trail then do not go on it. It will most likely lead to a dead end and you will have to go back. DO NOT go off the trail and try to create your own shortcut. There are a bunch of thorns everywhere and you will only be hurting yourself and nature. I had a friend who did that because he went off on a trail that led to a dead end and tried to make a shortcut back to the main trail. He came back with cuts everywhere. Overall, an easy hike if you stick on the main trail and always go up. Also, this hike could definitely benefit from having signs.
Nice hike to top of the highest natural point in Bay Area and the Mount Davidson memorial cross. Near panoramic views. Multiple back dirt trails. Caution, slippery after rain.(This entry written by husband)
I absolutely love coming to this beautiful sight! It only takes about 15 minutes to walk to the top, plus it's all shaded by trees. There's also plenty of parking by the street entrance, and the parking is pretty much flat. I highly recommend wearing layers because it's very windy at the top of the mountain! Also, don't even try wearing a hat.
Something worth depriving sleep over. Woke up at 5:15 and caught a Lyft line here for $11. One mistake I did do was actually do a actual legit hike up the mountain versus knowing that there was a straight shot up the mountain on the other side near the bus stop. We had to use your iPhone lights to guide ourselves up at such a early morning time with it being dark out and foggy. But when we get up there it was well worth the hike and exercise. Do some research on iPhone as to when is the actual sunrise for the best views. I recommended getting 15-20 minutes there prior get a couple of use one with the nightlights still over San Francisco and a couple of the sunrise,All in all I think this is a must do for all visitors into San Francisco.
