Moon is the best piano teacher ive had so far. she always inspires me to keep practicing and she really tailors her lesson to my learning style. yee moon you rock!
I highly recommend Moon ! Not only is she knowledgeble, patient and caring, but she knows her stuff and her method of teaching is great !!! And she is very reasonbale as far as the fee's are concerned ! You will not find a teahcer like Moon in SF !!! Two thumbs up Moon ! I xcan tell I h ave already progressed !
The most inexpensive private piano lesson but also the most efficiently tailored for each individual needs. Â All music score books are available to learn.
