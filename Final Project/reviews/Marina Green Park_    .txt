I enjoy taking a walk in the early morning hours during the weekend here. Seeing the Golden Gate bridge and Marin headlands in the distance really brings a calm to a very busy and hectic work week in SF. Great place to jog, you will see many other joggers in the area so you are not totally alone. The Safeway in the area is convenient if you are looking for water or sports drink. If you are bringing kids to this park you would have to keep a good eye on them if they like getting into everything. There isn't a railing on the promenade, it is very easy for children to fall into the water or on the rocks below.
Love San Francisco!A lot of events happen here, lots of different people come stroll, run or bike here. And this is one of the few places where I can take my dog unleashed. I envy the people living so close by. I really hope they're taking advantage of it big time. View of the water. Alcatraz. Go north and the Golden Gate Bridge is there.  Or just simply sit on the grass and people watch or contemplate on how awesome your life is. Beautiful!
Super cute little park with a fantastic view of the ocean shoreline beach and Alcatraz island which makes the trip worth it.
When the weather is good this is a great place to jog.  One of the last areas in sf with free parking!  Off the grid right next door @ fort mason is a plus.
Marina Green is such a respite from the daily grind of work...it is truly a gift to all that visit and live here.I always love walking my dog here, taking a run, whipping out the Mountain bike or showing visitors what all the hype of this here ol city is all about...and yeah they get it after visiting the Marina Green.I also love the vibrancy of all the people that use the Green. Lots of great looking ladies (and gentlemen) out for a bike ride or a run. People will always give you a smile, a hello, or a brief nod....that means a lot.Great for a picnic as well.
I've been going here since I was 2 yrs old. This is a place to really take it all in and relax. Easy jog, friendly face, and always easy on the eyes. The sound of the boats rocking and the waves hitting the rocks is so soothing. The park is pet friendly and definitely a go to for pick up soccer games, flagball, flying kites,or throwing a frisbee. The golden gate bridge is a head turn away and any picture you take is golden. The palace of fine arts is around the corner and the entirety of the view really puts a smile on your face. Be sure to be on the lookout for events in Fort mason and on the green there are some activities that people conjur up for the public. There are stations along the tracks to keep you motivated to do other exercises and they have a newer resistance training/gymnastics type area for those who want to add a little extra to their workout. Have fun! It definitely brings out some of the purity of an amazing city.
74 acres of Joy !Easy , and lots of parking along Marina Green Drive, I think of this as a playground for adults, where you can play Vollyball, Touch Football, Frisbee, Run, Bike, Train, or maybe ,,,Join in with so many of the others, and Fly a Kite, put out a Blanket and enjoy some food and wine with friends, or maybe share your wine , and make some new friends Locals mostly , but also a great place to relax and enjoy yourself if visiting
Great place to come with friends and family. Got to get here early for good parking though...
Love reading here while staring at the gorgeous bridge
Time: 10:57amPurpose: My regular weekend runs or bike.Venue: City parkCleanliness: One of the cleanest in the city. Park workers are out in their vehicles doing their task cleaning,scrubbing,dumping anything that's is not resourceful is out of there.Punch Line: Plenty of parking from Fort mason to Crissy fields just make sure you don't park in a business lot or else you will be tow at your expenses to get it back. Can see Alcatraz island aka (the rock),GGB,San Rafael/Richmond bridge,amazing views of marin county,couple of sporting good stores with area,palace of fine arts,trendy shop in the marina shopping district, well known eateries,a walk to end of GGB reveals historic armory forts etc. Dogs permitted leash is required year round,presideo marsh,st. francis yacht club, and the famous wave organ that SF natives goes to when meditation kicks in.Final Thoughts: It's beautiful here on the weekends runners,joggers,kites,cycling,nature watching,pinics,cross training groups,soccer,flag football, beach front etc. There are different varieties of activities to keep you entertain and pass time. One word of caution is never leave personal belongings in car even with magnet box that surfers use to hide car keys. Lastly sneaker waves can really come up quietly when you're least expecting it.
I usually go on marina green with my friends. I think it's great place in the city. It's have everything,: fresh air, sun and spectacular views of golden gate bridge.
When the weather is great, no better place for a jog or stroll. The aptly named green will blind your eyes with its verdant hue, as will the abundance of yoga pants.
Went again. First of all, we forgot that we visit this place years ago, didn't bring heavy jackets with us, wow, it was a cold day!  Not much to do over there.
A green oasis exists in San Francisco?Yes, and the MGP is one of them...Actually, the City has quite a few mother-nature gems. It's a beautiful place that is easily accessible. On my last visit, I saw humans: walking, jogging/running, skateboarding, roller-skating, bicycling, unicycling, sailing (including Oracle Team USA in the America's Cup), boardsailing, picnicking, eating, sleeping, and... well you get the picture.The last several days of this writing have been perfect SF weather, where there is very little fog rolling in and the winds are kept to a minimum with temperature up in the high 60F.  Further down, you can stroll towards Crissy Fields and enjoy a nice of view of the Golden Gate Bridge.Beware:  there is a Dynamo Coffee and Donuts stand nearby, so it may destroy what precious calories you burned off if you were active. That's exactly what happened to me. Enjoy!
This really is as good as it gets!  The views are incredible; Alcatraz, the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond!  Plenty of free parking and nice paths to walk on and benches to sit and enjoy the view.  Everyone should put this on their list of places to visit in San Francisco.
This park is cool and laid back. Every time I pass by I see people and dogs loving life and having fun.People playing beer kickball, sunbathing, bike riding, etc. Great place for a picnic with Safeway & Starbucks across the street.I usually grab a latte, sit out here and read/ people watch & I couldn't be happier.
The views alone are enough to take you aback with their beauty.  Winding trailsways for running... open fields for flying a kite.  This is what life is all about.  Appreciating what nature has to offer.I try to get here once every visit to San Fran, even if it's just driving by on the way to Napa or whatever.  The entire area is just awe inspiring and scenic.  Makes me jealous of all the people who live nearby and can take advantage of the park everyday! lol!If you have never been, go!  It's a must :)
The Marina Green is a 74-acre expanse of grass between Fort Mason and the Presidio. The views of the Bay and the various fellow citizens who enjoy this Park are outstanding. I also enjoy the houses that line Marina Boulevard across the street. Many of these 1920s/30s vintage houses have large bay windows. Herb Caen, the late San Francisco newspaper columnist, often made references to the immaculate furnishings behind these windows. In the past, a railroad track along the southern edge of the Marina Green allowed the State Belt Railroad to serve the Presidio. Adjacent to the Marina Green is a marina, home to the St. Francis Yacht Club and the Golden Gate Yacht Club.Prior to the 1906 earthquake, this area was a tidal marsh. After the earthquake, much of the resulting rubble was dumped here. Later, to provide land for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, this site and the adjacent Marina neighborhood was filled in. A nearby remnant of the Exposition is the restored Palace of Fine Arts.This is also a wonderful place to hang out on the grass for hours on end and enjoy the kites and the ocean breezes. I've also participated in running events where Marina Green was the starting and ending point. And that scenery certain helped me finish the race. Parking is hit or miss and picnic snacks (and potential dates if you're so inclined) are available at the nearby Safeway.
On a clear day in the city, you really can't beat loitering around Marina Green for hours on end. You won't find young fellows slinging THC laced desserts or American Apparel junkies playing polo atop their fixed gear bicycles, but what you will find are sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as some of the best looking 20 and 30 somethings this end of town has to offer.It's best to plop down in the early afternoon, as it takes a bit for the water that's collected on the lawn overnight to warm up and evaporate into the earth's vast atmosphere. If you go any earlier, you're a prime target for swamp ass as your bum gets a healthy dose of H2O that won't easily melt away. Hit "Dateway" across the street for sandwiches and adult libations (but you didn't hear that from me), and prepare for a sweet sunburn once that helium laced star makes one of its rare appearances around foggy San Francisco.
I practically live here.Every week I come here to run or meet up with Fleet Feet Sunset Runs. Love everything about this place.I wish I lived across the street. :) I love the vibe and especially seeing runners, bikers, strollers and walkers. It just made me love San Francisco more because I get to drive to the marina and run.

When the weather is great, no better place for a jog or stroll. The aptly named green will blind your eyes with its verdant hue, as will the abundance of yoga pants.
Went again. First of all, we forgot that we visit this place years ago, didn't bring heavy jackets with us, wow, it was a cold day!  Not much to do over there.
A green oasis exists in San Francisco?Yes, and the MGP is one of them...Actually, the City has quite a few mother-nature gems. It's a beautiful place that is easily accessible. On my last visit, I saw humans: walking, jogging/running, skateboarding, roller-skating, bicycling, unicycling, sailing (including Oracle Team USA in the America's Cup), boardsailing, picnicking, eating, sleeping, and... well you get the picture.The last several days of this writing have been perfect SF weather, where there is very little fog rolling in and the winds are kept to a minimum with temperature up in the high 60F.  Further down, you can stroll towards Crissy Fields and enjoy a nice of view of the Golden Gate Bridge.Beware:  there is a Dynamo Coffee and Donuts stand nearby, so it may destroy what precious calories you burned off if you were active. That's exactly what happened to me. Enjoy!
This really is as good as it gets!  The views are incredible; Alcatraz, the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond!  Plenty of free parking and nice paths to walk on and benches to sit and enjoy the view.  Everyone should put this on their list of places to visit in San Francisco.
This park is cool and laid back. Every time I pass by I see people and dogs loving life and having fun.People playing beer kickball, sunbathing, bike riding, etc. Great place for a picnic with Safeway & Starbucks across the street.I usually grab a latte, sit out here and read/ people watch & I couldn't be happier.
The views alone are enough to take you aback with their beauty.  Winding trailsways for running... open fields for flying a kite.  This is what life is all about.  Appreciating what nature has to offer.I try to get here once every visit to San Fran, even if it's just driving by on the way to Napa or whatever.  The entire area is just awe inspiring and scenic.  Makes me jealous of all the people who live nearby and can take advantage of the park everyday! lol!If you have never been, go!  It's a must :)
The Marina Green is a 74-acre expanse of grass between Fort Mason and the Presidio. The views of the Bay and the various fellow citizens who enjoy this Park are outstanding. I also enjoy the houses that line Marina Boulevard across the street. Many of these 1920s/30s vintage houses have large bay windows. Herb Caen, the late San Francisco newspaper columnist, often made references to the immaculate furnishings behind these windows. In the past, a railroad track along the southern edge of the Marina Green allowed the State Belt Railroad to serve the Presidio. Adjacent to the Marina Green is a marina, home to the St. Francis Yacht Club and the Golden Gate Yacht Club.Prior to the 1906 earthquake, this area was a tidal marsh. After the earthquake, much of the resulting rubble was dumped here. Later, to provide land for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, this site and the adjacent Marina neighborhood was filled in. A nearby remnant of the Exposition is the restored Palace of Fine Arts.This is also a wonderful place to hang out on the grass for hours on end and enjoy the kites and the ocean breezes. I've also participated in running events where Marina Green was the starting and ending point. And that scenery certain helped me finish the race. Parking is hit or miss and picnic snacks (and potential dates if you're so inclined) are available at the nearby Safeway.
On a clear day in the city, you really can't beat loitering around Marina Green for hours on end. You won't find young fellows slinging THC laced desserts or American Apparel junkies playing polo atop their fixed gear bicycles, but what you will find are sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as some of the best looking 20 and 30 somethings this end of town has to offer.It's best to plop down in the early afternoon, as it takes a bit for the water that's collected on the lawn overnight to warm up and evaporate into the earth's vast atmosphere. If you go any earlier, you're a prime target for swamp ass as your bum gets a healthy dose of H2O that won't easily melt away. Hit "Dateway" across the street for sandwiches and adult libations (but you didn't hear that from me), and prepare for a sweet sunburn once that helium laced star makes one of its rare appearances around foggy San Francisco.
I practically live here.Every week I come here to run or meet up with Fleet Feet Sunset Runs. Love everything about this place.I wish I lived across the street. :) I love the vibe and especially seeing runners, bikers, strollers and walkers. It just made me love San Francisco more because I get to drive to the marina and run.
