I freaking love some good wings, and the wings were freaking good. We ordered Green (cilantro, jalepeno ginger sesame oil mix), Korean (house gochujang hot peppers), and Chris's (honey salty crispy black pepper). All three are considered their top sellers, and they were all delicious. I generally don't like too much pepper in my food, but I think Chris's was my favorite out of the three. Honestly, it's really hard to pick a favorite.The chicken was perfectly cooked throughout, not dry at all, and the outside was a good amount of crispy.The place is very tiny. There are two tables-for-two inside and a table outside that can fit four people comfortably. We ended up taking our to-go and eating it in the car. The kitchen is essentially open so you can see what's going on back there. They have shelves stocked with a bunch of sauces that you can purchase. I've never seen so many sauces for wings in my life. The wait was fairly short with a few people in front of us. Finding parking is a tad bit difficult but no surprise there. Really sad that I can't find any wings like these in Texas. I can only dream of the day I return to Hot Sauce and Panko for more delicious wings.
The chicken wings taste good but there are some factors that frustrate me about this place and leave me with a bad feeling;- The chicken wings are frozen - When asking for water the answer was "you can only buy it". Really? Is that even legal in California? - hardly opportunity to sit down & eat
These are exceptionally good wings. I had the Garlic Bacon Parmesan, Chase's, and Korean and all three were great in their own way. They were cooked perfectly, with a slight crunch on the outside but very juicy on the inside. I also really appreciated how saucy they were - there was enough sauce to coat the wings, but they weren't dripping and messy.My only complaint is they weren't as big as I had hoped. That's not to say that they were extremely small, but they would have been perfect if there was a bit more meat.
WINGS.You don't know how glad I am to hear that they moved locations. Not sure if it was true or not, but the yelp account for the old location said they used to only open two days a week 12-6pm. Who actually has time for that?! Anyways, I've heard people mention this place here and there, so let's see what the fuss is about. Came here around 5:30pm, and I expected it to be on the front of a busier street. Nothing much around except for a Craftsman & Wolves 2 blocks down. It's a corner shop with literally no seating. There's two small high tables inside, but they're more for customers to chill and wait for their order to be ready for pickup. A really small store means it's more of a to-go type of business, but seriously, where is there to go nearby except for a couple of alright cafes?  Service is quick, and what's unique is that they give you a toy block instead of a number. So cool! They even advertise a lot of bottled sauce on standing racks to the side, assuming they use a majority of those in their recipe. 6 wings for about $6 a set. Must order each flavor as a set of 6, no adjustments.FOODKorean: (5/5) These wings were tasty! Wasn't spicy really, but they're better than a lot of wings out there. I like the fact that they garnish with a dash of sesame seeds on top. Makes it look a lot more appetizing.Chris: (5/5) MY FAVORITE WINGS. SWEET AND SAVORY. The sauce is light and peppery, and I just couldn't get enough of these! These are on another level away from San Tung's, so it's not really comparable. Get these!Thai: (5/5) These were really good too! I love the sweet and sour chili sauce taste with a heavy scent of basil. Too good to pass up.Man all there wings are so good that I just gotta try everything else!
Take out review. Chris' (Honey salty crispy black pepper) - 4/5Panko parmesan - 5/5Garlic bacon parmesan - 4/5Chicken waffle gravy open sandwich - 2/5Overall, "as good as it gets."
For those who consider wings a core food group (I know there's more of you out there, don't lie), this is your heaven on Earth. The Outer Richmond location was a tough one to get to but now that it's smack dab on Hyde & Jackson, it's become a regular haunt. Most of the flavors are wildly inventive and embrace fusion like no one's business. Think ramen-encrusted, sriracha, pesto, gochujang, etc. If you're "waffling" (har dee har har), you can't go wrong with Chris's - honey black pepper, Green - jalapaneo & cilantro, and Lime - caramelized fish sauce. They're on the smaller side as wings go but they pack a mighty flavor and are always beautifully crispy and juicy. The waffles and fries are more of a very quiet sidekick than anything else. Tips:- Order in via phone so it's ready for you when you get there. The line gets ridiculous around lunch time and near EOD since they close pretty early.- There's nowhere to sit inside so plan to take it on the road.- Take home one of the jaw dropping collections of unique hot sauces on the wall, the other half of their namesake.
Stopped by here late afternoon hoping to get some amazing fried chicken wings. The shop was super tiny with only 2 tables and a couple standing table outside. When you walk in, you're greeted by an array of hot sauces. I ordered a couple spicy ones and they were pretty tasty. I docked one star because for it being too sweet and not really that spicy.Overall, great place to grab a quick bite. Definitely recommend!
May be the best chicken wings I have ever had! But maybe that's not saying much as I really don't go to chicken wing places... Other than BDubs. This little corner shop in SF is a teeny tiny space where basically you go in and order at the counter. Most people do take out and wait outside, but there are 2 standing tables if you want to eat immediately (which we opted to do). A little claustrophobic but it'll get the job done.I tried a whole bunch of wings but definitely recommend the green, ramen, and Korean. Waffles were OK. But personally I was a huge fan of the decor of hilarious posters/paintings around the restaurant. And even though they seemed to be pretty busy, the orders still came out pretty fast.Check this place out! You won't be disappointed.
These wings are HELLA good!  Their hours are a bit odd, one time I was waiting in my car instead of going to their door saying "open, open, open".  Didn't want to seem annoying or creepy over some chicken wings LOL!  But hot daaaaayyyyyyuuuummmm!!!They open promptly at noon Wed-Fri and close at 6pm, except on Sundays when they close at 5pm.  Closed Monday & Tuesday, bizarre for an Asian place...whatever, it just means we get to crave it more.  I'm totally addicted to their Goliath chicken waffle sandwich, which consists of chicken karaage with cabbage sriracha caramel and sushi sauce.  It's worth crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, and it's worth trekking over from Outer Richmond.  Their shelves are stocked with unique hot sauces to purchase, some I've never heard of.  Of course they have "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun hot sauce, my kind of place.  You'll get a kick outta their witty signs, everyone needs a good laugh.  All their wings are tasty; however, they don't let you mix them up...boo!  This place is tiny, not enough tables/seats for more than 5 people.  Unless you want to stand outside, there are two tables.  I'm craving their wings as I type this, too bad it's a Tuesday.  I will have to beat the rush after work to get here since they close at 6pm.
Are they the best wings I've ever had? No, but they're pretty solid. We had like 3 different flavors, and the waffles (yum).They'd run out of fries, but somewhere in the back they had tots so we went for that.. and those are bomb. I mean, you think you can't mess up fried potato but people do screw it up all time. These tots were fried to perfection.Annoying to have to wait sooooo long in this lil space but at least you don't have to hoof it to the Richmond for these anymore.
We came back for another round of wings and this time we decided to try some different flavors!Last time, we ordered the Chris's and Garlic Parm (mmmm all that bacon!) which were two solid flavors. This time, we ordered Green (which they ran out of last time) and Korean. Personally, I preferred CHRIS'S much better and I can def say that's my fav so far!My ranking of what we've tried so far: 1) Chris's - A little on the sweeter side but sooooo good! It's a "honey salty crispy black pepper" wing and all the flavors just come together so well!2) Garlic Bacon Parm - All those bacon bits?! Bursting with garlic and parmesan flavor and overloaded with bacon. Definitely a crowd-pleaser.3) Korean - House Gochujang Hot Pepper. This wasn't as spicy as I initially thought it was going to be, but it was alright.4) Green - Cilantro Jalapeno Ginger Sesame Oil Spice Mix. I had high expectations for this!! But was semi-disappointed. I thought there was going to be a bigger kick from the jalapeno or something, but all I could really taste was the ginger and sesame oil (kinda?). More of a mellow wing.
Flavorful. Crispy skin. Juicy meat. What more can you ask for? I tried the Parmesan Panko, Chris' and Thai chicken wings with an extra waffle. I could not believe how crispy the crust was on the Parmesan Panko. It was crispy all around! Unlike some wings that get soggy on the side it was sitting on. Also, it paired perfectly with the ranch-Sriracha sauce. PP was my personal favorite and every time I go back I will order again. Chris' had a honey-salty flavor and it was my family's favorite flavor. I liked the Thai when I first bit into it but by my third wing, I was getting sick of the flavor and ended up not finishing that batch. I ordered everything to go and was surprised that they were still crispy by the time I got home! Wow!
Hot Sauce and Panko... how do you get your wings so perfectly crispy on the outside, and amazingly tender on the inside? Seriously.These wings don't look like much on the outside (I mean, wings rarely do), but they're seriously some of the best wings I've ever had. To avoid waiting - call in your order, then go pick it up. You can't sit there if you order to-go, but I typically just pick up my wings, and walk (ok SPRINT) home.Make sure to try the ramen rings. Although the coating of my ramen wings weren't to ramen noodle-like, they were the perfect, dry exterior to counterbalance the juicy moist interior. Must try!!
I start off by mentioning that I love chicken wings.  Any time I can try a new wing place or just wings in general I most certainly take advantage of it.  Now with that out of the way, this place has the best wings I have ever had.  You're probably thinking that's a bold statement but after trying his place several times this place has become my all time favorite place for wings.This place is a super hole in the wall place with tons of different sauces to try but being that I love spicy things I went with a 6 piece mango habanero.  It's no where near as spicy as the mango habanero from Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop, think more along the lines of Dominos.  It's has a nice kick, but really captures the sweetness from the mango.  I definitely recommend this if you want a less spicy flavorful sauce.  But besides the great sauces, I've tried a few, the wings are so tender that it blows my mind how wings can be so delicious.  I've honestly never had wings even remotely close to the consistency as the ones here.  Along with wings they also have friend chicken and waffle sandwich.  Yup, it's just as delicious as it sounds.  For $7 you're getting your monies worth.  Inside of it comes with some coleslaw, Sriracha, a huge piece of fried chicken and some syrup on the side.  The fried chicken is nice battered, but doesn't crumble and make a mess when you bite into it.  If you're a fan of wings they you seriously have to try this place.  Already looking forward to my next SF trip so that can come back here for wings.
I discovered this place back when it was out in the richmond & since moving back downtown I couldn't be more stoked that it's moved. Only thing more exciting is these ramen wings. I'm dead.
i used to come to hot sauce and panko a lot when i was still living in the richmond district. their chicken wings are so delicious! they recently moved locations to nob hill so i decided to stop by for some of their delicious chicken wings. their popular items are KFC (korean fried chicken), green, and chris's honey salty crispy black pepper wings. my group and i decided to order the KFC, green, chris's honey salty crispy black pepper, and garlic bacon parmesan wings.KFC: (5/5) it's a little bit spicy (this is coming from someone who can't handle spicy), but it tastes really good.green: (3/5) i don't think i like these wings as much as i used to. maybe there was too much cilantro added to it.chris's honey salty crispy black pepper: (5/5) honey + crispy = amazinggarlic bacon parmesan: (5/5) garlic + bacon + parmesan = heaven. three of my favorite items combined!!!notes: parking is pretty bad here, so make sure you know where to park or avoid driving at all.  there's no sit down area to eat your food so you're gonna have to take it to go. i recommend the belgian waffle! this place is amazing! you need to try their wings. their flavors are very unique but a bit pricey.
Two words: GHOST PEPPER!!!!  Tried the Chris's, Thai Sweet Chili, Mango Habanero and Greens. The Ghost Pepper was the best spicy goodness!!!! All the other flavors weren't spicy at all from a scale of mild (1)-spicy(10) ghost pepper was like a 8-9. The rest I would say land between 3-4. Waffles were delicious especially with Marion berry syrup.
One rainy afternoon, my friend and I wanted some chicken wings - we were making dinner, but we had both not really eaten all day. Since we were going to get groceries in the Inner Richmond and then head towards the Outer Sunset, it was perfect. No real parking on a Sunday afternoon, but that's okay. I went in and grabbed those chicken wings and he drove around until I was done.  We got 2 different types since there are ONLY small plates now instead of large ones. We got the Chris's honey salted pepper wings (MY FAVE) and the KFC. The Korean Fried Chicken wings were a bit too spicy for me to enjoy that much. They were spicy, with no real flavor to me. The other wings were my favorite. Sweet, salty and a little bit of spicy - just how I like my wings (and myself ;)). The area is small so don't expect to get any seating (if you do, you're lucky!). Super easy to order and take them to go.  Protip: parking is difficult in at times. Definitely order the honey salted pepper wings. BEST.
The wings at Hot Sauce and Panko are unreal. I consider myself a connoisseur of chicken wings and these are the best chicken wings on the west coast. I hsve tried for 9 years to find a good wing place and nowhere in SF bcompares to HS+P. They have a seemingly endless offering of different sauces too, some ambitious some traditional. The waffle is also delicious. Bummed U-Lee is gone but this is a great replacement.
I came to the new location (located on the corner of Jackson & Hyde in Nob Hill) this past weekend and am so happy about the new addition to the neighborhood.Food: I got the Yaki (Teriyaki) Wings & my bf got the Beer Wings and we split an order of fries. Soooo delicious and I cannot wait to try their other flavors. Service: We came about 30 mins before closing & had to wait ~25 minutes to get our food, which was surprising since it wasn't that crowded. There were people who came & ordered after us and received their food first, but it wasn't too big of a deal since we weren't in a huge rush.Ambiance: Definitely a grab-and-go place. There is no outside seating at the new location & only 2 tables inside (both of which are standing-only tables and would be really inconvenient to sit at if it was crowded).

The chicken wings taste good but there are some factors that frustrate me about this place and leave me with a bad feeling;- The chicken wings are frozen - When asking for water the answer was "you can only buy it". Really? Is that even legal in California? - hardly opportunity to sit down & eat
These are exceptionally good wings. I had the Garlic Bacon Parmesan, Chase's, and Korean and all three were great in their own way. They were cooked perfectly, with a slight crunch on the outside but very juicy on the inside. I also really appreciated how saucy they were - there was enough sauce to coat the wings, but they weren't dripping and messy.My only complaint is they weren't as big as I had hoped. That's not to say that they were extremely small, but they would have been perfect if there was a bit more meat.
WINGS.You don't know how glad I am to hear that they moved locations. Not sure if it was true or not, but the yelp account for the old location said they used to only open two days a week 12-6pm. Who actually has time for that?! Anyways, I've heard people mention this place here and there, so let's see what the fuss is about. Came here around 5:30pm, and I expected it to be on the front of a busier street. Nothing much around except for a Craftsman & Wolves 2 blocks down. It's a corner shop with literally no seating. There's two small high tables inside, but they're more for customers to chill and wait for their order to be ready for pickup. A really small store means it's more of a to-go type of business, but seriously, where is there to go nearby except for a couple of alright cafes?  Service is quick, and what's unique is that they give you a toy block instead of a number. So cool! They even advertise a lot of bottled sauce on standing racks to the side, assuming they use a majority of those in their recipe. 6 wings for about $6 a set. Must order each flavor as a set of 6, no adjustments.FOODKorean: (5/5) These wings were tasty! Wasn't spicy really, but they're better than a lot of wings out there. I like the fact that they garnish with a dash of sesame seeds on top. Makes it look a lot more appetizing.Chris: (5/5) MY FAVORITE WINGS. SWEET AND SAVORY. The sauce is light and peppery, and I just couldn't get enough of these! These are on another level away from San Tung's, so it's not really comparable. Get these!Thai: (5/5) These were really good too! I love the sweet and sour chili sauce taste with a heavy scent of basil. Too good to pass up.Man all there wings are so good that I just gotta try everything else!
Take out review. Chris' (Honey salty crispy black pepper) - 4/5Panko parmesan - 5/5Garlic bacon parmesan - 4/5Chicken waffle gravy open sandwich - 2/5Overall, "as good as it gets."
For those who consider wings a core food group (I know there's more of you out there, don't lie), this is your heaven on Earth. The Outer Richmond location was a tough one to get to but now that it's smack dab on Hyde & Jackson, it's become a regular haunt. Most of the flavors are wildly inventive and embrace fusion like no one's business. Think ramen-encrusted, sriracha, pesto, gochujang, etc. If you're "waffling" (har dee har har), you can't go wrong with Chris's - honey black pepper, Green - jalapaneo & cilantro, and Lime - caramelized fish sauce. They're on the smaller side as wings go but they pack a mighty flavor and are always beautifully crispy and juicy. The waffles and fries are more of a very quiet sidekick than anything else. Tips:- Order in via phone so it's ready for you when you get there. The line gets ridiculous around lunch time and near EOD since they close pretty early.- There's nowhere to sit inside so plan to take it on the road.- Take home one of the jaw dropping collections of unique hot sauces on the wall, the other half of their namesake.
Stopped by here late afternoon hoping to get some amazing fried chicken wings. The shop was super tiny with only 2 tables and a couple standing table outside. When you walk in, you're greeted by an array of hot sauces. I ordered a couple spicy ones and they were pretty tasty. I docked one star because for it being too sweet and not really that spicy.Overall, great place to grab a quick bite. Definitely recommend!
May be the best chicken wings I have ever had! But maybe that's not saying much as I really don't go to chicken wing places... Other than BDubs. This little corner shop in SF is a teeny tiny space where basically you go in and order at the counter. Most people do take out and wait outside, but there are 2 standing tables if you want to eat immediately (which we opted to do). A little claustrophobic but it'll get the job done.I tried a whole bunch of wings but definitely recommend the green, ramen, and Korean. Waffles were OK. But personally I was a huge fan of the decor of hilarious posters/paintings around the restaurant. And even though they seemed to be pretty busy, the orders still came out pretty fast.Check this place out! You won't be disappointed.
These wings are HELLA good!  Their hours are a bit odd, one time I was waiting in my car instead of going to their door saying "open, open, open".  Didn't want to seem annoying or creepy over some chicken wings LOL!  But hot daaaaayyyyyyuuuummmm!!!They open promptly at noon Wed-Fri and close at 6pm, except on Sundays when they close at 5pm.  Closed Monday & Tuesday, bizarre for an Asian place...whatever, it just means we get to crave it more.  I'm totally addicted to their Goliath chicken waffle sandwich, which consists of chicken karaage with cabbage sriracha caramel and sushi sauce.  It's worth crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, and it's worth trekking over from Outer Richmond.  Their shelves are stocked with unique hot sauces to purchase, some I've never heard of.  Of course they have "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun hot sauce, my kind of place.  You'll get a kick outta their witty signs, everyone needs a good laugh.  All their wings are tasty; however, they don't let you mix them up...boo!  This place is tiny, not enough tables/seats for more than 5 people.  Unless you want to stand outside, there are two tables.  I'm craving their wings as I type this, too bad it's a Tuesday.  I will have to beat the rush after work to get here since they close at 6pm.
Are they the best wings I've ever had? No, but they're pretty solid. We had like 3 different flavors, and the waffles (yum).They'd run out of fries, but somewhere in the back they had tots so we went for that.. and those are bomb. I mean, you think you can't mess up fried potato but people do screw it up all time. These tots were fried to perfection.Annoying to have to wait sooooo long in this lil space but at least you don't have to hoof it to the Richmond for these anymore.
We came back for another round of wings and this time we decided to try some different flavors!Last time, we ordered the Chris's and Garlic Parm (mmmm all that bacon!) which were two solid flavors. This time, we ordered Green (which they ran out of last time) and Korean. Personally, I preferred CHRIS'S much better and I can def say that's my fav so far!My ranking of what we've tried so far: 1) Chris's - A little on the sweeter side but sooooo good! It's a "honey salty crispy black pepper" wing and all the flavors just come together so well!2) Garlic Bacon Parm - All those bacon bits?! Bursting with garlic and parmesan flavor and overloaded with bacon. Definitely a crowd-pleaser.3) Korean - House Gochujang Hot Pepper. This wasn't as spicy as I initially thought it was going to be, but it was alright.4) Green - Cilantro Jalapeno Ginger Sesame Oil Spice Mix. I had high expectations for this!! But was semi-disappointed. I thought there was going to be a bigger kick from the jalapeno or something, but all I could really taste was the ginger and sesame oil (kinda?). More of a mellow wing.
Flavorful. Crispy skin. Juicy meat. What more can you ask for? I tried the Parmesan Panko, Chris' and Thai chicken wings with an extra waffle. I could not believe how crispy the crust was on the Parmesan Panko. It was crispy all around! Unlike some wings that get soggy on the side it was sitting on. Also, it paired perfectly with the ranch-Sriracha sauce. PP was my personal favorite and every time I go back I will order again. Chris' had a honey-salty flavor and it was my family's favorite flavor. I liked the Thai when I first bit into it but by my third wing, I was getting sick of the flavor and ended up not finishing that batch. I ordered everything to go and was surprised that they were still crispy by the time I got home! Wow!
Hot Sauce and Panko... how do you get your wings so perfectly crispy on the outside, and amazingly tender on the inside? Seriously.These wings don't look like much on the outside (I mean, wings rarely do), but they're seriously some of the best wings I've ever had. To avoid waiting - call in your order, then go pick it up. You can't sit there if you order to-go, but I typically just pick up my wings, and walk (ok SPRINT) home.Make sure to try the ramen rings. Although the coating of my ramen wings weren't to ramen noodle-like, they were the perfect, dry exterior to counterbalance the juicy moist interior. Must try!!
I start off by mentioning that I love chicken wings.  Any time I can try a new wing place or just wings in general I most certainly take advantage of it.  Now with that out of the way, this place has the best wings I have ever had.  You're probably thinking that's a bold statement but after trying his place several times this place has become my all time favorite place for wings.This place is a super hole in the wall place with tons of different sauces to try but being that I love spicy things I went with a 6 piece mango habanero.  It's no where near as spicy as the mango habanero from Buffalo Wild Wings or Wingstop, think more along the lines of Dominos.  It's has a nice kick, but really captures the sweetness from the mango.  I definitely recommend this if you want a less spicy flavorful sauce.  But besides the great sauces, I've tried a few, the wings are so tender that it blows my mind how wings can be so delicious.  I've honestly never had wings even remotely close to the consistency as the ones here.  Along with wings they also have friend chicken and waffle sandwich.  Yup, it's just as delicious as it sounds.  For $7 you're getting your monies worth.  Inside of it comes with some coleslaw, Sriracha, a huge piece of fried chicken and some syrup on the side.  The fried chicken is nice battered, but doesn't crumble and make a mess when you bite into it.  If you're a fan of wings they you seriously have to try this place.  Already looking forward to my next SF trip so that can come back here for wings.
I discovered this place back when it was out in the richmond & since moving back downtown I couldn't be more stoked that it's moved. Only thing more exciting is these ramen wings. I'm dead.
i used to come to hot sauce and panko a lot when i was still living in the richmond district. their chicken wings are so delicious! they recently moved locations to nob hill so i decided to stop by for some of their delicious chicken wings. their popular items are KFC (korean fried chicken), green, and chris's honey salty crispy black pepper wings. my group and i decided to order the KFC, green, chris's honey salty crispy black pepper, and garlic bacon parmesan wings.KFC: (5/5) it's a little bit spicy (this is coming from someone who can't handle spicy), but it tastes really good.green: (3/5) i don't think i like these wings as much as i used to. maybe there was too much cilantro added to it.chris's honey salty crispy black pepper: (5/5) honey + crispy = amazinggarlic bacon parmesan: (5/5) garlic + bacon + parmesan = heaven. three of my favorite items combined!!!notes: parking is pretty bad here, so make sure you know where to park or avoid driving at all.  there's no sit down area to eat your food so you're gonna have to take it to go. i recommend the belgian waffle! this place is amazing! you need to try their wings. their flavors are very unique but a bit pricey.
Two words: GHOST PEPPER!!!!  Tried the Chris's, Thai Sweet Chili, Mango Habanero and Greens. The Ghost Pepper was the best spicy goodness!!!! All the other flavors weren't spicy at all from a scale of mild (1)-spicy(10) ghost pepper was like a 8-9. The rest I would say land between 3-4. Waffles were delicious especially with Marion berry syrup.
One rainy afternoon, my friend and I wanted some chicken wings - we were making dinner, but we had both not really eaten all day. Since we were going to get groceries in the Inner Richmond and then head towards the Outer Sunset, it was perfect. No real parking on a Sunday afternoon, but that's okay. I went in and grabbed those chicken wings and he drove around until I was done.  We got 2 different types since there are ONLY small plates now instead of large ones. We got the Chris's honey salted pepper wings (MY FAVE) and the KFC. The Korean Fried Chicken wings were a bit too spicy for me to enjoy that much. They were spicy, with no real flavor to me. The other wings were my favorite. Sweet, salty and a little bit of spicy - just how I like my wings (and myself ;)). The area is small so don't expect to get any seating (if you do, you're lucky!). Super easy to order and take them to go.  Protip: parking is difficult in at times. Definitely order the honey salted pepper wings. BEST.
The wings at Hot Sauce and Panko are unreal. I consider myself a connoisseur of chicken wings and these are the best chicken wings on the west coast. I hsve tried for 9 years to find a good wing place and nowhere in SF bcompares to HS+P. They have a seemingly endless offering of different sauces too, some ambitious some traditional. The waffle is also delicious. Bummed U-Lee is gone but this is a great replacement.
I came to the new location (located on the corner of Jackson & Hyde in Nob Hill) this past weekend and am so happy about the new addition to the neighborhood.Food: I got the Yaki (Teriyaki) Wings & my bf got the Beer Wings and we split an order of fries. Soooo delicious and I cannot wait to try their other flavors. Service: We came about 30 mins before closing & had to wait ~25 minutes to get our food, which was surprising since it wasn't that crowded. There were people who came & ordered after us and received their food first, but it wasn't too big of a deal since we weren't in a huge rush.Ambiance: Definitely a grab-and-go place. There is no outside seating at the new location & only 2 tables inside (both of which are standing-only tables and would be really inconvenient to sit at if it was crowded).
I freaking love some good wings, and the wings were freaking good. We ordered Green (cilantro, jalepeno ginger sesame oil mix), Korean (house gochujang hot peppers), and Chris's (honey salty crispy black pepper). All three are considered their top sellers, and they were all delicious. I generally don't like too much pepper in my food, but I think Chris's was my favorite out of the three. Honestly, it's really hard to pick a favorite.The chicken was perfectly cooked throughout, not dry at all, and the outside was a good amount of crispy.The place is very tiny. There are two tables-for-two inside and a table outside that can fit four people comfortably. We ended up taking our to-go and eating it in the car. The kitchen is essentially open so you can see what's going on back there. They have shelves stocked with a bunch of sauces that you can purchase. I've never seen so many sauces for wings in my life. The wait was fairly short with a few people in front of us. Finding parking is a tad bit difficult but no surprise there. Really sad that I can't find any wings like these in Texas. I can only dream of the day I return to Hot Sauce and Panko for more delicious wings.
