ZOMG! Marathon plaza re-opened! It has NEW fountains! And NEW wooden benches!Also, I think it has NEW pigeons and NEW office workers!Yes, it's a little sad that neither Snack Depot nor Maya are hiding behind Marathon plaza now. And I will forever miss the meaningless three-level terraces. But, on the other hand, there is a farmers' market here sometimes, which is kind of cool. And it's still the best place to sit for lunch on its block. So that's cool, right?
This is a nice spot to relax and enjoy lunch outside on sunny days. Great place to enjoy the outdoors and this plaza is very clean. I absolutely adore the design and layout of this open space, it is very creative. Putting the fountain here is a wonderful idea. When one is feeling stressed, listening to the sound of water is another great take away that stress.One of the nearby businesses include:- FedEx Office Print & Ship Center- Red Dog Restaurant & Bar- Fearless Coffee- Urban Picnic- Lee's Deli- 24 Hour Fitness- Wells Fargo Bank- Andersen Bread
4 - stars. Nice spot to sit with coworkers and enjoy one of the fine establishments that make up the lunch triangle (Mehfil, Snack depot, or Maya). The fake grass really throws me off, I really feel like I'm in a concrete jungle :).
This is a park right by my work.  It has lots of stepped blocks, grassinesses, and benches, all around some very nice fountains.  I sit there and eat lunch every day, and even when it's a bit breezy, you can sit down where the wind doesn't get you and be warmed by the sun...  A beautiful break in the day.
