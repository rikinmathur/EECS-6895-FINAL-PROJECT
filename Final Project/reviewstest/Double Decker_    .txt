Great burgers and amazing shakes!I was staying at the Days Inn that shares a parking lot so I picked this place because it was super close.  I was alone with my three kids, preschooler and younger so they were in my enormous stroller which took up about half of the downstairs seating area. There is a bench outside but it was occupied so before I had a chance to wonder where I was going to squish my kids in so we could eat, the guy behind the counter started moving the tables and making space. He assured me that there was a upstairs seating so I didn't have to worry about taking up all of his space.The food was amazing, I thought it seemed pricey but I didn't expect it to be so good. They use local, hormone-free meat and the shakes were fresh enough that I got a few chunks of berry in mine.  The guy behind the counter also asked if I wanted to divide the two shakes I ordered amount my three kids and made sure to slice the burger I got for the older two to share for them.  He also stocked me up on napkins and condiments for the to-go bag since so mentioned that we were staying in the motel.  No complaints from me or my little ones at all.
2-1/4 stars. Don't get the fish and chips. That's probably obvious, but I went in and then thought maybe the fish wouldn't be quite as bad for me. I was wrong. Worst fish & chips I ever had. Batter like Fried shoe leather. A sliver of Fish somewhere hidden inside. And then they took the chips idea literally not understanding the mean steak fries in England. These were paper thin potato chips. They also had no lemon or vinegar available. With fish & chips on the menu?! That'll teach me not to order Hamburger or try to be a little bit healthy. I've had a burger here before. It was the right thing to have after too many beers, and messy and enjoyable. But far from extraordinary. Or worth $8. The bun is too soft and doesn't have great architecture. The beef is good but overcooked and only a quarter pound. The fries are too expensive. I really want to like this place because of the grass fed beef and odd location, but it's just not that good. And they should seriously take the fish off the menu. I even asked what kind of fish before I ordered and the guy said I'm not sure but lots of people order it. Foolish foolish people.
No frills. Just burgers.My friend and I were looking for a place that looked a) kid-friendly for her baby child and b) was cheap and filling. Double Decker was the closest thing to us because we were not about to spend $27 on fried chicken.So...the place looked bigger in the pictures. PEOPLE, can we please take photos that accurately describe the atmosphere?! Y'all with your fancy schmancy shots making it look like this place had more seating than it actually did...why?!Anyway. Yes, it's small, yes, it's attached to a Days Inn, so yes, I would've been skeptical, but you just can't go wrong with a burger that is simply a burger. Also, in the Asian-restaurant style I grew up with, EVERYTHING is all over the place and I think I must've been in the area where EVERYTHING goes. I grew up with this. You probably did not. I was used to it. You may not be. Probably something to keep in mind if ambience is more important to you than delicious burgers.Buddy got the western, which I totally wanted but I hate ordering the same thing, so I picked up a turkey buffalo burger (buffalo in that it's like buffalo wings, not like it's a buffalo or a turkey that thinks it's a buffalo or vice versa), because I was trying to be healthy. But yeah, I was at a burger place, and that wasn't gonna happen, so I ordered garlic fries because I'm a damn adult.We sat down at the few tables on the ground floor. Kinda grimy, but it looks like that kind of place, so whatever. Food came pretty quickly and was astoundingly delicious. Funny how you look at an unassuming place and think the food isn't gonna be good. That's your damn mind playing with you. What I learned is that I need more buffalo turkey burgers in my life. It's easier to eat than a buffalo chicken sandwich and extra delicious, despite being really messy. It's okay, though. The garlic fries saved all the things I spilled, which made them even more delicious.Here's the important thing, though. The little baby child is kind of close to being in his terrible twos. The tables are not exactly stable. So the kid pushes the table and the drinks fly off and it's a mess. Oh man, did we feel bad! But the guy was so nice about it. Straight up graciousness right there. He understood and remembered when his kids were that age, he told us as he cleaned our mess. He even gave us fresh drinks. I tried to pay for the drinks that we didn't buy afterward and he wouldn't hear of it. I have never been so pissed at myself for not having cash, because I wanted to tip this guy and his awesome service.I'll be back mainly because that guy was awesome and burgers are where it's at.
Fugitives must eat here. Or dates who don't want to be seen together. Or heck, make that dates who don't want to see each other. The fluorescent lights make God damn sure of that, along with sticky tables, and a big freezer in the corner upstairs where they store body parts in bad movies. The wings are the smallest I've ever seen. The flavor nothing to write home about. Through the course of dinner - if you can call it that - I actually got sad and depressed by the whole scene.Their only saving grace? The waiter. Warm, efficient, and normal. I hope he escapes soon.
Happy hour: cheap wings, cheap fries, cheap beer and wine. I mean rrly. What more do you need?!We're hungry and wandering the streets one afternoon and stumbled across this place saying to ourselves "oh yeah! The ol' Days Inn Burger Joint! Let's give it a go!"So we did! The owner was there training a new girl who was a little unsure of herself and shy, but a sweetheart nonetheless. No one else was there. We went upstairs, to the upper deck you might say, and had the place to ourselves. The owner brought our food up and accidentally brought an extra order of fries we didn't order, but he gave them to us anyway and ran back down to, totally unnecessarily, refund us our $2.and some change. Great little place to stop into when you're looking for that spot to be hit.
Double decker has THE BEST BURGER I have ever had!!! Me and my bf cycle In-N-Out, The Habit, and 5 Guys and this burger is by far our favorite! Every time we come here the burger patty is steaming hot like VISIBLY STEAMING they bring it to you straight off the grill. Happy hour is pretty sweet too! We live in Orange County and go out of our way to eat here when we visit. No doubts about this place. The boyfriend: DUDES! Get here now!I got a Yelp account just so I can rave about this place they deserve it.
After reading that Double Decker's burger was on Thrillist's "best under the radar" burgers in SF, a few friends and I decided to give it a try. We came by last Friday afternoon during happy hour, and the place (small as it is) was decently busy.The service, I will say, was excellent. My friend dropped her bottle of Corona and they brought her a new one. And of all the food, the onion rings were the best. My double-decker burger was fine, but nothing special. My friends' classic burgers were the same. The garlic fries were barely garlicky and the sweet potato fries, like the garlic fries, got soggy very fast. It's such an unassuming place, located attached to the Days Inn, but I really thought it might be our new go-to, "secret" spot. In a pinch, I'd go back (I'd love to try the Hawaiian burger), but there are so many great burger places in SF that - given a choice - I'd check out many others first.
I ordered like 6 burgers through DoorDash.1.I ordered my Original burger well done and I got medium rare. I can't eat this I threw it away.2.My co-worker ordered the California Burger medium rare, she got really rare..she ended up throwing it away.3.My boss ordered Onion Rings, she received FOUR onion rings, I shit you not..FOREAL!!!!Too bad I couldn't refund b/c it was through DoorDash, not a even a SORRY.I will not be ordering from here again.
The western burger is my favorite! No frills burger joint.  Really hits the spot for lunch.The buffalo wings are decent. They are crispy, but eat 'em while they're hot. they get soggy real quick!
My husband chose this place since he heard the burgers were good and they offered a variety of salads for me. Upon parking I immediately identified this place as a dive...it's located on the corner of a motel I certainly have never noticed in the heart of Hayes valley.Against my very instincts, I ordered the small cobb salad, and since the building is round and all the seating faces the kitchen, I could see the "chef" making my salad. On what looked like a 5x8" cutting surface (the prepping area was completely cluttered)  he chopped up fake cheese, spotty brown avocado, and two huge hard boiled eggs, placed them on top of some lettuce and topped it with a store bought salad dressing. Might I add, the kitchen was repugnantly dirty and unkept. I mean - the fake terra cotta floors were black. I was presented with the most unappetizing array of a meal. Needless to say, I could not bring myself to eat it. Who knows, perhaps there is a possibility the salad would have tasted amazingly insane....but from the LOOK of things it was improbable.
Very good Burgers..........however the last time I ordered delivery, everything was luke-warm....ARGH.
It was 8:45. They closed at 9. They said we had to get our burgers to go. We'd had drinks at Smugglers Cove earlier so I didn't care where I ate my burger. We ordered two double decker and a large fries. The gentle,an who took our order turned over a table and invited us to sit. When the burgers were cooked I went to grab them but the gentleman would have none of it. He brought them and then the fries with sides of BBQ and ranch. The burger was the best I've had in years. The meat was amazing and the two kinds of cheese were perfect. I can't recommend this place enough and I can't thank double decker enough for their hospitality.
We placed an office order through Eat24. The food was delivered promptly, but my sandwich was so burnt it was not edible. I called the restaurant to see if they could remake the sandwich and was told that they toast the buns the same way. The guy couldn't believe my sandwich was burnt. He finally said that I'm not their customer that I'm eat24's customer so go through them to get a refund for the sandwich. Thanks for the great customer service, last time any of our office orders from you.
They make a great tasting burger with spicy buffalo sauce.  Their onion rings are nicely battered, deep fried, and crispy.  It's my go to burger joint in Hayes Valley.  I would say the only improvement needed is their customer service.  Definitely worth a shot!
I usually enjoy this place- as the veggie burgers are good, but business is NOT very customer friendly. It took me 1 hour and 40 minutes (order promised within 45-60 minutes) to receive my order and the restaurant did not bother to call me to let me know it was going to be EXTREMELY late. I understand that things happen and sometimes restaurants run late, but very unprofessional and rude to not at least let the customer know the order will show up 40 minutes after the delivery window. No apology- Food was cold. I ordered via Eat24 and they tried to authorize a discount/credit of some kind for the poor customer service/delivery. They simply stated they don't give discounts for late deliveries. Seems to me that they don't care about customer courtesy... or customer retention for that matter.
One of my top wing spots in San Francisco.The inferno wings are my canonical buffalo wings. They have the exact sauce I crave when I'm craving buffalo wings. They're hot, crispy, and delicious. And I've eaten a LOT of wings in MANY different places. If you're looking for something beyond the standard Frank's+Butter, don't bother - it's just a classic that shouldn't be messed with.The delivery hampers the crispiness, and occasionally items get forgotten, but I've learned to just go in person and devour all of the wings. They'll be perfect.
I tried this place for the first time last week and really enjoyed it. I ordered the California burger which was huge, juicy, and delicious. I also tried their garlic fries which were super garlicky but not overly salted  - so perfect. I would definitely call them again for delivery.
Decent burgers and there's an upstairs seating area that is nice and cozy for when you're hanging out with a few friends.
Wings are small but pretty good. The hotness is about one level down from the name. Ordered a bunch for a work lunch and everyone was satisfied. Putting the order in was a little slow, I think the person on the phone was still waking up since I called at 10:30am. They also charged extra for ranch because I asked for 4, but they didn't bother to tell me that all the orders came with ranch naturally, so we just ended up with a ton of ranch.
Burger had too much garlic. Not that I think ground beef should have any garlic. Very disappointing. Was looking forward to good old-fashioned hamburger.
Great burgers and amazing shakes!I was staying at the Days Inn that shares a parking lot so I picked this place because it was super close.  I was alone with my three kids, preschooler and younger so they were in my enormous stroller which took up about half of the downstairs seating area. There is a bench outside but it was occupied so before I had a chance to wonder where I was going to squish my kids in so we could eat, the guy behind the counter started moving the tables and making space. He assured me that there was a upstairs seating so I didn't have to worry about taking up all of his space.The food was amazing, I thought it seemed pricey but I didn't expect it to be so good. They use local, hormone-free meat and the shakes were fresh enough that I got a few chunks of berry in mine.  The guy behind the counter also asked if I wanted to divide the two shakes I ordered amount my three kids and made sure to slice the burger I got for the older two to share for them.  He also stocked me up on napkins and condiments for the to-go bag since so mentioned that we were staying in the motel.  No complaints from me or my little ones at all.
2-1/4 stars. Don't get the fish and chips. That's probably obvious, but I went in and then thought maybe the fish wouldn't be quite as bad for me. I was wrong. Worst fish & chips I ever had. Batter like Fried shoe leather. A sliver of Fish somewhere hidden inside. And then they took the chips idea literally not understanding the mean steak fries in England. These were paper thin potato chips. They also had no lemon or vinegar available. With fish & chips on the menu?! That'll teach me not to order Hamburger or try to be a little bit healthy. I've had a burger here before. It was the right thing to have after too many beers, and messy and enjoyable. But far from extraordinary. Or worth $8. The bun is too soft and doesn't have great architecture. The beef is good but overcooked and only a quarter pound. The fries are too expensive. I really want to like this place because of the grass fed beef and odd location, but it's just not that good. And they should seriously take the fish off the menu.

My friends' classic burgers were the same. The garlic fries were barely garlicky and the sweet potato fries, like the garlic fries, got soggy very fast. It's such an unassuming place, located attached to the Days Inn, but I really thought it might be our new go-to, "secret" spot. In a pinch, I'd go back (I'd love to try the Hawaiian burger), but there are so many great burger places in SF that - given a choice - I'd check out many others first.
I ordered like 6 burgers through DoorDash.1.I ordered my Original burger well done and I got medium rare. I can't eat this I threw it away.2.My co-worker ordered the California Burger medium rare, she got really rare..she ended up throwing it away.3.My boss ordered Onion Rings, she received FOUR onion rings, I shit you not..FOREAL!!!!Too bad I couldn't refund b/c it was through DoorDash, not a even a SORRY.I will not be ordering from here again.
The western burger is my favorite! No frills burger joint.  Really hits the spot for lunch.The buffalo wings are decent. They are crispy, but eat 'em while they're hot. they get soggy real quick!
My husband chose this place since he heard the burgers were good and they offered a variety of salads for me. Upon parking I immediately identified this place as a dive...it's located on the corner of a motel I certainly have never noticed in the heart of Hayes valley.Against my very instincts, I ordered the small cobb salad, and since the building is round and all the seating faces the kitchen, I could see the "chef" making my salad. On what looked like a 5x8" cutting surface (the prepping area was completely cluttered)  he chopped up fake cheese, spotty brown avocado, and two huge hard boiled eggs, placed them on top of some lettuce and topped it with a store bought salad dressing. Might I add, the kitchen was repugnantly dirty and unkept. I mean - the fake terra cotta floors were black. I was presented with the most unappetizing array of a meal. Needless to say, I could not bring myself to eat it. Who knows, perhaps there is a possibility the salad would have tasted amazingly insane....but from the LOOK of things it was improbable.
Very good Burgers..........however the last time I ordered delivery, everything was luke-warm....ARGH.
It was 8:45. They closed at 9. They said we had to get our burgers to go. We'd had drinks at Smugglers Cove earlier so I didn't care where I ate my burger. We ordered two double decker and a large fries. The gentle,an who took our order turned over a table and invited us to sit. When the burgers were cooked I went to grab them but the gentleman would have none of it. He brought them and then the fries with sides of BBQ and ranch. The burger was the best I've had in years. The meat was amazing and the two kinds of cheese were perfect. I can't recommend this place enough and I can't thank double decker enough for their hospitality.
We placed an office order through Eat24. The food was delivered promptly, but my sandwich was so burnt it was not edible. I called the restaurant to see if they could remake the sandwich and was told that they toast the buns the same way. The guy couldn't believe my sandwich was burnt. He finally said that I'm not their customer that I'm eat24's customer so go through them to get a refund for the sandwich. Thanks for the great customer service, last time any of our office orders from you.
They make a great tasting burger with spicy buffalo sauce.  Their onion rings are nicely battered, deep fried, and crispy.  It's my go to burger joint in Hayes Valley.  I would say the only improvement needed is their customer service.  Definitely worth a shot!
I usually enjoy this place- as the veggie burgers are good, but business is NOT very customer friendly. It took me 1 hour and 40 minutes (order promised within 45-60 minutes) to receive my order and the restaurant did not bother to call me to let me know it was going to be EXTREMELY late. I understand that things happen and sometimes restaurants run late, but very unprofessional and rude to not at least let the customer know the order will show up 40 minutes after the delivery window. No apology- Food was cold. I ordered via Eat24 and they tried to authorize a discount/credit of some kind for the poor customer service/delivery. They simply stated they don't give discounts for late deliveries. Seems to me that they don't care about customer courtesy... or customer retention for that matter.
One of my top wing spots in San Francisco.The inferno wings are my canonical buffalo wings. They have the exact sauce I crave when I'm craving buffalo wings. They're hot, crispy, and delicious. And I've eaten a LOT of wings in MANY different places. If you're looking for something beyond the standard Frank's+Butter, don't bother - it's just a classic that shouldn't be messed with.The delivery hampers the crispiness, and occasionally items get forgotten, but I've learned to just go in person and devour all of the wings. They'll be perfect.
I tried this place for the first time last week and really enjoyed it. I ordered the California burger which was huge, juicy, and delicious. I also tried their garlic fries which were super garlicky but not overly salted  - so perfect. I would definitely call them again for delivery.
Decent burgers and there's an upstairs seating area that is nice and cozy for when you're hanging out with a few friends.
Wings are small but pretty good. The hotness is about one level down from the name. Ordered a bunch for a work lunch and everyone was satisfied. Putting the order in was a little slow, I think the person on the phone was still waking up since I called at 10:30am. They also charged extra for ranch because I asked for 4, but they didn't bother to tell me that all the orders came with ranch naturally, so we just ended up with a ton of ranch.
Burger had too much garlic. Not that I think ground beef should have any garlic. Very disappointing. Was looking forward to good old-fashioned hamburger.
Great burgers and amazing shakes!I was staying at the Days Inn that shares a parking lot so I picked this place because it was super close.  I was alone with my three kids, preschooler and younger so they were in my enormous stroller which took up about half of the downstairs seating area. There is a bench outside but it was occupied so before I had a chance to wonder where I was going to squish my kids in so we could eat, the guy behind the counter started moving the tables and making space. He assured me that there was a upstairs seating so I didn't have to worry about taking up all of his space.The food was amazing, I thought it seemed pricey but I didn't expect it to be so good. They use local, hormone-free meat and the shakes were fresh enough that I got a few chunks of berry in mine.  The guy behind the counter also asked if I wanted to divide the two shakes I ordered amount my three kids and made sure to slice the burger I got for the older two to share for them.  He also stocked me up on napkins and condiments for the to-go bag since so mentioned that we were staying in the motel.  No complaints from me or my little ones at all.
2-1/4 stars. Don't get the fish and chips. That's probably obvious, but I went in and then thought maybe the fish wouldn't be quite as bad for me. I was wrong. Worst fish & chips I ever had. Batter like Fried shoe leather. A sliver of Fish somewhere hidden inside. And then they took the chips idea literally not understanding the mean steak fries in England. These were paper thin potato chips. They also had no lemon or vinegar available. With fish & chips on the menu?! That'll teach me not to order Hamburger or try to be a little bit healthy. I've had a burger here before. It was the right thing to have after too many beers, and messy and enjoyable. But far from extraordinary. Or worth $8. The bun is too soft and doesn't have great architecture. The beef is good but overcooked and only a quarter pound. The fries are too expensive. I really want to like this place because of the grass fed beef and odd location, but it's just not that good. And they should seriously take the fish off the menu. I even asked what kind of fish before I ordered and the guy said I'm not sure but lots of people order it. Foolish foolish people.
No frills. Just burgers.My friend and I were looking for a place that looked a) kid-friendly for her baby child and b) was cheap and filling. Double Decker was the closest thing to us because we were not about to spend $27 on fried chicken.So...the place looked bigger in the pictures. PEOPLE, can we please take photos that accurately describe the atmosphere?! Y'all with your fancy schmancy shots making it look like this place had more seating than it actually did...why?!Anyway. Yes, it's small, yes, it's attached to a Days Inn, so yes, I would've been skeptical, but you just can't go wrong with a burger that is simply a burger. Also, in the Asian-restaurant style I grew up with, EVERYTHING is all over the place and I think I must've been in the area where EVERYTHING goes. I grew up with this. You probably did not. I was used to it. You may not be. Probably something to keep in mind if ambience is more important to you than delicious burgers.Buddy got the western, which I totally wanted but I hate ordering the same thing, so I picked up a turkey buffalo burger (buffalo in that it's like buffalo wings, not like it's a buffalo or a turkey that thinks it's a buffalo or vice versa), because I was trying to be healthy. But yeah, I was at a burger place, and that wasn't gonna happen, so I ordered garlic fries because I'm a damn adult.We sat down at the few tables on the ground floor. Kinda grimy, but it looks like that kind of place, so whatever. Food came pretty quickly and was astoundingly delicious. Funny how you look at an unassuming place and think the food isn't gonna be good. That's your damn mind playing with you. What I learned is that I need more buffalo turkey burgers in my life. It's easier to eat than a buffalo chicken sandwich and extra delicious, despite being really messy. It's okay, though. The garlic fries saved all the things I spilled, which made them even more delicious.Here's the important thing, though. The little baby child is kind of close to being in his terrible twos. The tables are not exactly stable. So the kid pushes the table and the drinks fly off and it's a mess. Oh man, did we feel bad! But the guy was so nice about it. Straight up graciousness right there. He understood and remembered when his kids were that age, he told us as he cleaned our mess. He even gave us fresh drinks. I tried to pay for the drinks that we didn't buy afterward and he wouldn't hear of it. I have never been so pissed at myself for not having cash, because I wanted to tip this guy and his awesome service.I'll be back mainly because that guy was awesome and burgers are where it's at.
Fugitives must eat here. Or dates who don't want to be seen together. Or heck, make that dates who don't want to see each other. The fluorescent lights make God damn sure of that, along with sticky tables, and a big freezer in the corner upstairs where they store body parts in bad movies. The wings are the smallest I've ever seen. The flavor nothing to write home about. Through the course of dinner - if you can call it that - I actually got sad and depressed by the whole scene.Their only saving grace? The waiter. Warm, efficient, and normal. I hope he escapes soon.
Happy hour: cheap wings, cheap fries, cheap beer and wine. I mean rrly. What more do you need?!We're hungry and wandering the streets one afternoon and stumbled across this place saying to ourselves "oh yeah! The ol' Days Inn Burger Joint! Let's give it a go!"So we did! The owner was there training a new girl who was a little unsure of herself and shy, but a sweetheart nonetheless. No one else was there. We went upstairs, to the upper deck you might say, and had the place to ourselves. The owner brought our food up and accidentally brought an extra order of fries we didn't order, but he gave them to us anyway and ran back down to, totally unnecessarily, refund us our $2.and some change. Great little place to stop into when you're looking for that spot to be hit.
Double decker has THE BEST BURGER I have ever had!!! Me and my bf cycle In-N-Out, The Habit, and 5 Guys and this burger is by far our favorite! Every time we come here the burger patty is steaming hot like VISIBLY STEAMING they bring it to you straight off the grill. Happy hour is pretty sweet too! We live in Orange County and go out of our way to eat here when we visit. No doubts about this place. The boyfriend: DUDES! Get here now!I got a Yelp account just so I can rave about this place they deserve it.
After reading that Double Decker's burger was on Thrillist's "best under the radar" burgers in SF, a few friends and I decided to give it a try. We came by last Friday afternoon during happy hour, and the place (small as it is) was decently busy.The service, I will say, was excellent. My friend dropped her bottle of Corona and they brought her a new one. And of all the food, the onion rings were the best. My double-decker burger was fine, but nothing special.

It's such an unassuming place, located attached to the Days Inn, but I really thought it might be our new go-to, "secret" spot. In a pinch, I'd go back (I'd love to try the Hawaiian burger), but there are so many great burger places in SF that - given a choice - I'd check out many others first.
